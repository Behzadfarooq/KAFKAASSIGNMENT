<p>Please use more often the talk pages. And you can make better use of edit summaries than provoking other people.

<p>From your latest edits, apart from the pov-pushing in Macedonia related articles, I've noticed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wyoming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30811862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wyoming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30811862" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=West_Virginia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30811555" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=West_Virginia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30811555" rel="nofollow">that</a>. If you didn't wrote the other (rather provoking) edit summaries, I would guess you didn't know that you can write an edit summary. Since you know that feature, I suggested instead of writing those that you wrote, when you do a revert write "revert: reason" or "partial revert: reason", and when you add a link to mk write a useful edit summary like "+mk interwiki" or something similar. I didn't said anything about vandalism, and indeed it would be better if instead of reverting each other, people would try to talk about and see what can be done. Take care. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 22:03, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>He is close to the line? Miskin also violated the 3RR. Plus, that what I'm writing in the St. Cyril article is true, I'm not spreading propaganda as Miskin does. Cyril gave the Slavonic alphabet to Slavs, and that's why I think the Slavonic name of him should be mentioned there. Regards and please reconsider who is violating 3RR and the facts. <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a> 19:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You were much closer to the line between edit-warring and vandalism, so it is a fair decision. I'm always using neutral sources for my edits, something which I would advise you to start doing as well in order to be taken seriously. You also should use the discussion page more often and prevent your ethnic feelings from dominating over WP neutral policy. You were practically stalking me upon doing those reverts, hence why they couldn't be regarded by anyone as content dispute in the first place. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 20:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not push a Greek POV, but an NPOV.</p>
<p><b>Greece's POV</b>: "Macedonian" should appear nowhere in said ethnic group's name.</p>
<p><b>FYROM's POV</b>: The said ethnic group should be called "Macedonian".</p>
<p><b>NPOV</b>: A qualifier is needed (i.e. to qualify "Macedonian")...for example, "Slav Macedonian", "Macedonian Slav".</p>
<p>Simovski, a Yugoslavian, would naturally refer to the ethnicity as simply "Macedonian".</p>
<p>An aside: I love how Slav-Macedonians are always quick to point out that "[they] exist". Nobody is saying that you don't exist as a distinct nationality; however, your nation has made some offensive claims against one of its neighbouring countries, Greece.</p>
<p>What, do you expect that you will get zero reaction? If we don't protest against your irredentism and your dubious historical claims then where does that leave us? Shall we also change our textbooks to indicate that Alexander the Great spread Slavonic culture around the known world in 330BC?</p>
<p>Alexander spoke Attic (Koine) Greek and the Macedonian Greek dialect. He did not speak any type of Slavic language. This should close the door on the issue; however, from my knowledge of your nation's propaganda, you will twist facts to your will in order to prove that day is night and night is day....and please don't give me any lame quotes from Borza or Baiden, who are obviously grasping at straws.--<a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPrudenceBumpkin_9db7.html" title="User:PrudenceBumpkin">PrudenceBumpkin</a> 02:24, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Haha...what a joke! You don't even realize that your old flag and constitution were the two most offensive things, like EVER! The funniest thing is that Vergina is in a part of Macedonia that never even had a Slav-speaking population.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for your nation's dubious historical claims re ancestry from Alexander and Philip, maybe Greeks would feel a bit more relaxed with the whole situation. However, your nation's propaganidists continue to make chauvanistic claims even though your own Kiro Gligorov called him "Alexander the <b>Greek</b>"--<a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPrudenceBumpkin_9db7.html" title="User:PrudenceBumpkin">PrudenceBumpkin</a> 00:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I think is the opposite - your nation's dubious historical claims. I don't wanna talk about Greece's history because is the most "unclear" and "secret" history in whole Europe.

<p>Hi, Bomac, The Macedonian question is a very difficult one not only because of the various points of view, but also because of confusion in the terms. For example, the word Macedonia can have several meanings, however Republic of Macedonia is unambiguous. Now, how about Macedonian? Here, it becomes really difficult, especially if we talk about Greek Macedonia. How would you call a Greek living in Macedonia? Is she a Macedonian, or not? She certainly would call herself a Macedonian, even if she is kind enough to call you a Macedonian, maybe a fellow Macedonian? Oh, yes, this kind of things occur at a lot of places. Here in Quebec, we call everybody who lives here a Quebecker, but if somebody is of French descent we call her a Québécois. I would think that people would say things like "in places like Florina there is a slavic Macedonian population" because saying there is a "Macedonian population" looks lika a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleonasm.html" title="Pleonasm">pleonasm</a> because Florina is a Macedonian town, so everybody is Macedonian there. How about a member of the Albanian minority in the Republic of Macedonia? Is she an Albanian, a Macedonian, or both? We have lots of Greek Canadians, French Canadians, Macedonian Canadians here in Canada. However, a Macedonian Greek would be more likely be identified as somebody speaking Greek and living in Macedonia than a person with Macedonian mother tongue living in Greece. Unfortunately, there is no solution to this dilemma. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 17:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed your edits from the article because the accusations you made were very grave but you did not provide any reliable sources to verify them.

<p>well, I refer you to the discussion archives; this has all been discussed at length.

<p>Hey Bomac, I just noticed how amazed you were on the religious icon photo from Daniel tanevski talk page, and I just wanted to let you know that thats nothing compared to all the other proof of Greek lies regarding Macedonia. So here are some links to other photos you might find interesting.</p>

<p>You already gave me the answer, thank you. My question was more meant rhetorically. I noticed that some Bulgarian(?) editors think that Macedonian is not spoken in Bulgaria. Some also assert that the slavic language spoken by many Greeks is indeed Bulgarian and not Macedonian. (I suppose that the language spoken by <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomak.html" title="Pomak">Pomaks</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Thrace_ad1c.html" title="Western Thrace">Western Thrace</a> is considered Bulgarian and not Macedonian, am I right?). The reason I raise this question is because of the concept of a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect_continuum.html" title="Dialect continuum">dialect continuum</a> between the various variants of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Slavic_languages_c7c6.html" title="South Slavic languages">south Slavic languages</a>. Bulgarian and Macedonian are standard languages, the latter being standardized only in 1945. The situation is similar to that in <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace.html" title="Alsace">Alsace</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxemburg.html" title="Luxemburg">Luxemburg</a>. In Alsace, the language spoken (mainly by the rural population) is an <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alemannic_German_e0a2.html" title="Alemannic German">alemannic German</a> dialect known as <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsatian_language.html" title="Alsatian language">Alsatian</a> (French <i>Alsacien</i>, alemannic: <i>Ellsässerdytsch</i>). This is not a standardized language, and is very similar to the dialect spoken at the other side of the Rhine around the German city of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freiburg_im_Breisgau_81fd.html" title="Freiburg im Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau</a>. German was an official language in Alsace until 1919, and was also declared official during the German occupation 1940-1945. Today's Alsatians do not consider themselves speaking German, but Alsatian. This is different from the situation in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liechtenstein.html" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorarlberg.html" title="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>, where the local dialects, which are very similar to Alsatian, are considered variations of German. So if you look up the article on the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a>, you will notice that France is not mentioned as a place where German is spoken. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 17:09, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Bulgarian editors think that Macedonian is not spoken in Bulgaria by obvious reasons which I'm tired of mentioning them. And I don't see any concrete problem why not to be mentioned that Macedonian is spoken in Bulgaria (still, it's a separate language, no matter of the similarities).

<p>Hey Bomac. Since the last few weeks I was involved in a revert war on the English wikipedia on articles on cites in Northern Greece.

Unfortunatly, Greek users have outnumbered me are replacing <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_language.html" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian language</a> with South Slavic, Slavic, Turkish, Bulgarian, or are deleting that part as a whole.

<p>Hi there! I hope you're well. I mildly question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=36108739&amp;oldid=36107833" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=36108739&amp;oldid=36107833" rel="nofollow">this reversion</a>. I see you hail from Macedonia and no disrespect is intended, but my edit (as stated) is more to reflect a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> regarding the country's name. Many country articles have such recapitulations for clarity (<i>q.v.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, etc.), and – despite your or my misgivings about this – there are many legitimate references to FYROM. Moreover, this edit is partially and hopefully to forestall others who might be <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28Greece%29_f0f8.html" title="Macedonia (Greece)">more impassioned</a> to expand on this issue unnecessarily in the introduction, which currently expands on prior manifestations of Macedonia. In your reversion, you also nixed minor copyedits made eleswhere.</p>
<p>Personally, I see little reason why <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Macedonia</a> should be redirected so (and therein lies the wisdom of the piped link), but nothing exists in isolation.

<p>Hello Bomac! How's it been? Where were you all these past days?</p>
<p>I heard from I think User:VMORO or someone else (can't be specific) that Macedonians are Serbinized Bulgarians. While I think that this theory is somewhat propaganda, I want to hear an opinion from someone neutral from Macedonia! (you perhaps).</p>
<p>P. S. Can you understand the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Croatian_e9af.html" title="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a> language? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 12:45, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Одлично!</p>
<p>Постоји тачан разлог зашто сам те то питао. (ај' ипак ћу Енглески језик): Here there are radical things in Montenegro. We know with certainity that in the past there was atleast some (some claim major) Serbian national element in Montenegro. Today, 35% of Montenegro's population just switched from Montenegrin nationality to Serbian, making the Montenegrins lose absolute majority in Montenegro. The Serbian language is still the official and major language is Montenegr (even the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegrin_language.html" title="Montenegrin language">Montenegrin language</a> is a minor one).</p>
<p>So, as you see, the situation with Montenegro is far more complicated beyond anyone's understanding. I heard from some Bulgarian users that the situation is the same in Macedonia, but I doubtfully think that. Are there some similiar things (pro-Bulgarian or similiar movements) in Macedonia? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:14, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw a map, the first ethnic map that recognized the Macedonians as a distinct ethnic group, but I am doubtful rather that you will like it. What do you think about it? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 14:26, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes&#160;:)</p>
<p>Actually, the map doesn't present the Macedonians as Serbs. It presents the territories that the Macedonians left with the Serbs in the migrations (nothern Macedonia) as "<i>ethnic Serb</i>", but note that others are presented as a distinct group - <i>Slavs from Macedonia</i>. After all, between 10% and 20% of Serbian are of Macedonian origin: three of my close friends and a wikipedian by the name of (probably) Nikola Smolenski (-surname). It's actually from that same basis that I say that we can simply use: <i>All Macedonians are Serbs</i> or <i>All Serbs are Macedonians</i> both without being wrong (the differences are far too small). --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 16:43, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I think you should know that your userpage seems to have a problem when viewed through Internet Explorer and Firefox. Also, I noticed that you are planning a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Portal%7EMacedonia_b453.html" title="Portal:Macedonia">Portal:Macedonia</a> for your country. I think that's asking for trouble, as it will certainly provoke a reaction from Greek and Bulgarian users. If you do have your heart set on making a portal, then I suggest you try a different name; as I'm assuming that <a href="../../../f/y/r/Portal%7EFYROM_3177.html" title="Portal:FYROM">Portal:FYROM</a> is out of the question&#160;:-) how about <a href="../../../r/e/p/Portal%7ERepublic_of_Macedonia_7893.html" title="Portal:Republic of Macedonia">Portal:Republic of Macedonia</a>, Portal:Macedonia (republic)? It's not that bad; after all, there is a <a href="../../../p/e/o/Portal%7EPeople%27s_Republic_of_China_f077.html" title="Portal:People's Republic of China">Portal:People's Republic of China</a> instead of a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Portal%7EChina_b2cb.html" title="Portal:China">Portal:China</a> (which is a redirect - <a href="../../../m/a/c/Portal%7EMacedonia_b453.html" title="Portal:Macedonia">Portal:Macedonia</a> could be a redirect if you want).</p>
<p>I've been thinking of a Portal:Balkans, but it sounds like too much work&#160;:-) BTW in my opinion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABomac&amp;diff=37076034&amp;oldid=36989501" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABomac&amp;diff=37076034&amp;oldid=36989501" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit of yours, removing the ridiculous land claims in Greece shows that you do not have an extreme POV agenda, so I'm sure we can co-operate.</p>

<p>basicly, Macedonia is not in any sort of a union with Bulgaria, the majority of it's populace does not speak the Bulgarian language, nor is it the official language of Macedonia; a large contigent of the population is Bulgarian (large enough for Macedonians to lose absolute majority), the Macedonian national anthems do not express Bulgariandom (my case is Onamo Onamo), nor did the current Macedonian national anthem have Bulgarian determinations; Macedonia is not the home of the Bulgarian rulling dynasties, nor did every single Macedonian ruler express himself as Bulgarian, and the Macedonian and Bulgarian cultures are not the same?</p>
<p>Sorry for that long post.&#160;:) Correct me if I am right (I chose everything that can be applied to Montenegro). --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 21:09, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, the two are different.</p>
<p>Here in SCG, we learn a lot NPOV about the Macedonians; to evade conflicts from all sides, we refer to you as <i>Slavs from Macedonia</i> in the Medieval Ages. We say that the reason of the disappearing of a distinct Macedonian group is assimilation from the recently-arrived Bulgar Asian tribe, and the growing <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian.html" title="Serbian">Serbian</a> <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">Kingdom</a>, later <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">Empire</a>, which, in the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a> defined only <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarians.html" title="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> as its citizens. But, you won't like the following part - we say that the Macedonian Slavs have been <i>peacefully</i> assimilated into the Serbian nation from the Medieval Ages to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Age_39a0.html" title="Industrial Age">Industrial Age</a>. Afterwards we learn about the VMORO movement that turned itself from a national liberation movemenr into a pro-Bulgarian propaganda that eventually killed King Alexander I Karađorđević the unifier. We then say that the <a href="../../../o/b/r/Obrenovi%C4%87.html" title="Obrenović">Obrenović</a> Princes have continuosly fought for the recognizing of a Macedonian nation, since most international accords noted you as Bulgarians. In the heat of battle during World War I, in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_London_0427.html" title="Treaty of London">Treaty of London</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> Serbia had to give up Macedonia to Bulgaria. After an official Macedonian protest, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87_6f8a.html" title="Nikola Pašić">Nikola Pašić</a> promised the Macedonians that Serbia will always be their protector, and declines. The Macedonians declared themselves as <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> and as <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavs.html" title="Yugoslavs">Yugoslavs</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>. We say that that was because it was the most favourite and applicable choice - the Serbs were one of the three constitutional peoples of the Kingdom and were in good relations with the Macedonians. However, we say that the Macedonians did not oppose the government, nor this assimilation.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is pretty much the same like there. What do you think. Is there anything that you do not agree with or is POV? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 00:05, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bomac! I have some issues I would like to inform you about. Have you taken a look at the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarians.html" title="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> article lately? If not, embrace yourself. It is clearly denying the very existence of Macedonians. I have been reverting the edits of this annomynous user by my self and it seems that administrators do not care about the content this user has been adding in. According to the article, 1,300,000 Bulgarians live in the Republic of Macedonia, and an extra million has been added to the total Bulgarian population. Sockpupets have outnumbered me and I cannot keep up with saving the article from these internet users. I would appreciate if you can help me do something about it.

<p>Ok Bomac, no problem&#160;:-). BTW, did you here anything about the Macedonian tomb from Alexander's time that the Greeks recently uncovered in Pella. It's the biggist tomb yet ever found in Greece and supposedly "holds the answer to the mystery" of whether the ancient Macedonians were Greek or not. The tomb belonged to a rich or possibly royal ancient Macedonian family which contains 8 chambers full of artifacts. In my opinion, the Greeks shouldn't lay a finger on those artifacts until a certified archeologist from western Europe or America comes and see's what they really are. According to news sources they uncovered jellewery, gold, statues, and other items, but what really stuns me is that another news site reports that Greek archeologists just claimed that the tomb was supposedly "looted over the years" despite its first discovery last Friday. And yet Greek historians are still not saying anything yet whether the tomb proves the Greekness of Macedonians. Anyway can you tell me some feedback on what you know and about its appearence in the media in Skopje.

<p>I do not see why you continually revert the informaton on Bulgarians. The Bulgarian upper numbers include Macedonians in the diaspora. Either we lose those estimates or we MUST add Macedonia, otherwise there will be way too much repeating of statistics. Look at the note I added.

<p>First, thanks for the classification — I certainly don't regard myself as a nationalist, although I love my homeland and am always striving to learn more about it. Samuil's Kingdom is really an interesting point of discussion, but I believe the Macedonian theory is a bit too alternative and relies on too little evidence and too many speculations.</p>
<p>Basically, my opinion concurs with the one in the <i><a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuil.html" title="Samuil">Samuil</a></i> article. An interesting point is, why would <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_II_6250.html" title="Basil II">Basil II</a> be nicknamed Βουλγαροκτόνος (Bulgaroktonus, Bulgar-slayer), if the empire he crushed wasn't Bulgarian? I know your possible answer, another theory that says <i>Bulgarian</i> didn't mean <i>Bulgarian</i> back then, but had the broader sense of a <i>Slav Christian</i>... but don't you think counting on a theory to prove another theory and having little evidence to prove each of them individually is a bit too much?</p>
<p>Just my thoughts&#160;:) Thanks for the question. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">→ Тодор Божинов / Todor Bozhinov</a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 12:59, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with what you say about the nations today and in the Middle Ages. South Slavs are really a continuum, they just fit together, but the 19th and 20th century nationalism that separated them into nation-states left many border peoples divided and claimed by the neighbouring states, such as the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorani_%28Kosovo%29_ca3f.html" title="Gorani (Kosovo)">Gorani</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Hmm... I come to other conclusions when reading what you've written. <i>Zara</i> is the Italian name of the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatia.html" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatian</a> town of <a href="../../../z/a/d/Zadar.html" title="Zadar">Zadar</a> in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> (held by Byzantium after 812 and significantly connected to the history Venice), and <i>Slavinia</i> is damn close to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavonia.html" title="Slavonia">Slavonia</a>, another region in modern-day Croatia. Also, as far as I know, before the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Crusade_f9d6.html" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> (launched in 1095) Venice had little to do with our part of the Balkans and was more engaged in incrasing its influence in the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic.html" title="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>. So it's more likely to me that the document describes events in contemporary Croatia, rather than Bulgaria and Macedonia. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">→ Тодор Божинов / Todor Bozhinov</a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 18:21, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Здраво! Тукушто го креирав порталот Macedonia, па се надевам на твоја поддршка околу уредувањето и бранењето на страницата! Поздрав <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a> 12:07, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zdravej! I can't help but feel that a storm is brewing... What do you think should be done about the portal? We could come to an agreement between ourselves or, we could take it to <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a> and get a formal comments on renaming. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 14:47, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is called "Zdravo!".</p>
<p>Look, agreement will be fine, but as I can see Miskin "excitates" too fast for an agreement... C'mon, what's the problem - there is only ROM mentioned in the texts, no "Macedonia" and stuff. My opinion is that it should stay "Portal:Macedonia". After all, the example you give with China is about a <b><a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a></b>. Greek Macedonia is a <b><a href="../../../r/e/g/Region.html" title="Region">region</a></b> of which you can write in "Portal:Greece". <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a> 14:57, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, as you've probably noticed, we've all got into this endless cycle of verbal jabs on talk pages. Take an olive branch of peace and let's stop worrying about these mysterious ancient Macedonians. There is more recent history to discuss, such as the presumed pan Balkan Alliance against the Ottomans <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Balkan_War_9bbb.html" title="First Balkan War">First Balkan War</a> - obviously, we can co-operate <a href="../../../n/u/v/Image%7ENuvola_apps_gaim.png_7f0e.html" class="image" title=":-)"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/3c/Nuvola_apps_gaim.png/25px-Nuvola_apps_gaim.png" alt=":-)" width="25" height="25" longdesc="../../../n/u/v/Image%7ENuvola_apps_gaim.png_7f0e.html" /></a> --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 11:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Bomac. I think that the Macedonian portal is great&#160;! Its just that I previously thought it was going to be about the whole Macedonian region. But I think it suits the Republic of Macedonia well. Anyway, perhaps this idea (Macedonia region) could lead to the creation of another portal, <b>Portal: Macedonians</b>, just like <a href="../../../s/e/r/Portal%7ESerbs_551e.html" title="Portal:Serbs">Portal: Serbs</a>.

<p>Здраво Бомак, добро е што засега работата околу порталот оди глатко. Само според мене треба малку да пазиме на тоа што го ставаме таму за да не предизвикаме нова едит војна таму и проблеми околу името на порталот.
