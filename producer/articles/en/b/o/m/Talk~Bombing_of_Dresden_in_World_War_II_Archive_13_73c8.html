The State">Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State</a> article which to date I am the sole editor, but it is OR to link the findings to the Dresden raids) -- There is nothing to link the "Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State" article to this article. Just as they say that their findings are specific to those two Atomic bombings not to all atomic bombings, so their analysis of area bombardment is complicated and without an expert to confirm it, any linking of the two specific A-bomb raids to the Dresden is Original Research, unless you can find a source which makes the link. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>11:47, 17 Oct 2006 PBS (→Legal obligations - Reduce this to a paragraph as the arguments are presented in the link and none of them are specific to Dresden) -- May as well put in only the general point and leave the rest out as they are covered by the link instead of repeating information already in the link. The whole point of moveing the section out of this article into the area bombardment article was because of the size of this article. It seems silly to drag that information back into this article piecemeal when the article is so large already --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Debate over bombings</span></h2>
<p>I think that the current structure of the debate part of of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the bombing a war crime?
<ul>
<li>5.1 Legal obligations</li>
<li>5.2 Notable mainstream opinions</li>
<li>5.3 The case for the bombing as a war crime</li>
<li>5.4 The case against the bombing as a war crime</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>or the alternative I have been working with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the bombing a war crime?
<ul>
<li>5.1 Legal obligations</li>
<li>5.2 The case for the bombing as a war crime</li>
<li>5.3 The case against the bombing as a war crime</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>is an impediment to the development of the article because the headings force the argument along legalistic not moral lines. I think that these headings frustrate those who wish to highlight that although the strategic bombing campaigns may (or may not) have been lawful, there is a legitimate moral dimension to the debate. I think that we should take a leaf out of the article <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki_2ade.html" title="Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> and use headings closer to theirs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debate over bombings
<ul>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Opposition
<ul>
<li>Inherently immoral</li>
<li>Militarily unnecessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two sub-sub headings have been added during the last few months and may or may not be suitable for this article.

<dd>This certainly is an option, but if you take a look at the <i>case for</i> article now, I don't think it drifts too far from the war crime focus...and if not focusing on that, debunking the Allied claims. Yes it is - has - been limiting, but I think it just may work now. Alternatively, at second glance the case against does seem to be broken into several parts already, sans the titles to announce these jumps.--72.92.119.89 14:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The majority opinion is that it was not a war crime, but the moral question is far more evenly balanced and would make it much easier to present a balanced POV. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>2) 72.94.75.178: This is nonsense as the last sentence in the previous sections says "<i>the Hamburg public prosecutor's office decided that Udo Voigt's description of the 1945 RAF bombing of Dresden as a "holocaust" was a constitutionally protected exercise of free speech because defamation of the Jewish dead was not the primary aim of his argument.</i>" That is a long way from "validated the opinion that the bombing of Dresden was indeed a holocaust", because as you will of course be aware an older less often used meaning of holocaust is conflagration which is also another word for firestorm, but unless one is a neo-Nazi the word holocaust is not used as an alternative for firestorm in writing about such events in the 21st century. -<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:27, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>4) This link is not made in the Simon Jenkins reference for the sentence. What he wrote was "Everything I have ever heard or read about Dresden convinces me that it was a crime against humanity".

<p>6) Which internal memorandum? I would be very surprised that those fighting the Germans in World war to did not have "personal prejudices, [and] anti-German sentiment" What are you (72.94.75.178) are trying to say herem because afaict it has nothing to do with bombing Dresden being a war crime. If one is going to put forward that argument Bomber Harris put it better "<i>The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everyone else, and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, and half a hundred other places, they put their rather naive theory into operation.

<dd>My reading of it is different and as this briefing is already mentioned briefly in the "reasons for the raid" section, I am removing. BTW you have not provided your source for your edited version of the Group briefing paper:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than Manchester, is also [by] far the largest unbombed built-up area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter, with refugees pouring westwards and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter... but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most...and to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Here is the same Briefing papaer provided by From Longmante in <i>The Bombers</i> page 333:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany ... is also far the largest unbombed built-up area the enemy has got ... At one time well known for its china, Dresden has developed into a industrial city of first-class importance and ... is of major value for controlling the defence of that part of the front now threatened by marshal Koniev's breakthrough. ... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most ... to prevent the use of the city in the way of a further advance, and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do.</i>"</dd>

<dd><b>What evidence are you looking for? The Allies decided what constituted warcrimes after the war, based on their own perception of events. What Z's description does is highlight the cruelty of the bombing, which in combination with the rest of the article, is paired with the Allied nonchallant attitude and likely intentions to drive home a point. If the Anglo-Americans had indeed tried to turn as many germans into "human soup" as possible...how is that not a war crime? I don't mean to draw the comparison because I do not forward it, but here are some key words that might bring to mind an event that was a war crime: "kill as many as possible", "targeting innocents", "no regrets, intentional"...Do I have to point you in the direction of Nuremberg once more?--72.94.75.178 03:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>The point is that I am making no particular unsourced as to whether it proves or disproves the case of dresden as a war crime. It is simply something that is related because:
<ul>
<li>the court decided that sheer destruction and inhumanity were important in the its decision</li>
<li>but there was no conclusion made regarding nuclear weaponry.</li>
<li>The court, like the Greco-German tribunal, also found that the 1907 Hague of sea and land did apply to the rules for the skies.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Thus, within the court of law, related rulings should be taken into effect; our audience is the judge and it is only fair that they have access to all material related to the legal status of aerial bombardment bar none.--72.92.116.74 04:53, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no need for this to be true as the information is available via a link and the section in the link is considerablely more detailed than it can be here. It was originally moved out of this article because of space considerations because it applies to all World War II bombings, not just Dresden or even just the Allies' campaigns. Further there are other sources which bring a NPOV to the Greco-German tribunal and Shimoda which are in the link article but which do not need to be presented here, all these additional arguments are not specific to Dresden and can be missed out saving space in the Dresden article which was the reason for moving the section out in the first place. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 15:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To follow up on your comment in the history "<i>gomez's claim is misrepresented...what about geneva? also, it is important to briefly mention the other two, independent findings. others, see talk</i>" I have picked the wording deliberatly:
<dl>
<dd><i>During World War II there was no posititive <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_humanitarian_law.html" title="International humanitarian law">international humanitarian law</a> (specific agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument) governing aerial bombardment.'</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>and given two sources. Note that one of them is Shimoda which says "No general treaty respecting aerial bombardment has been concluded". The wording "posititive international humanitarian law" can be found in both sources Gomez "The absence of positive law ...", and "<i>On the strength of this fact, the defendant State argues that the question of violation of positive international law cannot arise, since the use of an atomic bomb was not expressly prohibited by positive international law inasmuch as there was neither a customary rule of international law nor treaty law-prohibiting its use at that time.</i>" As you can see the term is not contensions and means what is described in the article.</dd>

<p>Maybe you are right about the bombing comparison being a little unfocused, but I find it cute that this indictment:</p>
<p>Some have accused the Allies of incinerating German cities in 1944 and 1945 simply because they could.<sup id="_ref-CH2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CH2" title="">[4]</a></sup> It certainly does not appear that the Allies were unaware of the horrific effect of firebombing. Over a year and a half prior, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had urged British scientists to cook up "a new kind of weather" in lieu of a raid on Hamburg that killed between 45,000 and 48,000. Critical to the devestation during the July 1943 bombardment was firestorm effect that Churchill praised as a success. In all fairness, the Germans had utilized these methods during the <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz.html" title="Blitz">Blitz</a> in 1940. However, as historian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Rhodes_53bc.html" title="Richard Rhodes">Richard Rhodes</a> states, there were only 20,083 civilian deaths during the entire <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a> compared to the 45,000 Germany suffered during one instance in Hamburg.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup>--72.92.15.61 02:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>has been replaced with this comparative nonsense:</p>
<p>Some have accused the Allies of incinerating German cities in 1944 and 1945 simply because they could.<sup id="_ref-CH2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CH2" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Allies were aware of the effects of firebombing as British cities had been subject to them during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a>.--72.92.15.61 02:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it not true that the "the Allies were aware of the effects of firebombing as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz"? If so then why do we need the rest of the information which has nothing to do with whether using such methods were a war crime. I would remove the whole paragraph completly because I do not think it has anything to do with whether the bombing of Dresden was a war crime. However I am trying to meet you (72.92.15.6) half way but for this to work there has to be give and take on both sides.

<dd>Perhaps, but I still find it extremely confusing and difficult to follow. I suggest that such a volumous and lengthy discussion should be written <font color="#800000">in colors. As for your comment, it is "comparative nonsense" because the numbers speak for themselves and omitting them - and suggesting the opposite - is deceitful and misleading. As for everything else, it has already been explained at length and I do not feel the need to repeat things like it was "Apfel, not Voigt" and the opinion of the Guardian - or whatever it was - should not read as the opinion of anyone other than the guardian. Another, the NPD is NPD, not NPDG, and so on and so forth. I've said all of this before.</font>--72.94.204.107 22:27, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Use red if you like I don't mind, but please make sure that you indent (as not all people are colour sighted). I do not think that placing you replies in a block at the end of the section helps because if makes it very difficult to follow individual threads. For example you have mixed up "comparative nonsense" and NPD in the same paragraph, while placing them indented (in red if you wish) under my comments above in the threads would make it much easier to follow. So I will not respond to these comments here but in the threads above if I think it helps to build a consensus. However to your point on mentioning the people who are making war crime accusations was recently covered on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAllied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II_8099.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_evidence" title="Talk:Allied war crimes during World War II">Talk:Allied war crimes during World War II#Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence</a> which was in response to something you wrote, so I presume you have already read it, but I will repeat it here for those who are following this thread and have not done so.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> the latter has a section called "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence" it "<i>Exceptional claims should be supported by multiple credible and verifiable sources, especially with regard to historical events or politically-charged issues.</i>"and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> in the section "When you add content" "<i>The need for citations is especially important when writing about opinions held on a particular issue. <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Avoid weasel words</a> such as, "Some people say…" Instead, make your writing <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>: find a specific person or group who holds that opinion, mention them by name, and give a citation to a reputable publication in which they express that opinion.</i>"</p>
<p>The views that conventional area bombing in World WAr II was a war crime (and not just morally questionable) is not one which is widely held in the English speaking nations. For this reason any article on en.wikipedia which states that it was a war crime should contain the name of the person or organisation who are making the accusations because they are "<i>Surprising or apparently important claims that are not widely known.</i>" (<a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">WP:RD</a> "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence")</p>
<p>Also most of claims the section "The case against the bombing as a war crime" are from one source with some details added from other sources and the main source, which is claiming it was not a war crime, is mentioned by name at the start of the section, most of the other sources are used to fill out details of the claims made by the Military of the United States and as such are not making claims that it was not a war crime. For things like "the fear of a Nazi breakout similar to the Battle of the Bulge may have weighed on the minds of Allied planners" we can add "According to Frederick Taylor" if you like but the text was placed there independently of Taylor as a reference (and I altered the wording to be closer to what Taylor says), I only retrofitted the reference because you asked of one personally I did not think that fact it is controversial enough to need a reference. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 23:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We seemed to have reached a compromise on this one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hannah Cleaver, writing in the Daily Telegraph. makes the point that "Strictly speaking, the word 'holocaust,' which comes from the ancient Greek for 'burnt', might seem apt for Dresden, much of it immolated by the fires started by the RAF's incendiary bombs.

<p>It is not whether you can name a single German -- I would not expect you to be able too -- It is the logic of the sentence which is important, namely that unless some Germans had thought Voigt statements were a possible violation of the law the Hamburg prosecutors office would not have looked into the matter and made the statment they did. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 01:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

As for "thinking it should be a violation of Holocaust denial legislation", I see no reason why you shouldn't be held to the same standard. I suggest that if you wish to make this claim, you find the source to support it.

<dd>The initial pathfinders of No. 5 Group RAF used the stadium as a location point (presumably because it would show up clearly on their <a href="../../../h/2/s/H2S_radar_9de5.html" title="H2S radar">H2S radar</a> systems). No. 5 group then sector bombed (different headings and timings for each aircraft). The assigned starting aiming point for the second wave (No. 3 and 6 Groups RAF) was the Altmarket but as that was already on fire the master bomb-aimer moved the target indicators southwest to Loebtau and Friedrich and then to Suedvorstadt (with the Hauptbahnhof), then Johnannsadt. AFAICT the RAF dropped close to 342,000 4 pound stick incendiaries (including about 30,000 of the nasty ones with anti-handleing exposive in them) but no petroleum bombs. Ignoring those USAAF bombers who bombed Prague by mistake, the USAAF attacking the next day at around noon, they and aimed at the Friedrichstadt marshalling yards (from a height of 28,000 feet), and, because of cloud smoke etc, some waves bombed using <a href="../../../h/2/x/H2X_radar_e17b.html" title="H2X radar">H2X radar</a> (so no use of the Norton bomb sight for those bombers). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:55, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Like I said, it seems Zezima condenses this in a way that might not be entirely clear, but all I see from your argument is a focus on the small points in an effort to remove a damning description of the bombings brutality. Perhaps the description he leaves us with would help you better understand why this is such a sour issue outside of the, I imagine, the UK or US.

<p>Now that this page has been refactored, you can clearly see that I am not saying that none of the waves of bombers used the stadium, but that most did not, etc. This is an encyclopaedia we should not be including quotes from sources which do not fulfil WP:V. Because he is not an historian he is not citing his sources, and because some of what he says is wrong clearly wrong, we (nor most of the people reading the page) are not in a position to be able to tell which other parts are true and which parts are false. For this reason he should not be used as a source. This is very different from the Friedrich statements because he is an acknowledged historian who holds a minority (revisionist) point of view, but one that has been acknowledged as a point of view by professional historians, which range partial from agreement with him, through to the usual repudiation that happens in academic disputes. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I feel if we argue that it was a "crime" along the lines of "indiscriminate human suffering", we must demonstrate precisely why, other than the simple Genocidewatch quote. Your account is so concerned with technics and time scales that it sounds like we're in a science lab or examining a terrorist mail-order. That is precise, but it does little as far as document the experience. I have come across some first-hand accounts but Zezima does what we need this particle point to do, tie the impact of the bombing back to its logistics, thereby commenting on both (perhaps simplified as Zezima's) simultaneously.--72.92.110.194 04:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p>The paragraph is not just simplified, there are parts of it which wrong. This is not a source which can be trusted. If it can not be trusted, then it is impossible to know which parts are true and which parts are not. For example "over 2000 British Lancasters and American Flying Fortresses dropped loads of gasoline bombs every 50 square yards out from this marker" is false history. What is the source for this statement "Seventy percent of the Dresden dead either suffocated or died from poison gases that turned their bodies green and red." what is the source for this "The intense heat melted some bodies into the pavement like bubblegum, or shrunk them into three-foot long charred carcasses. Clean-up crews wore rubber boots to wade through the "human soup" found in nearby caves." what is the source for this "other cases, the superheated air propelled victims skyward only to come down in tiny pieces as far as fifteen miles outside Dresden."? Further if I look through the article</p>
<ul>
<li>"England's Bomber Command" It was not England's Bomber command.</li>
<li>"635,000 dead German civilians." Source for this number? No range given!</li>
<li>"Day or night, the great number of shells falling where they were not aimed easily debunked the myth of precision" They were not shells.</li>
<li>"As a result, the city's population swelled from its usual 600,000 to at least one million." what is his source for this number?</li>
<li>"An internal Royal Air Force memo described the anti-communist plans as such" How does he know that it was an anti-communist it is open to several interpretations and to most aircrews at the time Uncle Joe was a friend (remember just a few months later most of them would vote for a labour government)</li>
<li>"Beside the stream of refugees, Dresden was also known for its china and its Baroque and Rococo architecture. Its galleries housed works by Vermeer, Rembrandt, Rubens, and Botticelli." This could have come from Gobbles himself. There is no NPOV that the city was also a manufacturing centre for arms and materiel, a railway hub, and a regional command centre.</li>
<li>"The Allied firebombing did more than shock and awe. The bombing campaign murdered more than 100,000 people-mostly civilians-but the exact number may never be known due to the high number of refugees in the area." Claims of over 100,000 dead put this reference into the David Irving and Gobbles camp.

In any case - and getting to the point - I have removed Z's commentary, only because I feel that you have provided an adequate explanation of your objections and yes, I also have a problem with some of the other claims he makes in his article. However, I was willing to look past this because his description of the "first-hand account" at Dresden, with all its descriptive language, is actually akin to what survivors have reported.

At Nuremberg, the Allies simply created the charges as they pleased. Regardless as to whether this was justified, the status of present law did not seem to matter. In the West we have this notion of the finality of the court, so stating that "no law" (by means of technicality) "was in effect" gives the point more merit then the victors gave technicalities that should have served as counterarguements (i.e. not signing the Geneva agreement).--72.92.110.194 03:33, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p>We are not talking about the status of current law, we are talking about the status of positive international law governing the conduct of aerial bombardment during World War II and specifically in 1945 over Dresden. I am not sure of the point you are making about not signing the Geneva agreement, what agreement are you talking? As I have already pointed out the only Geneva convention which would have impacted on aerial warfare was the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_%281929%29_cadc.html" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">Geneva Convention (1929)</a> [BTW see who created that article and is the main contributer to date&#160;:-)] which governed the treatment of downed aircrews as POWs. I don't see what the Allies did or did not do at Nuremberg is an argument against stating that in 1945 there was no positive international law governing the conduct of aerial bombardment. Two verifiable reliable sources have been given to support the sentence. It is not a technicality it is a fact which a Japanese court that found against the United States conduct of aerial bombardment mentioned as a relevant piece of information. Just before the section we have a section with a number of none experts mentioning that they think that the Bombing of Dresden was a war crime. I think that mentioning that positive international law governing the conduct of aerial bombardment during World War II, is a relevant fact that people who read this page are entitled to read.--<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I mentioned Nuremberg because it was an interpretation of "World War II law" and demonstrated arbitrary designation over what was "legal" and not. AS for Geneva, I was referring to the decision that even if Geneva was a legal code signed only by certain parties, it was decided, without legal basis, that those who waged war in a conflict that involved these parties was also subject to Geneva's guidelines, even if they did not explicitly take part in the agreement. The allies are, from a certain point of view, notorious for this same sort of "interpretting" at nuremberg.

<p>Yes, we live in a word where the Allies won the war, so yes the basis of much of the development of international law after World War II is based upon the United Nations and its subsidiaries, and the United Nations were the Allies of World War II. However that has nothing to do with that fact that before and during world war II there was no Positive International Humanitarian Law about aerial bombardment. As I said before I have given two sources one of them is Shimoda. BTW at Nuremberg when Doenitz was on trial for unrestricted submarine warfare it was for the breaches in positive international law that he was found guilty. So that Goering was not tried of strategic aerial bombardment while waging a war of aggression, it was probably because there was no positive international law on aerial bombardment. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 01:49, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also in this case the Draft Amsterdam Convention of 1938 it was not a Draft Hague Convention. "<i>the Hague Conventions was not altered until after World War II</i>".

<dd>War is a nasty brutish business with a logic all of its own. You have rejected my suggestion that we alter the text to look at the moral issues. Instead the article is constructed on a narrow legal issue of was it a war crime. Killing the refugees was never the intention of the western Allies, because live refugees from the fronts (and those made so by reducing their homes to rubble) used up more enemy resource than dead ones. It is a complete reversal the the humanitarian argument: "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.", but it does have a brutal logic, which was the British thought within the laws of war. It is the same logic that says treat you prisoners of war well, not just because the Geneva Conventions bind the state to do so, or because it is the humanitarian thing to do, but because a POW is no longer an enemy combatant and encouraging them to surrender, rather than forcing them to fight to the death, is a better strategy because it allows the enemy to be defeated faster with fewer friendly casualties. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 18:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to the second one the RAF had decided long before, from analysis of the damage to British cities during the Blitz that dehousing people was a more effective way of damaging war production than killing people or attempting to destroy the factories. (I can give you a cited reference to this if you are interested). So if the reference is just to establish that <b>civilian property</b> was the target of the RAF, I am not sure one is needed as I don't think that it is contentious. But if it also is implying that the USAAF was also targeting civilian property in Dresden, that is contentious and should have a specific reference.</p>
<p>Who are the supports who claim that targeting civilian property in World War II was always war crime? Or who has claimed that it was in the case of Dresden?</p>

I merely refactored it into my reconstructed intro. <s>Ulterior motives means out of Cold War considerations (getting the Soviets to Berlin first) or the wish to reduce Germany to an agrarian nation, escalation of the Anglo-German rivalry etc. etc. etc.</s> I have included an explanation of the term <i>ulterior motives</i> but I have reworded the intro anyway. Essentially what the opening paragraph serves as is an overview of what the rest of the se3ction will cover. It became a matter of one or two word descriptions and <s>ulterior (i.e. hidden or not revealed) certainly seems to apply. In other words, the argument used to pardon the bombing (in case against) may look nice in a historical perspective - but are these "justifications" actually considerations that were made before the attack? They soften up the destruction with the idea that somehow it was Dresden's fault for somewhat locally producing shields and gun sights, Dresden's fault for not understanding that the Wehrmacht might use the city in its defense plans, and who could forget, the Gauleiteer for not preparing those who flocked into the city.</s></font></dd>

<p>It whether I deny or affirm that the "The governments of the former Allies have consistently defended their actions in Dresden." As I said before (higher up this page) I am not aware of any Allied government defence of the attacks apart from those put forward in the 1940s. That is not to say that one or more may have (although I seriously doubt that the Soviet Union did), it is just to say that I have no knowledge of such and that I would like a verifiable source for the claim. BTW One possible way of finding a recent British defence would be to look for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Her_Majesty%27s_Government_76b7.html" title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG's</a> advice to Betty on issuing an apology, and any corresponding House of Commons statement on that advice.

<dd><font color="#800000">There is no way that I can give you "Civilian property". That is absolutely absurd. Targetted property? This is not why anyone argues that Dresden is a war crime, aside from the cultural significance angle. I think it has more to do with people melting and choaking in the throes of an agonizing death. The city became a giant inferno. I think you tend to forget this when you get locked away in a discussion about whether the Hague used this word or that word, or other technicalities that I imagine matter very little in the midst of the "raid". <i>It probably [would] lead to a loss of life far in excess of that justified by military necessity</i></font></dd>

Secondly, part of the argument in the "war crimes" section is that there <i>wasn't any</i> "military necessity"...its February 1945 for crying out loud! Also, I do not think that the open cities comment adds anything in particular, other than the suggestion that its Germany's fault for not doing this to "save" Dresden. Why Lysy was unable to see this obvious problem in trying to sort out something we can agree to, I have no idea. Your tone is so casual and nonchalant, as if we were talking about eating krimpets or something. Remember, purpose of this section is to give a <i>convincing</i> argument as to why this is a "war crime"...but I think this whole process is contradictory to all logic, because your disposition regarding the bombing is painfully obvious.

<p>The British and Americans targeted property they could not target civilians from the hight they were bombing and the ordinance they were carrying (even if they had wanted too).</p>
<p>Of course there was military necessity. The Dresden raid was primarily a interdiction strike at the railways to help the Soviets. The last battles of the war were yet to be fought on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28WWII%29_3ca1.html" title="Eastern Front (WWII)">Eastern Front</a> and a lot of Allied soldiers on both fronts were going to die assaulting the German home land. The estimates Allied casualties on the Eastern Front during the last months of the war some, before the Dresden raids but many after are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Budapest Offensive (October 1944-February 1945): 320,082 casualties</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/s/Vistula-Oder_Offensive_5473.html" title="Vistula-Oder Offensive">Vistula-Oder Offensive</a> (January-February 1945): 194,191 casualties</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussian_ea3e.html" title="East Prussian">East Prussian</a> Offensive (January-April 1945): 584,778 casualties</li>
<li>Vienna Offensive (March-April 1945): 177,745 casualties</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Offensive_f5bb.html" title="Berlin Offensive">Berlin Offensive</a> (April-May 1945): 361,367 casualties</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague_Offensive_1c0d.html" title="Prague Offensive">Prague Offensive</a> (May 1945): 52,498 casualties (for sources see <a href="../../../p/r/a/Talk%7EPrague_Offensive_bbdd.html" title="Talk:Prague Offensive">Talk:Prague Offensive</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the the two offensives after the air raids for which Dresden was potentialy a rail conduit were the last two, for which the Allies suffered over 400,000 casualties.</p>
<p>The major difference between was it or was it not a war crime, and also the moral question, depends on whether the force and tactics used were in excess of military necessity. (BTW thanks you have just prompted me to write a wikipedia article on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_necessity.html" title="Military necessity">military necessity</a>).</p>
<p>For the open city question, please read what I have written carefully. I have not suggested that the Germans needed to declare the city an open city. I have said that given that such a concept was used by both sides in the war (Paris 1940, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a> are two more examples, but they were not declared open because of their cultural significance) the Allies should have taken into consideration the importance of Dresden as a cultural centre when initially contemplating its destruction.

<dd><font color="#800000">Military <i>necessity</i> is a matter of opinion. Put it this way: the conditions existed for which the allies could <i>say</i> there was a military necessity. There certainly was a military situation, but that says little about the necessity of an attack on a beleaguered and largely defeated force that, from an Allied point of view, may or may not have considered integrated Dresden into the defense. The point is the war was clearly decided.

<p>It is precisely because "military necessity" is a matter of opinion that there is the controversy there is. One lot believe that destruction of Dresden was really necessary, and it is unfortunate that so many people died. While the other lot says the military benefits disproportionately small for the destruction, pain and suffering it caused. The open city question is not that the German authorities should or should not have made the city open one (because the Nazis were not gentlemen), but that many German civilians thought that there was a gentleman's agreement over it, and people who argue today that it was a culturally significant city are expressing a similar view in they think that the allies should have considered that when they were planning the raids.</p>

Lets keep the opening paragraph as simple as possible and just introduce the main ideas we will then cover in depth later. You're introduction suggests that there was a military necessity and the question of whether or not it was worth the suffering surfaces. A valid point. However, it could also be argued that there was no military "necessity" as I explained above. Your introduction does not acknowledge this view, and I think this view offers a much stronger addition to the introduction. Keep in mind that both ideas are covered in the arguments that follow much later in the section, but I think "lack of a military necessity" is just as much a part of the argument as is "disproportional to military necessity".

<p><font color="#800000">I also forward the idea that the first-hand accounts are valid to be introduced as evidence of a "war crime". As Genocide Watch's President, Mickey Z and Jenkins point out its inhumanity as their primary reason for the "war crime" position, this simply supports it. Another reason would be that one of the things Shimoda took into account was the sheer suffering which this clearly documents. You made a good point when you broke the arguments in two, and unintentionally explain why this is so. You write: <i>While the other lot says the military benefits disproportionately small for the destruction, pain and suffering it caused.</i> There are two ways this can be examined in a favorable "war crime" context. You could aim to show that the military benefits were small (or, as mentioned above, even nonexistant - i.e. lack of military necessity) or that the pain and the suffering was great. The latter begs the question "how great?" Well, you can certainly cite figures and say that x number of people died or you can show <i>how</i> they died, the sort of inhumanity-angle that Shimoda takes into account (essentially, atomic bombs were a more efficient extension of firebombing)</font>--<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESin_cloro_b926.html" title="User:Sin cloro">Sin cloro</a> 17:22, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
