<p>I just wanted to comment here on the idea that Larry Sanger had the idea for Wikipedia. This is not correct. The original idea of using a wiki for the encyclopedia project came to me from Jeremy Rosenfeld, an employee at that time. The encyclopedia project itself was fully conceived by me alone, and I funded it, and I hired Larry to run it -- which he did of course with the Nupedia project.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 18:54, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"However, when the Wikipedia community ruled out advertising as a means of paying for these resources - and in order to reflect the spirit of openness and neutrality central to Wikipedia - it was decided that new arrangements were needed."</p>
<p>This is very POV. The Wikipedia community has never "ruled out" advertising, and this article makes it seem like the reason I went the non profit route and no-advertising is in response to resistance from the community. This is not accurate. I have consistently been opposed to advertising on Wikipedia, although in the early days I thought advertising was going to eventually be necessary. Now I think advertising will never be necessary, but I wonder if someday we (the community) might decide that we could do so much good in the world with a small amount of advertising that we might choose to accept it. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:04, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good point; the idea was merely to explain the events that led to the creation of the WMF - i.e. instead of continuing as a for-profit endeavour. My general understanding was that there was discussion over how best to fund the project, and donations were considered a better route than advertising; I didn't mean to imply that the community rejected a suggestion, but I admit to not considering the possibility of the decision being reversed/altered in the future. I've tweaked the wording slightly, but I wasn't "there", so I could still have it wrong; I'm trying to convey that there were financial as well as "ethical" reasons for Wikipedia not remaining under the ownership of Bomis. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 11:33, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, as I've said to you, this is about documenting the history of <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">Bomis</a> truthfully, follwing the NPOV and not using euphemisms. Due to Wikipedia's affiliation with Bomis, Wikipedians' loyalty to Jimmy Wales, and the press interest in this history, it is easy to violate our most sacred policies when dealing with this topic. I must encourage all contributors to edit these articles with our policies in mind. There are no special exceptions to NPOV.</p>
<p>Bomis makes its money by creating web rings around popular search terms. To label it a web directory is misleading, since a web directory tries to be all-encompassing. Bomis rings, on the other hand, cover categories which people are likely to search for. <a href="http://moe.bomis.com/whatsnew/" class="external autonumber" title="http://moe.bomis.com/whatsnew/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. What other directory considers "Babes" and "Adult" 2 out of 6 core categories, with the others being "Entertainment", "Sports", "Science fiction" and "Other"? It is quite simple. There's no money in creating a science/education webring, because these terms are not frequently searched for. Google for <a href="http://www.google.de/search?le=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site%3Abomis.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;num=20&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de-DE:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?le=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site%3Abomis.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;num=20&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de-DE:official" rel="nofollow">pages on Bomis.com</a> and the first ones you will find are porn-related. Again, maintaining NPOV and being truthful requires us to be truthful about what Bomis' business models is and how it operates.</p>
<p>A term like <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamour_photography.html" title="Glamour photography">glamour photography</a> is primarily used in the industry that produces the photos and not by the consumers. Using it in this article to refer to Bomis Premium content can be considered a <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a>, particularly when the photos on Bomis Premium (naked models with shaved pubic hair and spread legs, sometimes posing with sex toys) fall on the extreme end of that spectrum. Again, it seems likely that the term is used here only to obscure the facts, and hence in violation of NPOV. More precise language, such as "softporn", seems to be more accurate and neutral.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:54, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not see it as a matter of "guilt" or "innocence", and I see nothing wrong with what Bomis did and does in any case. The point is, we are not stating that the models were using sex toys, we are stating that they posed with them. You <i>explicitly</i> stated that they never were using the toys. We don't have any hard source for that, since you haven't reviewed all the content on Bomis Premium. Hence, this should not be explicitly stated without a source. As for "it's all just for show", that distinction is irrelevant, unless you want to say "never used them for pleasure", which is probably true for most sex toy porn.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a>* 00:03, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be turning this into some kind of moral argument. As I said, I have no moral objections to Bomis (other than that I consider much of what they create to be effectively search engine spam). We are, however, trying to neutrally and factually document the company, and it is a fact that Bomis focuses on collecting URLs related to popular search terms, and that in doing so, focuses primarily on pornography and celebrities. These facts should be stated in the article.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:11, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still think glamour photography is too much of a euphemism to be neutral. Pornography, if you read the article, is not defined as being strictly inclusive of sexual acts such as penetration, and common terms like "softporn" and "hardcore pornography" exist to distinguish different categories of erotic content.

<dd>Maybe it should, maybe it shouldn't, the fact is that common definitions are not based on whether it includes sexual acts or not, but based on whether it is intended to be sexually arousing; <i>qualifiers</i> such as "fetish", "softcore", "hardcore" and "bondage" are added to describe different types of pornography.

<p>Eloquence, you say you "see nothing wrong" with what Bomis did, but your edit implies otherwise. The webrings include singers, etc., "<i>but also</i>" webrings related to pornography. To my mind, the "but" suggests a POV of "Bomis has some legitimate and worthwhile content, but also some despicable filth." Judging from the foregoing conversation on this page, it seems like it should be possible to formulate a more neutral description using material from both versions of the passage. Bomis is similar to dmoz, etc., but it isn't comprehensive; it's a commercial service so it emphasizes the most popular search terms; these include various celebrities, sports, and sexually oriented content; etc. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:54, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "but" was not meant to imply any moral judgment, feel free to try to find a more neutral wording. Bomis is not <i>similar</i> to DMOZ, it uses DMOZ content for its directory component directly (like Wikipedia mirrors use Wikipedia content, putting ads on them). Its search ring component is original to Bomis, and focuses on popular terms, with the most frequently updated categories being "Adult", "Babes" and "Entertainment". This is certainly different from typical comercial search engines; Bomis appears to be primarily targeting people coming _from_ search engines, using popular keywords, ending up on a Bomis webring and directory page, and seeing the ads. However, that is a hypothesis; the fact is that it builds rings around popular terms.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 07:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have for now avoided the controversy by using neither term; this should probably not stay this way.

In my opinion, this can fall under both definitions, and I tend to believe that "soft porn" is more commonly and internationally understood. However, glamour also is a fairly widely used term, so I'd be happy to use both.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 08:28, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just submitting my own suggested compromise and got an edit conflict. The normal approach to disputes of this kind ("normal" meaning the cases that don't involve Wikipedia's founder) is that we don't try to decide which view is correct. Opinions on contentious issues are reported, attributed to named sources, with citations. I suggest that we follow that model and avoid trying to adjudicate the merits. How about this language for the article:

<dd>(If this wording is accepted we should clean up the mix of reference styles.) <i>XBiz</i>, which I've cited as a source for the "pornography" description, seems from its website to be a substantial operation that qualifies as a prominent spokesperson. If Jimbo or another prominent spokesperson has somewhere endorsed the "glamour photography" description, we could cite that, but as I'm unaware of such a reference, I've simply noted that he disagrees about calling it porn. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:51, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're a bit confused; nobody has ever disputed that the Bomis webrings compile links to hardcore pornography, among other things. It's the classification of the photographs on <i>Bomis Premium</i> which is in dispute.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 10:07, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>XBiz</i> article is a source for saying that Jimbo disputed the characterization of some part of the Bomis site as "pornography". Would it be reasonable to interpret his statement as applying to or at least including Bomis Premium? I'd just like to get away from wording like your suggested "The material could be described as ...." If it has been so described, let's cite a source. If it hasn't been, we generally wouldn't mention the mere possibility. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 11:06, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo is very strongly opposed to any use of the term "pornography" in connection with Bomis Premium, whether it is described as "softporn" or not; he feels <i>pornography</i> is a generally pejorative term. I do believe he is biased, but he seems to be OK with "erotic photography", so that sounds like a reasonable compromise to me, to avoid going into much more detail on this particular topic than necessary.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 12:24, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My inclination is to say that Jimbo shouldn't get any special privileges. On the other hand, we have to guard against the temptation to be unduly harsh toward him, just to show how independent we are ("look at how virtuous I am, I'm not afraid to defy even the Benevolent Dictator in my noble pursuit of Truth"). Trying to steer between those two errors, I look at this situation and say that, as a general rule, if the article subject (or someone closely connected with the subject) is very strongly opposed to any use of a particular term, yet the term is used widely enough to be notable, then our normal approach would be to report the use by others, report the subject's strong opposition, and give any appropriate elaboration of each side's position. (For example, we could mention something like Jimbo's analogy to R-rated movies.)</dd>

<dd>If Jimbo wants to pull rank and say that this is his project and the p-word can't appear in the Bomis article, even as an attributed opinion, then so be it. I certainly wouldn't quit Wikipedia as a result. Generally, though, he hasn't pulled rank in situations of that sort. One way to put it is: Does the opposition to the use of the term "pornography" come from one of the principals of Bomis or from the Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 03:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I agree, Jimbo, doesn;t have that kind of right on this page. I think we should eliminate all the overly sexually-explicit material on this page, as I have done so. People don't need to know if the models posed suggestively with bananas or if they have sex toys all over their breasts.</p>

<p>Sometime in early '50s a State-owned company in Poland was established for the purpose of faciliating exchange of machinery, vehicles, spares, tooling, test equipment, raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and basically everything from microelectronics to heavy building and mining machinery between State-owned companies. Its name was <i>Biuro Obrotu Maszynami i Surowcami</i> which may be best translated as <i>Machinery and Raw Materials Exchange</i>. It became known under the acronym BOMIS. In the late '70s it opened a chain of retail stores, also known under the BOMIS brand, that was selling certain items to general public. It was wound up in the early '90s after the Polish economy started switching to open market. At present there are a few companies using BOMIS in their name, all of them private, some are suppliers of new and second-hand machinery, one of them offers training services. For a period of time there was an annual used machinery trade fair in Poznań under the BOMIS name. 11:23 13 Nov 2006 (UTC)</p>
