<dd>It would be interesting to reconstruct who actually was present from each of the parties. Do you think there might be anything available on the meeting in British archives&#160;? I believe each of the teams had to make some reports that, although classified at that time, might be available in the archives today. Not the Polish one though, as they've destroyed everything because of the German invasion (well, some might still be buried somewhere in what then was Romania). Anyway, such notes could reveal what were their impressions after the meeting etc. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> 16:27, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

In July 1978, a year and a half before his death, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marian_Rejewski_7557.html" title="Marian Rejewski">Marian Rejewski</a> told historian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Woytak_bbf6.html" title="Richard Woytak">Richard Woytak</a> about the working meetings at <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyry.html" title="Pyry">Pyry</a>, just south of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>:</p>
<p>"[M]y colleagues [Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski] and I talked with the specialists, the cryptologists. We split things up so that … Zygalski and Różycki … explained things in English, as well as they could — they didn't speak English well, in fact hardly at all — but somehow they managed to make themselves understood. They talked with Knox, and I spoke in French with Braquenié. Since I knew some French, it was only natural … that I would take Braquenié. And [<i>laughing</i>] and since my colleagues knew neither French nor English, it was absolutely all the same whom <i>they</i> took, you see.… Just how much Braquenié understood, I don't know; but there's no question that Knox grasped everything very quickly, almost quick as lightning. It was evident that [the British] really had been working on … Enigma.… So they didn't require many explanations. They were specialists of a different kind — of a different class. Knox. Later Denniston also came by briefly — but as the chief [of the British cryptological organization]. And Bertrand would also come by.…</p>
<p>"[There was another person present.] But it isn't clear just who he was. There is a suspicion it was Menzies [then-Col. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Menzies_598d.html" title="Stewart Menzies">Stewart Menzies</a>, deputy chief of Britain's <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Intelligence_Service_e82b.html" title="Secret Intelligence Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a>, from the end of 1939 the chief]. They said … his name was Sandwich.… But he only came in for a moment — made as if he wasn't even looking, just talked with Denniston [who] happened to be there. [H]e exchanged a few words with him, I don't know what [about]. That … Frenchman Braquenié nudged me with his elbow and said: 'Sandwich — his name is Sandwich.' [<i>Laughing</i>:] And the man left — a moment later he left. It's one of those mysteries. But — Mayer claims it was most certainly Menzies.… Mayer met him [again, after the war]. It's hard [to imagine Mayer] making this up. But, then again, Bertrand claims it wasn't [Menzies], that he knew this Sandwich well, [that] he was a radio expert, or something like that. It's hard to know what to make of this." (In Kozaczuk, <i><a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma</a></i> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, p. 236.)</p>

"[At] the meeting … in July 1939, the first question that … Dillwyn Knox asked was: 'What are the connections in the entry drum?' … Knox's niece, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penelope_Fitzgerald_1fa4.html" title="Penelope Fitzgerald">Penelope Fitzgerald</a>, states in her <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> book, <i>The Knox Brothers</i> … that Knox was furious when he learned how simple it was. [The connections were in alphabetical order.]" (Marian Rejewski, in Kozaczuk, <i><a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma</a></i> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, p. 257.)</p>

<dd>Hm, interesting. Thanks, I should've looked it up myself. Maybe Beesly's <i>"Who Was the Third Man at Pyry?"</i> in Cryptologia is based on some research of the British archives and confirms either version. It would be also interesting to learn what happened with the information gathered by Knox upon his return to Britain. He must have written a report of the meeting i presume (but obviously I don't know what the procedures were, so he may have not as well, or it was destroyed). <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> 08:46, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is generally accepted by serious historians (e.g., see <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kahn_bfb5.html" title="David Kahn">David Kahn</a>'s <i>Seizing the Enigma</i>) that the third Briton at the July 1939 meeting was Commander Humphrey Sandwith (spelled with a "<b>t</b>", not a "c"). You won't find most of the above material in the <i>Polish</i> editions of Kozaczuk's <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> book, which reprint only one of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marian_Rejewski_7557.html" title="Marian Rejewski">Rejewski</a>'s papers and don't contain <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Woytak_bbf6.html" title="Richard Woytak">Woytak</a>'s interview. The same, incidentally, may be said of Kozaczuk's posthumous <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <i>Enigma</i>, except that it doesn't include <i>any</i> of Rejewski's papers and actually perpetuates the Menzies-at-Warsaw myth. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogologist_53bd.html" title="User:Logologist">logologist</a> 10:26, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would think that any decent historical cryptanalyst would take issue with the wording on the caption on the German Army stecker board. The board's configuration added very little additional security (which primarily was thought to come from the changing configuration of the rotors). --enm 19:15, 27 Dec 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, that was not the case, and the caption is correct. Which decent historical cryptanalysts do you have in mind? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
