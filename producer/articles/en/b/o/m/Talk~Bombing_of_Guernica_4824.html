<p>I've translated this from the Spanish-language Wikipedia. The only intentional changes I have made are (1) tightening up some wordings and removing some redundancies, (2) removing a few excessively POV phrases, and (3) clarifying a few references that I imagine will be less clear to an English-speaking audience than to Spanish-speakers.</p>
<p>The article is probably still more POV than is generally acceptable for the English-language Wikipedia, but I leave it to someone else to begin work on that. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 04:40, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Then, after putting about two-and-a-half hours into a translation, I went looking for some relevant English-language external links and came across <a href="http://www.buber.net/Basque/History/guernica-ix.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.buber.net/Basque/History/guernica-ix.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which appears to have most of the same content. It seems very unlikely the Spanish-language wikipedians had permission to use this, and the parallel content goes way beyond fair use.

<p>The page states&#160;:</p>
<p>he also remarks that the official German account of this part of the war, "The War in the North", falsely stated only 7.956 tons of bombs were dropped on Guernica.</p>
<p>That seems just strange as above the tally is 22 tonnes&#160;: are these 8 tonnes (7.956 kg) or what&#160;?</p>

<p>We should mention that Guernica held (and holds) arms factories. I don't know if it should go in the Guernica section or the Motivation one. -- <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 01:37, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>We do say, "Among the few buildings spared were the arms factories of Unceta and Company and Talleres de Guernica". We could expand on that. Clearly, the Condor Legion had no interest in destroying the armaments factories in a town they hoped soon to capture. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 03:47, Sep 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>He doesn't say an arms factory holds Guernica, he says (accurately) that Guernica holds an arms factory ("holds" in the sense of containing, perfectly good English usage). As I pointed out, the specifics are in the article: the arms factories are/were Unceta and Company and Talleres de Guernica. They were specifically <i>not</i> bombed. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:32, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, but actually Guernica don't have any arm factory. That's what I was pointing out. Sorry for my English but it's mainly self-learned. <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdiazabal_2899.html" title="User:Idiazabal">Idiazabal</a> 11:14, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you using "actually" in the English-language sense (meaning "in fact") or as a literal translation of the Spanish <i>"actualmente"</i> (meaning "at the present time")? I personally don't know if there is currently an arms factory in Guernica, but definitely at the time Unceta and Company and Talleres de Guernica were there and were arms factories. I've seen that statement from sources of very varying politics. I want to make sure you follow what the article says on this: this in no way indicates that the parts of Guernica that were bombed were legitimate military targets. The Condor Legion appear to have deliberately <i>avoided</i> hitting these two facilities because Franco's forces intended to capture and use them. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:04, Oct 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Idiazabal is technically wrong but user Error is wrong in the sense of POV. Gernika had one or two short weapons' factories, like many Basque towns (it's a traditional Basque industry). But the factories and the bridge (another self-justfication of fascists for the massacre) were left intact. The German bombers strictly bombed the town center (homes) and left the periphery (industries) intact. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 07:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About the death toll described in this almost <i>negationist</i> version of Cesar Vidal we should notice that at the end Vidal bases his numbers in Salas Larrazabal version, who was himself air fighter pilot and member later of the <i><a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_Azul_e8e3.html" title="Division Azul">Division Azul</a></i>, the little army sent by Franco to help Hitler in Russia. By itself it should be enought to put it under heavy suspicion.</p>
<p>But besides we can compare the death toll in the Durango bombing, which was recounted by the authorities then and resulted in 265 deads plus wounded. While the area of destruction, the amount of exoplosives and air forces was considerably less than in the Guernica opperation, it is totally impossible that the death toll was minor in Guernica than in Durango.</p>
<p>To take Cesar Vidal version, which is a negationist more of the large serie of negationist versions we've known, is not acceptable in my point of viow. In fact, there can be made a complete chapter with the numerous negationist versions and attempts made by different Spanish governments, starting by the Franco regime and ending with Cesar Vidal and Pio Moa. (Oh, the version about the Bilbao firefighters not being enough diligent was also from Franco's air forces official Salas Larrazabal.)

<dd>I would welcome other well-cited descriptions of these obviously controversial events, and I'm more than glad to help with translation and cleanup of Spanish-language texts. I would hope that whoever does this is careful in their citation of source material, and is clear where their version comes from, instead of simply writing a different version into the narrative voice of the article and claiming it as "truth".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Given that Vidal is clearly describing war crimes and deliberate tactics of massacre, I take it that by "negationist" you just mean in terms of death toll? Again, I would truly welcome other cited sources on the death toll; on the other hand I'll admit that I would oppose an uncited "but other sources say...", because it is unverifiable. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:44, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I spoke yet with Blas, buber.net author and Basque descendant himself, about the issue. If you looks in the footnotes there you'll see that Vidal book is totally based in Salas Larrazabal's one, from a book he wrote in 1977 after Franco death. I say negationist in the sense of the large history of negationism that have tried the different Spanish diplomatics, including the 1972 letter in the New York Times. Now obviously they know it is totally impossible to maintain in the old versions: 1.-that the proper Basques burned Guernica, 2.-that it was cause the Bilbao firefighters didn't went, etc. etc. (Although Vidal points anew that of the firefighters.) Then now they follow with the <i>demytification</i> procces, saying that there were no more than 150 deads, which is easily rebatible.</p>
<p>But only a date. Salas Larrazabal was a Francoist official and went to Russia with the Division Azul, the Spanish contribution to Hitler army. Certainly he was a first hand witness, as his testimony is valuable, but while oneself had clear that he was seeing it through a Francoist eyes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cesar Vidal (and his friend Pio Moa) is a member of the Fundation National Francisco Franco, as it was clearly noted in the credits of the web site of the fundation. (Although due to the controversy and protest that the implication of the Spanish Ministery of Culture funding, his names were erased from the credits just at the loose of power of Aznar's party.) But his opinnion tendencies are widely known in Spain.</p>
<p>So, I believe that Salas Larrazabal historical description is valuable, as Von Richtoffen's, but pointing out who he was. And of course the death toll part is just but pure negationism, as can be noted not only with a comparation with the previous bombing of Durango, were in a more limited bombing the officially recounted inmediate death toll was 260 (I had to look the concrete toll, wounded and posterior deaths out,) it was totally impossible that a operation made a crowded market day, with persecution of the people flying out, bombings of little villeges on the surroundings and rural houses, and a total destruction of the ville would resulte in a mere 150 death toll. That's negationism.</p>
<p>Perhapps the best way to correct the article would be to write a chapter dedicated to the multiple negationism attemps made by the Spanish governments and diplomacy, being Vidal's one the last. (Pio Moa is even more radical than his friend Vidal.)</p>

<p>Having read the relevant chapter in Vidal's book when I wrote the relevant passages of this article, he hardly seems "negationist". He describes what is clearly a war crime, emphasizes that the attack was clearly not aimed at the few legitimate military targets in the area, makes a case that the fact that they did <i>not</i> hit the <i>Gernikako Arbolaor</i> or the <i>Casa de Juntas</i> refutes any excuse that the bombing was merely imprecise, and presents but generally rejects the claim that the firefighters from Bilbao were less than diligent. Furthermore, he places the responsibility as lying at least as high up as either von Richthofen and quite likely with Franco himself.</p>
<p>I'd have no problem at all with us citing numerous sources for their estimates of the number of dead, as long as we do it in a style where it doesn't overwhelm the article. The article as it stands does <i>not</i> cite Vidal on the number of casualties. In fact, at the moment there <i>are</i> no citations on the statement about number of casualties. We simply say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimates range from as few as 120 dead to as many as 10,000, with the consensus standing at about 1,500, mostly old people, women, and children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that you are not arguing with either the high or low estimate as existing (citations for these would be an improvement) and that your argument is that the consensus number is too low. The Spartacus site you cite (a generally very excellent site, I've used it a lot: its politics are clearly to the left, but I've found it uniformly scrupulous and scholarly) gives the number of dead as 1,685. That's really rather close to the 1,500 the article currently gives as a consensus. However, it's also suspiciously precise for such an obviously unknowable number, suggesting precision beyond any possible accuracy: anything past the two leading digits of an estimate like this is noise. Your own page says "at least 1,650 people (this figure was given by the Basque government)". Again, this is exactly 10% different than what I say is the consensus number. I have no problem adding the statement that the Basque government said that there were at least 1,650 dead. Do you have a citation on this? The link on your user page leads to a French-language page about World War I, which is of no obvious relevance. (I presume you are right about what the Basque government said, but a citation would still make this stronger; it would be especially useful to know <i>when</i> the Basque government said this.)</p>
<p>Based on what you've given me, and without the benefit of further references, I'd change the article to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimates range from as few as 120 dead to as many as 10,000, with the consensus standing close to the 1,650 that the Basque government of the time gave as the miniumum number of dead. The dead appear to have been mostly old people, women, and children.</p>

<p>The Basque government counted that toll, but with the Basque government there were several people, i.e. George Steer, war correspondent and British agent who wrote a book published in 1938, "The tree of Guernika, a study on modern war".</p>
<p>I have no problem with the great work you've made. Only I explained a little bit about Vidal, Salas Larrazabal and the Spanish negationist efforts. <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdiazabal_2899.html" title="User:Idiazabal">Idiazabal</a> 15:25, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the citation for newly added statement about some historians doubting it was a market day?

<p>A year later: someone is clearly contesting this again in the article, again with only weasel words rather than citation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However there is still debate over this situation. One group argues that there was no market because the Basque government had order markets to stop since it endangered the civilian population and <a href="../../../g/u/d/Gudari.html" title="Gudari">Gudaris</a> to the block the roads. The other group argues that the government had issued the act forbidding markets at a moment when not everyone recieved it on time and still went and that the Gudaris only blocked main roads when the majority of people used rural roads paths. Despite the arguments the compromise decision was that 'it would have been a market day'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that there is no indication of who "one group" and "the other group" are, nor between whom a "compromise decision" has supposedly been made. I believe that if this cannot be cited for, it should be removed. It was added by the same person who removed all casualty estimates over about 300 dead; I have restored the latter. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because this assault on Guernica contradicted General <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilio_Mola_58ce.html" title="Emilio Mola">Emilio Mola</a>'s earlier plans for the pursuit of the war in this region, Vidal argues that von Richthofen must have had either approval from Mola or a direct order from Franco himself. Additionally, by default, the entire Condor Legion force was under direct Franco's command. It is almost impossible that the Germans decided to hit such a target on their own. Most of the views about a 'test-bombing' have been created afterwards mainly by the European press based on discussions on the might of the bomber as an absolute weapon. Besides, the ridiculous claims of Franco that it was the 'reds' that burned Guernica, show that he himself tried to justify this act without ever making any insinuation for the Germans even long after the end of the war in Spain.</p>

<dd>There is no one unique Franquist version. Their estimates at the time of the attack were in the 250-300 range. The low two-digit numbers you allude to merit mention as examples of propaganda, but no more. They are obviously as ridiculous as the straw-man 10,000 you introduced above.

Figure espoused by academic centres and governments." I'm not going to tix the bad grammar and the sentence fragment; I will point out that "espoused by academic centres and governments" without naming a single academic centre or government is a supreme example of weasel wording. I have my doubts, because when someone edits like this (the latest edit that added this also removed the statement that the Nationalists appear to have made no effort to count the victims, which I have now restored) it does not encourage me to believe a word of what they say, and I don't have access to the source in question. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I presume (and correct me if I'm wrong) that this Larrazabal is related to the "Francoist official" Larrazabal who "went to Russia with the Division Azul", alluded to above. If this is true (1) it isn't obvious why we should separate his estimates from others that are characterized as coming from the Francoist side and (2) it certainly seems odd to give him the uncontested last word, supported only by weasely remarks. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:45, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will add: it is possible that all of this is correct. However, the fact that the (presumably one) person who is advocating it is doing so by repeating the same minimal things over and over and saying nasty things about the other editors, myself included. This is no way to make a case for anything. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:53, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This has still not been properly sorted out, partly because the anonymous editor appears to prefer a slow edit war to responding, and when he does respond does little but rant. Right now, the article says "The most recent study, made by several academics, have estimated the deaths between 250 and 300. Figure espoused by academic centres and governments.(Larrazabal.2005)", which is to say the citation is 'Jesus Larrazabal, "El Bombardeo de Guernica", <i>El Mundo</i>, volume 12, October 2005' an incredibly vague citation (citing to a daily newspaper, but giving only the <i>month</i> of publication). The date of the actual study is not given, nor any indication of where it might have been published (an academic journal? just a newspaper?). "Figure espoused by academic centres and governments" really doesn't mean a thing since not one of these "academic centres" or "governments" is named, let along cited for. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:14, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This would be in accordance with the native name (Basque) and the official name, which is <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gernika.html" title="Gernika">Gernika</a>. "Guernica" is a Spanish spelling and it's only adequate in the case of the "Guernica" artwork of Picasso, that has it as official name. It could be arguably justified when speaking in Spanish but even in that language, the native spelling of Basque toponyms (specially when they are official, as it is the case) is gaining ground systematically.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Basque_5885.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Basque">Basque Wkiproject</a> we will soon discuss general guidelines for standarization. But so far, as I understand it, the policy is: (1) English name when available (example: <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscay.html" title="Biscay">Biscay</a>), (2) official name when it exists (example: <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitoria-Gasteiz_a96c.html" title="Vitoria-Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a>), (3) native local name when the other two don't apply. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 08:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is a case where there is a well-known name in English that trumps local usage. It probably doesn't with reference to the town, but it does with reference to the bombing. I'd venture that most educated native English speakers if they just see the word "Guernica" will think of the bombing (or the Picasso painting). "Gernika" is more likely to conjure the town itself (although fewer people will recognize it at all). But as long as there is a redirect either way, it is probably not a big deal. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Picasso's painting has that name: "Guernica" but the town has a different official spelling. For example it's been seen in Basque the claim "Guernica Gernikara" meaning the Guernica to Gernika (asking Picasso's painting to be in the Gernika Biltzar House, instead of Madrid). I think the Spanish spelling should be kept for the painting but not here, as it is contradictory with geographical names used elsewhere in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>The painting is after all, a powerful symbol but also an anecdote.</dd>

<p>It is advisable to reflect upon the following: "<i>Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature</i>" (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, see also <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)</a> <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)</a>).</p>
<p>If the name Gernika is or becomes more common or accepted than Guernica regarding the present city then the name of that article probably needs to be changed. (A related issue might also be whether the province is called <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscay.html" title="Biscay">Biscay</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/z/Bizkaia.html" title="Bizkaia">Bizkaia</a>?) However, regarding the bombing of Guernica (and the painting which was inspired by that historical event) the historic spelling is at the present time the most appropriate in my opinion (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28events%29_ca3d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (events)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (events)</a>). --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 21:38, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As has been pointed out several times, size is just not relevant.

<dd>Size matters, naturally, specially when all most English-speakers know about Gerniak is Picasso's painting.

Remember that English is not anymore just an ethnic language but the international language of the World and Gernikans have so much right as Londoners to say what they think on how their town's name should be spelled and pronounced (correctly). After all, they are the vast majority of English-speaker who know something real about Gernika.

<p>Sugaar, you have your point of view. I am mainly concerned with upholding Wikipedia policies; evidently you are not. Frankly you are not the the person to advise anyone to "listen" to others <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 02:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Contrary to the current status, I have no objection to the article about the town of Gernika-Lumo going under that name since that is indeed its name and that would be the name I would look for if I ever wished to visit it. But the historical event of the town's bombing has consistently gone by the name of the 'Bombing of Guernica' in the English speaking world for nearly seventy years. That event is very well known as a prelude to the later urban bombings of the Second World War -- which was why I was looking for the article under that name -- but until today I had never heard of a 'Bombing of Gernika' and wouldn't have recognized what it referred to. Ever since George Steer's London Times article, "The Tragedy in Guernica", written 27 April 1937 (the day after the event) the bombing has always been associated with the Spanish form of the name. Since the town's bombing is of much greater significance and is much better known than the town itself I would suggest the title of this article about that bombing revert to the customary 'Bombing of Guernica', even though that's not the official name of the town.

<dd><i>Fascist</i> is a poor choice for a neutral term, especially at this early date, because many on that side were not fascists. We've been through this argument in a lot of articles. Writing on my own, not for Wikipedia, I might deploy this word rhetorically, but it is definitely a POV word in this context. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree strongly. The term fascist was then specially used for the Italian version of it but has since then become a catch-all term for all simmilar political movements, specially those of the same period and geographical area. The regime that was deposed by Hitler in Austria in 1938 was fascist (not nazi though) and the same is said of many other European regimes copied from the Mussolinian model.</dd>
<dd>In fact, the term was alreay used by many people in that period that found the need to describe all those simmilar regimes under a single term. Fascism and fascist have been the term of choice of most historians and other people since then and has only been aregued against by nitty-picky apologists of Francoism and some equally nitty-picky fascists that like to emphasize the little differences between those so simmilar movements.</dd>
<dd>Constitutive of the Spanish fascism (National Movement, as was called later) were Falangists (closest to original fascism, few but very militant), right-wing Carlists (only in Navarre actually, fused with Falange in FET-JONS) and the bulk: conservatives that moved en masse to this fascist idelogy when it was constituted. A former conservative that supports a fascist regime and is affiliated to a fascist party cannot be considered anymore just a conservative, as this term implies somehow being in favor of democracy. So the real choice is between using generalistic fascism or using a more specifict term like (self-given) national-catholicism (which emphasizes the main diffeence between Fracoist regime and other more laicist fascist regimes: Christian fundamentalism). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 14:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was me. I was just changing redirects when I saw that and realized it was wrong:</dd>
<dd>There's no "Mundaka river": the firth/estuary of Mundaka or Gernika is that: an estuary, not any freshwater river. Probably the original editor was Spanish speaker and confused terms, as river and firth are very simmilar in Spanish (<i>río</i> and <i>ría</i>). Maybe even the source used "río" (river) instead of "ría" (estuary).</dd>
<dd>The river Oka does exist but is a short river that is part of the Urdaibai basin. Neither the estuary (Mundaka/Gernika estuary) nor the river (Oka river) have an entry in Wikipedia, but Urdaibai (a biosphere reserve) has. That's why I made the change that way.</dd>
<dd>I thought to keep both names but found it really not helpful. To avoid disputes between Mundaka and Gernika for the name, the estuary and the whole basin is often called Urdaibai ("boars' river" probably), and that's the oficial name of the reserve.</dd>
<dd>You monitor everything, really.</dd>
<dd>Now that you know the reasons, correct it as you wish, but, please, do not wirte again "Mundaka river" becuase that's a factual inaccuracy. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 05:21, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Naah, I don't monitor everything, but I monitor a lot; I figure that one of the best things I can do here is to make sure that unexplained changes to articles are improvements rather than liabilities; it's amazing how many are the latter. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:33, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought I corrected the spelling but maybe I missed some items. The idea is that official name of <i>Gernika</i> is used for the town and <i>Guernica</i> is reserved for Picasso's picture as happens for instance in Basque and (often) in Spanish. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 04:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to rebut the distortion that Sugaar is perpetuating, both here and on user talk pages that there is a "consensus" for "Bombing of Gernika". A look at the page history, the discussion above and at <a href="../../../g/u/e/Talk%7EGuernica_9c52.html" title="Talk:Guernica">Talk:Guernica</a> will show that to be absurd. Both articles referred to "Guernica" when they were first created and they stayed that way for many months, until a few Basque nationalists got on the case and unilaterally moved them, against <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUse_common_names_4093.html" title="WP:Use common names">WP:Use common names</a>. This article was not on my watchlist, so I didn't notice the move at the time. Clearly several other editors have also objected to the move since it was made. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, I have several Spanish (not Basque) maps in my possession, and they all show the name of the town as Gernika. As does Google Maps... <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuota_b8dd.html" title="User:Quota">quota</a> 12:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about a "compromise"?</dd>
<dd>1) Keep <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Guernica_0bfe.html" title="Bombing of Guernica">Bombing of Guernica</a> - During WWII there were hundreds of newspaper articles about Guernica, and subsequently many historical documents have used this name. All of our references use the Guernica spelling.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Keep <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernica_%28painting%29.html" title="Guernica (painting)">Guernica (painting)</a> for similar reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Keep <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gernika-Lumo_0985.html" title="Gernika-Lumo">Gernika-Lumo</a> - Seems like in the past few years the residents of the town have decided on this name for political reasons. That's fine... we all accept "Istanbul" and "New York". Also there are references that support this. However as a concession to usability and in consideration of the unique historical status of the town I recommend that we keep the alternate Guernica spelling and pronunciation available in the lead of that article so people less familiar with the topic know that we are talking about the same town. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHaber_f4d1.html" title="User:Haber">Haber</a> 13:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>b) Bombing &amp; town should be consistent</dd>

<p>- the question of the town name has been endlessly debated on that page, which is the place for it. I don't think anyone argues that the town should be Guernica but the bombing Gernika (or G-L). So there is really no point on starting this here - it should be at the other page. But I think the issue has been debated enough there.

<dd>I recommend Grant65 remove himself from this debate.

(See his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Grant65#Japanese_War_Crimes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Grant65#Japanese_War_Crimes" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> for other instances of his behavior.) <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadler_77dd.html" title="User:Madler">Madler</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/d/User_talk%7EMadler_a6f9.html" title="User talk:Madler"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Madler_7af3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Madler"><i>contribs</i></a></sub> 16:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my opinion the bombing of the town should be titled under the historical name, much like the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> (the city is now called <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volgograd.html" title="Volgograd">Volgograd</a>) or the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Leningrad_5a77.html" title="Siege of Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a> (the city is present day <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>). If anything the title should be linked to the painting by the same name. Changing the name of the article on the present-day city to Gernika-Lumo sounds reasonable though, but should really be discussed on the talk page for that article. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 16:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Bombing and the Town do not have to be consistent with each other. I hate pointing to WP policies, Johnbod, but I've said about ten times that we should follow our references. Previous contributors have kindly provided them for us. In the case of the bombing, we have 7/7 Guernica. In the case of the modern name, we have the town's official website saying Gernika-Lumo.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion it's <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Gernika_e502.html" title="Bombing of Gernika">Bombing of Gernika</a> (as it refers to the town and not to the painting - so the should be mutually consistent) and obviously <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gernika-Lumo_0985.html" title="Gernika-Lumo">Gernika-Lumo</a>, as it is official, or Gernika, as it is most used. Deciding otherwise is promoting ignorance: while "gwernika" may not be a mispronunciation in English nowadays, it's still far less correct than Gernika, the same that Waterloo (english pron., like in Abba's song) is less correct than Waterloo ("Baterloh"), Dutch pronuciation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here there are some people that seem to prefer to mispronounce Waterloo and Gernika because it fits better their provincial viewpoints (provincial in regard to the reality of these sites) and, while in Waterloo this may only affect the text of the lead section, in the case of Gernika it also affects the very spelling of the title.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And yes, I do agree that Grant could well take a wikibreak and/or dedicate his efforts to more important matters where he surely can make a really good apportation. And not to insist in promoting ignorance in what should be a platform of culture.</dd>

<dd>Me too. And against cultural elitism of all kinds.

<dl>
<dd>In addition, not only is Grant65 right on this issue (this is an English-language encyclopedia, not a Basque-language one, and the English form is "Guernica," period), but Sugaar's characterization of his efforts on the issue ("promoting ignorance") violates both <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 18:27, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another point: Sugaar's statement, "Chosing 'Gernika' is being serious and informative," contradicts <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENaming_7f45.html" title="WP:Naming">WP:Naming</a>, particularly this nutshell summary at the top of that page: <i>Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.</i> The form that "the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize" is unquestionably <i>Guernica</i>, and that is the name that should be used. <i>Gernika</i> is unrecognizable to the great majority of English speakers (I'm reasonably well-educated, and I'd never heard of it until today), and its use tends to obscure rather than to inform. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 20:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the interested reader I am sure that Pokemon is just as important as any other topic. I did a little research and Britannica titles the article "Guernica" and refers to the city as "Guernica y Luno".<a href="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=Guernica&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=Guernica&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Encarta does the same.<a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=Guernica" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=Guernica" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> However, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia unlike any other, we have one article on the city, one on the painting and this one on the bombing. But renaming this article because of a later change in the name of the town feels like <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism_%28negationism%29.html" title="Historical revisionism (negationism)">historical revisionism</a>. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 10:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If it means anything to Sugaar, and I'm not sure that it will, I always use the "local names" setting on the Encarta CD-ROM atlas. In personal writings/correspondence, I use indigenous spellings when I am made aware of them. I sympathise with your argument but also feel that Wikipedia policy is logical and sensible in this case. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 05:13, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article currently says "Even before the bombardment, Guernica was a place of great significance to the Basque people, which is the reason why Franco ordered its destruction." I see no attribution for this claim of motivation. Franco had only limited control over the Condor Legion. It is somewhat controversial whether he even knew in advance about the attack; assuming that he did know about it, it is controversial whether he ordered the attack or merely acquiesced; it is very questionable whether anyone knew in advance how destructive the attack—the first ever with these particular tactics—would be. If he was consciously intending the attack as a propaganda act of this sort, it seems a bit odd that the Nationalists did their best to <i>suppress</i> accurate reports of what they'd done. This claim to know the answers to all of this, plus his motivation, appears to be based on nothing. So I am removing this. If someone can find a reasonably reliable source that attributes this motivation then cite it and let's mention it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
