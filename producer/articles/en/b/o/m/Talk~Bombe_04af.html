<p>A good start to this page. There are some problems, however. From memory then,</p>
<p>1). The bombe (in any Polish, British, US variation and whatever the spelling) was not a computing device in any signficant sense. No programmable operation, no decision elements (ie, branching on a condition), etc. It (they) were essentially reverse Enigma machines (in multiples per bombe), and served only to test possible keys (ie ground settings plus whatever message key (ie session key in modern terms) might be used. Saved much time and very valuable and so on, but not computing devices.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there was STOP condition there. But even if not computing in the "calculation" sense, definitely it was an information processing device (input-&gt;processing-&gt;output)&#160;?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well... Depends on your definition, of course. But by a sufficiently broad definition my cat is a computer when she decides there's not enough of her favorite food and protests. The general definition is now programability, memory, branching capability, and so on. See the article on the Colossus and its Talk page for some discussion on this point. Likewise, some of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing_hardware.html" title="History of computing hardware">history of computing hardware</a> articles. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 14:15, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2). The first widget used by the Polish BS was called 'cyclometer'. It became unusable as the Germans changed their procedures from '32 on and was replaced by the first bomba (s).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cyclometer was useful until September 15th 1938, when German coding procedures were changed. It had to be replaced by "perforated sheets" and bombas.</dd>

<dd>I believe the <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclometer.html" title="Cyclometer">cyclometer</a> was used only to generate the catalog of cycle characteristics corresponding to various rotor orders and positions. This catalog was then the tool which was used to break Enigma settings. The reason it was replaced was that, rather than using a common, global ground setting to encrypt the indicator, the operator chose his own setting at random, and sent it in the clear, along with the encrypted indicator. I'll try and work on this article soon. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 02:47, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3). When the German Army went from 3 possible rotors in some specified order to 3 out of 5 rotors in some specified order, the increased problem faced by the Poles was not a theoretical one, it was a practical engineering one. The bombas they had would take too long against the increased possibilites (the 3 of 5 rotors) and new bombas which would take a practical time would be far more complex and take too long to design and build then they thought they had either time or money to handle. Hence, much of the reason for the handoff to the British and French in mid '39.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the Poles preferred the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perforated_sheet.html" title="Perforated sheet">perforated sheets</a> to the bomby, especially when the number of plugboard connections were increased. But yes, they didn't have the resources to make 60 (instead of 6). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 02:47, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>4). Bomba/bombe/bomb (s) continued to be used against Enigma traffic till the end of the War. They were not made obsolete by the acquisition of an Enigma plus auxiliary material from any source, including a U-boat.</p>
<p>5). The problem confronted by Turing et al in Hut 6 at BP had been different in kind and difficulty from the start. Naval Enigma had, since the Navy adopted the Army modifications to commercial Enigma in ('32?) (replacing their own version adopted in ('28?)) always used 3 of 5 rotors, and furthermore had always used a much more complex and harder to analyze method of setting session keys. In short, their "key scheduling" was much better than the Army/Luftwaffe/SD etc. Seizures of material (from U-boats in various places, from the <i>Krebs</i> in the Loftein Islands (sorry about the spelling if it's wrong), from the weather trawlers off the coast of Iceland, etc were helpful in getting past that key scheduling. Though they only got through it intermittently, and were blacked out for long periods.</p>
<p>6). On the 'political' side, it was apparently, the determination of the USA and USN to build their own bombes that finally compelled BP/Secret Service to allow US participation in the Enigma operation; full information on techniques and allowing US personnel to assist and so on. In fact, both the USA and USN eventually built ambitious (and much faster) bombe variations (very large physically and so fast there were serious brush making contact reliability problems with them) bombes. Some were made in Dayton at NCR.</p>

<p>Reason: Rejewski's recovery of the wiring of rotors I, II and III was based on the doubled indicator system with a common ground setting, in use by the German Army and Air Force until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">15 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> and the Navy until <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>; after that, his original attack couldn't be applied.

<p>I removed the following:</p>
<blockquote style="background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;">
<p>A cryptological bombe is essentially a large number of cypher machines in parallel, each decyphering a given message using different keys. By using dozens or hundreds of machines at once, prospective keys can be attempted in bulk, and the product from each of the decipherments can be screened for plaintext phrases which would indicate that the correct key was used. The British were concerned with the radio traffic of the German Navy, who used relatively strict procedures for encryption; the technique of loooking for a repeated three-letter wheel setting would not work (as it did for the Army Enigma), and naval Enigmas changed their daily settings based on predetermined schedules, transmitted by courier to ships while in port.</p>
<p>This is where the known plaintext attack became useful. No human could screen the tens of thousands of keys attempted by the bombes on a daily basis, but the machines could be configured to automatically detect common paintext phrases, most often "EINS" (German for <i>one</i>), or "HEILHITLER". Upon decrypting such a phrase, the machines were configured to halt and make the operator aware of the potential hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm afraid this has a number of problems. 1) A single bombe examined the keys in series, not in parallel. Although there might be a dozen Enigma-equivalents used at each point, each rotor setting was examined in sequence. 2) The bombes were used for most Enigma traffic, not just that of the Navy, since the double encipherment indicator procedure came to an end in May 1940. 3) The bombes did not recognize plaintext. The bombe performed logical deductions on a <a href="../../../k/n/o/Known_plaintext.html" title="Known plaintext">known plaintext</a> and flagged those which did not lead to a logical contradiction. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 09:17, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should talk about the revisions to <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombe.html" title="Bombe">bombe</a>. I was trying to give an explaination without the hand waving so people could get the gist of the idea. Admittedly, it was oversimplified. I also don't understand why you excised my description of the Stecker board. The sentence you left has no context. Perhaps we could negotiate a joint text.

<dd>Sure; the problem was that your description wasn't just oversimplified, but (I'm afraid to say) it was actually incorrect. But I do think hand-waving gists are good, and I think it's a good idea to start off with such a summary before lurching into a description of the nitty-gritty detail of how it worked. I'm very happy (in fact, prefer!) to work collaboratively (after all, this is Wikipedia&#160;;-) ). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a></dd>

<dd>Sure; your description said <i>If one had a guess, say that the letter G as input should produce a letter K as output, one could connect a voltage to the G input of the spinning set of rotors and use the K output to stop the motor. The stack would then spin until there was a match.</i> — if there was no plugboard, such a machine would have worked, but this is not what the bombe did; the plugboard stops you from knowing the input and output to the rotors. So Turing had to come up with something a little more subtle. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 19:27, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>ok Matt, let me rephrase: (pls edit and state ambiguity) I think this is a good verbal explanation&#160;!!</p>
<p>Assume you find a triple loop abc, ideally in plain: abc, cipher: bca.</p>
<p>plaintext&#160;: a big cool</p>
<p>cipher &#160;: b cxy aqwe</p>
<p><br />
a-b b-c c-a = a closed triplet (A-B-C --&gt;A) OK&#160;?</p>
<p><br />
So with a crib you find plaintext letter a mapped to cipher b, plain b to c, and plain c to cipher a again within short distance .</p>
<p>Now assemble the rotor mechanisms of three enigmas serial-in-line (abovementioned triplets) and set it to the original rotor positions,</p>
<p>with their offset (here 1 step each) accordingly. Then you get a corresponding physical wire closed loop from the input of the first triplet to the output of the 3rd triplet. {Now this in fact is turings cool idea&#160;! try to understand this and ure a genius too&#160;! no really, the letter loops corrspond to physical wire loops which can be detected by a el.circuit quickly }</p>
<p>You can detect this with lamps connected to the rotor contacts. {wire 'em up to + and - pole}</p>
<p>The lamp in the wire loop will stay dark. {meaning triplet fit}</p>
<p>Now you turn the rotor systems synchronously. {this is called decryption, to find da rotor position}</p>
<p>If only one lamp stays dark because of the one wire loop, you can quickly calculate the Steckerfeld, and reject those positions with all lamps lit. As mentioned, this typically happens several times in 17000 permutations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not clear where the lamps are connected, nor is it clear why the lamps stay dark. Moreover, the Bombe didn't use lamps. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 10:30, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
