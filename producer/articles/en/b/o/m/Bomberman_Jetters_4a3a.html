<p>The anime tells the story of the <i>Higehige dan</i>, or "Higehige <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandit.html" title="Bandit">bandits</a>", who are a group of thieves foiled constantly by the Jetters.</p>
<p>The Jetters consist of Mighty (the Legendary Bomberman), Dr. Ein, the founder as well as Gangu's creator, Birdy, Shout, Bongo, and Gangu.</p>
<p>There are <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_GameCube_cf58.html" title="Nintendo GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_2_dbfa.html" title="PlayStation 2">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_Advance_f612.html" title="Game Boy Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> adaptations of the anime, also called <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomberman_Jetters_%28game%29_38ef.html" title="Bomberman Jetters (game)">Bomberman Jetters</a>. Only the GameCube version is available in the US.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamecube.html" title="Gamecube">Gamecube</a> Jetters Game features Shirobon as the main character and uses the same-style cel-shaded animation as Bomberman Generations, while the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_Advance_f612.html" title="Game Boy Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> version features Mighty Bomber as the main character using the same <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">Zelda</a>-style gameplay as <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomberman_Tournament_7ff6.html" title="Bomberman Tournament">Bomberman Tournament</a>.</p>
<p>There was also another Jetters game for GBA which is a collection of Mini-games including the Classic Bomberman multiplayer pack where you can choose to play as the characters from the TV series such as White Bomber, Shout, Birdy, Mujo, Mighty and others.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>Mighty, the leader of the Jetters, disappears while on a mission. Dr. Ein accepts Mighty's younger brother, Shirobon ("White Bomberman" in the U.S. video game), into the Jetters. Shirobon is clumsy and childish, but idolizes his older brother. After assuming his brother's place on the team, Shirobon leads the search for Mighty.</p>
<p>Like <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X_c94d.html" title="Sonic X">Sonic X</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/g/Kirby%7E_Right_Back_at_Ya%21_5e1c.html" title="Kirby: Right Back at Ya!">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Mew_Mew_9bc3.html" title="Tokyo Mew Mew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a>, early episodes of Bomberman Jetters started out with a "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_of_the_week.html" title="Monster of the week">monster of the week</a>" formula, where Dr. MechaDoc and Mujo would send in one of their Super Combined Bomberman to attack the Jetters each episode, similar to how King Dedede sends out one of his Nightmare Enterprise Monsters after <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby_%28Nintendo%29_0989.html" title="Kirby (Nintendo)">Kirby</a> or how in Season 1 of Sonic X, Dr. Eggman would send out one of his E-Series robots after Sonic one at a time.</p>
<p>As the episodes progressed, the format shifted from light-hearted comedy "monster of the week" to a more dramatic, darker action story with some tear-breaking drama dealing with the trials of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrayal.html" title="Betrayal">betrayal</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a>. This includes characters going through their own trials with huge character development such as Shout learning the truth about her mother and how Bagular first met Mujo and Shirobon dealing with the trials learning the truth of what happened to his older brother Mighty.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Shirobon</b> (White Bomber) - Shirobon is only about ten, and often very clumsy and quite dense. He wrecks things by accident, in sharp contrast to his older brother Mighty. His little accidents tend to make a critical situation worse, much to Shout's frustration. He also will brag endlessly about any achievement, no matter how little.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flame Bomber</b> - A flame wielding Bomber who was the first Bomber Shitennou seen in action and defeated White Bomber with his own two hands but was over powered then destroyed by White Bomber's new flame based bomb star. He seems to be a little kid at heart and loves to play with fire.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mermaid Bomber</b> - A female water wielding Bomber Shitennou who has a crush on Birdy but was brought down by him. She was proud and arrogant. She likes to use her looks on Mujoe to get what she wants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Grand Bomber</b> - A strong and kind Bomber Shitennou who was asked to join the Jetters but refused because of his ties and forced White Bomber to destroy him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Thunder Bomber</b> - The Electric wielding final Bomber Shitennou. Incredibly loyal to Mujoe and emotional, he wants to expose those who are framing Mujoe at all costs. He was later destroyed by Max's world famous attack, Hyper Plasma Bomb.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Seagull Bomber</b> - Not a member of the Bomber Shitennou, but deserves an honorable mention. Seagull Bomber was the only super-combined bomberman to make it past the B-1 championship and was even around in the final episode, but that was because everyone ignored him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dark Force Bomber</b> - The anime Dark Force Bomber was created by combinding Mechadoc with the four Proto-Max units. His only attack was the Dark Force Bomb.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bagura</b> - Bagura is the mastermind behind the Hige-Hige Gang. He is not actually evil, and was great friends with the Jetters' founder, Dr. Ein, but they were split by an intense rivalry for the affections of Momo, Shirobon and Mighty's grandmother. Later episodes,it's revealed that Bagular is nothing more than a pawn in Dr Mecha Doc's sinister scheme of over throwing him to take over the Hige Hige Bandits. he resembles a large blue beardly old man with a letter B on his forehead and wears one gold glass-eye over one of his eyes and his a belt, gloves and a red cape.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mujoe</b> - A pawn of Bagular, Mujoe is usually in charge of commanding the Hige-Hige Gang's troops. He resembles a pro wrestler, in that he has blonde hair, a blonde mustache/beard and a strange-looking spandex suit. He also wears shades and a large green cape. He apparently has a look-alike called Achou, although Achou lives on the Charabom planet, leads the Chige-Chige bandits, is not evil, and is more successful at the missions he undertakes. Mujoe used the Super Combined Bomberman Making Machine and shot at Charaboms to make Mermaid Bomber, Thunder Bomber, Fire Bomber, and Grand Bomber.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr Mecha Doc</b> - Mecha Doc is the Hige Hige Bandits' mad scientist and Bagular's more trusted right hand henchman who does all the building and machinery for Bagular and the Hige Hige Bandits. In Episode 40: Coup d'etat Outbreak!, it was revealved that Mecha Doc and Bagular went to the same science academy back in their younger days, and Mecha Doc blames Bagular for stealing his ideas about the bomb crystals. As a result, MechaDoc goes into a corrupted beserk rage, locking Bagular up in prison and taking over the Hige Hige Bandits. His ultimate plan is to collide both planet Bomber and planet Jetters together until both planets are destroyed. His main creation is the Super Combined Bomberman Making Machine to turn any inanimate objects or helpless charaboms into his own Bombermen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hige-Hige bandits</b> - The basic members of the Hige-Hige gang (hence the name) created by Bagura. They are very weak when separated but a powerful fighting force in numbers. To those outside the Hige-Hige Bandits, it appears all they can say is "Hige", but it is apparently a language in and of itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Max</b>(MA-10[X]) - At first solely referred to as the infamous "Space Bounty Hunter," it is later discovered that he is a creation of Mechadoc. He has no feelings or compassion, and will do whatever it takes to reach his goal. He dies in episode 51 but manages to write his data into Zero in the same episode hence taking control of his body.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Proto-Max</b> - The Proto-Max units are the other MA-X proto types. One was very short, wore shorts, and attacked with a slingshot. This "Proto-Max Jr." was defeated by Ninja Bomber and Dai-Bon. One of the Proto- Max units had a drill on his right arm and a fin coming out from each eye-plate. This "Drill-Max" was defeated by Shirobon and Birdy. One Proto-Max had his head attached directly to his torso, and was much bulkier than the others. This "Heavy-Max" was defeated by Oyabon. The final Proto-Max had two purple spikes comeing out from under his helmet, had no razor crest, and used a boomerang. This "Boomerang-Max" was defeated by Zero.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mighty</b> - Shirobon's brother and bears a striking resemblance to original <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomberman.html" title="Bomberman">Bomberman</a>. Mighty has a silver visor covering his right eye, wears a red cape and has slightly thicker eyebrows and has fingers, but those are the only major differences between him and Bomberman. It is later revealed that his grandfather wore similar clothing. Mighty and Shirobon also share a very close brother bond. Mighty has some of the personality traits of Shirobon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr. Ein</b> - A scientist who founded the Jetters. He has an annoying tendency to blow his nose on any piece of paper nearby, including letters of resignation, leading, understandably, to much confusion. He also has a crush on Momo, Shirobon and Mighty's grandmother. Often regarded as a joke character, he actually has a serious side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Momo</b> - A very swift and powerful Bomber who lives with her grandsons, Shirobon and Mighty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Shout</b> - Shout is the bad mouthed only female of the Jetters. After Mighty's disappearance, Shout became the leader of the Jetters. Shout picks on Shirobon but she actually cares for him like a brother. Her mother died in a space flight accident when she was a child.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Gangu</b> - A robot created by Dr. Ein. He is a unique robot that wields gizmoes in his body to assist the Jetters. He did not remember when he was created or who created him, and has a recurring dream about fighting and defeating a giant robot. One day when he asked out loud, Dr. Ein admitted to it, and told him an elaborate story about the reason for his creation, after which Dr. Ein said it was all a lie. But he did create Gangu.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bongo</b> - A large-bodied inventor who helps Dr. Ein and enjoys modifying Gangu, mostly without Gangu's permission. Also, like most of his species, he enjoys curry and ends his sentences with "bongo." Though he doesn't look like it, he is a royal prince.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Birdy</b> - A member of the Jetters and a personal friend of Mighty, Birdy is a competent fighter and rarely reveals his emotions, but he loses his temper easily. As a side job he works as a taxi driver.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Charaboms</b> - Charaboms are a unique and sometimes quite powerful species. Most Charaboms have an element that corresponds to their attack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Louie</b> - Louie is a green, kangaroo-like animal with rabbit ears who helps Bomberman by letting him ride on his back. His species is one generally chosen by Bombermen as a sidekick. Louie often washes dishes at the Jetters ramen shop. Louis is also a good ramen cook and is very devoted to what ever he does. In one episode, Louie and Birdy had to protect a rare trumpet because Shout and Shirobon were sick. Louie tried to protect it with a broom (and later, a vacuum cleaner) and fireworks. Gango and Shirobon are the only ones who can understand him, but Birdy did buy a book on Rooey language. All he can say is "Rui" (which is his Japanese name).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Zero</b>(MA-0) - A Bomber who wields extreme speed and power and wears a cloak and beares resemblance to Max and is also a mysterious character. He is, in fact, the Ma-X prototype Ma-0 (hence the unfinished eye plate). He was sent out to absorb Mighty's bomb abilities and absorbed/copied Mighty's soul in the process. This was not supposed to happen, and Zero attacked Mechadoc upon awakening, and Mechadoc disabled him and left him in the ruins of the previous Hige-Hige base. He works with a thief named Misty, a previous acquaintance, and tries to keep his true identity hidden. Zero dies in the final episode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Misty</b> - Misty is a cat-like girl with a short temper like Shout. She fell in love with Mighty, and later took in Zero after finding him while visiting the site of Mighty's death. She knew Zero's true identity since she met him, and constantly gets him to reveal knowledge only Mighty should have known without him knowing it.</li>
