<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay_Quadrangular_90cd.html" title="Edit section: Presidency Match">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency Match</span></h2>
<p>The Quadrangular tournament had its origins in an annual match played between the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> members of the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay_Gymkhana_04e3.html" title="Bombay Gymkhana">Bombay Gymkhana</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsi.html" title="Parsi">Parsis</a> of the <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrian.html" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a> Cricket Club. The first such game was played in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, when the Bombay Gymkhana accepted a request for a two-day match from the Parsis. The game was played in good spirit, with the Parsis surprising the Europeans by taking a first <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings.html" title="Innings">innings</a> lead. The Gymkhana recovered, but the match was drawn with the sides evenly poised. The challenge was played again in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a> and looked set to become an annual event, but racial discontent intervened. From <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>, the Parsis and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindus</a> of Bombay were locked in a struggle against the governing Europeans over the use of the playing fields known as the Bombay Maidan. Gymkhana members would play <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo.html" title="Polo">polo</a> on the field, rendering much of it useless for cricket because of the large divots left by the horses, while sparing their own European-only cricket ground. With this dispute settled in favour of the natives, the Europeans versus Parsis matches resumed in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> game was memorable as a thrilling victory to the Parsis, with the Gymkhana setting a low target of 53 runs in the final innings. Parsi captain M. E. Pavri <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bowling (cricket)">bowled</a> well to help dismiss the Europeans for 50, just 3 runs short of victory. Matches from <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>–<a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">93</a> are given <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_class_cricket.html" title="First class cricket">first class</a> status. The match that began at Bombay Gymkhana on August 26, 1892 is considered the earliest first class match in India. By <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, the Presidency Match — as the Europeans versus Parsis game had come to be called — was the highlight of the Bombay cricket season. In the 19 matches to this year, the teams had won eight each and drawn three.</p>

<p>While the Europeans and Parsis were regularly playing against each other, the Hindu Gymkhana had been amassing its own quality players. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, the Hindus challenged the Parsis to a match, but the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communalism_%28South_Asia%29_4dc2.html" title="Communalism (South Asia)">communal</a> differences between the clubs led the Parsis to decline. The Bombay Gymkhana stepped in and accepted the challenge, leading to the first Europeans versus Hindus match, played that February. The Hindu side ended up recording a stunning 110-run victory over the Europeans. The Hindus boasted <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palwankar_Baloo_8922.html" title="Palwankar Baloo">Palwankar Baloo</a>, who is regarded as India's first great <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_bowling.html" title="Spin bowling">spin bowler</a>, and perhaps the first person from the lower <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit.html" title="Dalit">Dalit</a> <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> to make an impact in an Indian sporting arena. He was not allowed the captaincy of the team because of his caste, but his younger brother Vithal, a batsman, would go on to captain the Hindus in 1923, following a campaign to accord recognition to the Palwankar brothers in the wake of the anti-casteism advocated during the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Independence_Movement_89be.html" title="Indian Independence Movement">Indian Independence Movement</a>.</p>
<p>The next year, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, saw the first Triangular tournament featuring teams from the Bombay and Hindu Gymkhanas as well as the Zoroastrian Cricket Club. From 1907 to <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> the tournament was played in September, with the Europeans winning three times and the Parsis twice.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay_Quadrangular_90cd.html" title="Edit section: Bombay Quadrangular">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bombay Quadrangular</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> of the Mohammedan Gymkhana were invited to the now famous Bombay tournament, making it a Quadrangular. The tournament was held throughout <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, but poor weather at the end of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsoon.html" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a> season rained out four of the six finals played up until <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, the Quadrangular was moved to November/December to avoid such problems. Another change for the 1917 tournament was the use of neutral <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28cricket%29.html" title="Umpire (cricket)">umpires</a> for the first time. Up to this season, a European umpire appointed by the Bombay Gymkhana had always officiated, but from now on the umpires for any match would be supplied by the non-competing teams. This was one of the first uses of neutral umpires in world cricket.</p>
<p>The Quadrangular became more popular than its predecessor, and for many years formed the highlight of the Bombay year. This was against the background of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Gandhi</a>'s campaigns for the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Independence_Movement_89be.html" title="Indian Independence Movement">Indian home rule</a>. Gandhi and his followers were critical of the Quadrangular, seeing it as a method of pacifying the natives and ensuring loyalty to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British</a> rule and its ideals of sport. Gandhi, who had himself played cricket as a schoolboy, was not against having a cricket tournament, but was opposed to having teams on the basis of religion. In 1940 he is known to have asked the "sporting public of Bombay to revise their sporting code and erase it from communal matches." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> tournament attracted particular attention, as <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales</a> visited Bombay during it. His arrival sparked three days of political rioting in Bombay, but did not disrupt the tournament. After the riots had ended, he attended the first day of the final, accepting cheers from a pro-European crowd, who eventually witnessed the Bombay Gymkhana prevail over the Parsis.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, the Gymkhanas were recruiting players from all over the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, making the Bombay Quadrangular the biggest and most influential cricket tournament in India. It also inspired other local competitions, including a Triangular in <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> and Quadrangulars in <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagpur.html" title="Nagpur">Nagpur</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, that led to the rapid development of cricket throughout the region. Although the Quadrangular partly quelled discrimination on racial or <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> lines, the question of religion came up in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>. The Hindu Gymkhana initially extended an invitation to P. A. Kanickam of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> to play for them. Later they discovered that the player was not a Hindu, but a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>, and withdrew their invitation. With the Europeans not accepting Indians, and the Hindus not accepting Christians, Kanickam had no way of playing in the tournament.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, Gandhi's campaign reached a climax with the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Satyagraha_eb74.html" title="Salt Satyagraha">Salt Satyagraha</a>, provoking <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_disobedience.html" title="Civil disobedience">civil disobedience</a> and the arrests of 60,000 Indians. Amidst this political turmoil, the Quadrangular tournament was cancelled. It was not held again until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, when the cricket-starved public enthusiastically supported its reinstatement. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, the sports editor of the nationalist Bombay Chronicle, J. C. Maitra, suggested the Quadrangular be replaced with a geographic-zone-based tournament, to remove the racial and religious overtones. A newspaper correspondent argued an opposite case, for expansion into a Pentangular, with a team for Indian Christians. The public however clamoured for the traditional format and these suggestions were ignored.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay_Quadrangular_90cd.html" title="Edit section: Bombay Pentangular">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bombay Pentangular</span></h2>
<p>Finally, in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, a fifth team, called The Rest, was admitted to the tournament. It comprised <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhists</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, and Indian Christians. On the odd occasion, players from <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Ceylon</a> appeared for them including at least one Hindu. The first Pentangular, however, was played between just four teams, as the Hindus withdrew in protest over not being allocated what they considered a fair share of seats in the new <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brabourne_Stadium_1b75.html" title="Brabourne Stadium">Brabourne Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, the Pentangular attracted growing criticism as being divisive because of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communalism_%28South_Asia%29_4dc2.html" title="Communalism (South Asia)">communalism</a> implicit in the makeup of the teams. This was exacerbated by the growing political movement for Indian independence, which wished to foster unity amongst Indians as opposed to competition. Eventually, amidst a backdrop of rioting and political unrest across India, the newly formed <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India_6b38.html" title="Board of Control for Cricket in India">Board of Control for Cricket in India</a> announced in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> that the Pentangular tournament was being abandoned, and being replaced by a zonal competition.</p>
