<p>Life long resident of Boise - there is no controversy that I've heard on how to properly pronounce Boise. It is boy-see. I've never heard a local pronounce it with a z, or claim that you could go either way.</p>
<p>Seriously, since when does a city article include the nicknames... especially the ones that no one seems to have heard of before? I nominate the deletion of it, simply because it doesn't seem professional nor portrays a positive image of Boise. <a href="../../../c/u/t/User%7ECutlerite_b7e6.html" title="User:Cutlerite">Cutlerite</a> 19:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can somebody tell me, is it pronounced "Boys", or "Boys-ee"? (Or something else?) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">GRAHAMUK</a> 11:57, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's pronounces "Boys-ee" or "Boy-zee". -- 67.75.231.4</p>
<hr />
<p>depends on the native to boise. I think If you've lived in boise your whole life, you pronounce it Boy-See, but only if you're older. Young natives say Boysee OR Boyzee, but as a californian, i've never heard any non-idahoans pronounce it Boysee.</p>
<hr />
<p>Natives will argue it is <i>always</i> pronounced "Boy-see" never "Boy-zee". -<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonMoore_d202.html" title="User:JonMoore">JonMoore</a> 10:03, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, no, no. It is always pronounced "Boy-Zee." The only people who say "Boy-See" are not from Idaho.</p>
<hr />
<p>I grew up (1960's-1970's) in a town within a 30-mile radius of Boise. Both my parents were born in southern Idaho and went to high school in Boise (when both their families moved there). One of my grandparents was born within the 30-mile radius of Boise. I grew up hearing (and using) the pronunciation Boy-See rather than Boy-Zee in my family and among my friends at school. My observation is that people who have not grown up in the Boise valley generally use the Boy-Zee pronunciation, and people who have grown up there use the Boy-See pronunciation. There are many people who have grown up in the Boise area who use the Boy-Zee pronunciation, however. I suspect this may be related to how recently the family has moved to the Boise area. My experience in traveling is that the Boy-See pronunciation is rarely heard outside the Boise area (unless the speaker grew up there and moved away as an adult). When I am outside the Boise area -- I went to undergraduate and graduate school "back east" -- my Boy-See pronunciation is something that people have frequently remarked on in my speech. If current local Boise media pronunciation (radio and TV news, public affairs, and advertising) is any indication of a local standard, my impression is that Boy-See is used far more frequently than Boy-Zee is.

<p>Sir, Last time I checked, the Wikipedia's purpose was not to convey inaccurate or incorrect information. Yet, you seem to be on a mission to do that very thing.</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the city is simple: "Boy-see." There is not letter "z" in the French word Bois, which is the root of the city's name.</p>
<p>Your compromise is not based in factual reality. The passage should, quite simply, read: Boise (pronounced "Boy-see")...</p>
<p>I work in television news in the Boise area -- and we get a FLOOD of calls whenever a new reporter pronounces the name of the city wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should add to the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oregon (pronounced Ore-uh-gun by natives, or Ore-uh-gone by people who don't know better)</li>
<li>Nevada (pronounced Nev-add-uh by natives, or Nev-ah-duh by people who don't know better)</li>
<li>Spokane (pronounced Spoke-ann by natives, or Spo-kane by people who don't know better)</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone in this thread has made the point that the pronunciation is Boy-see but you sir. Do you think you are the ultimate arbiter of the Wiki?</p>

<dd>I was, Sir, simply trying to convey that there are more than one opinion of how the name is pronounced. Having previously lived in Boise for a number of years, I agree most natives pronounce the word "BOY-see". The etymology of the word is from the French <i>boisé</i>, pronounced "bwah-ZAY" or something similar, which means "wooded". This information is from the Idaho Historical Society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I myself, out of personal preference, do pronounce it "BOY-see" and was simply trying to give all opinions equal time. I believe that is what Wikipedia is about. Being fair and equal. I would rather work with you rather than against you to make a good Wikipedia article for Boise. If you so feel to only give one side of the debate, than by all means, revert it. If you wish to, in good journalistic fashion, present all sides of the coin, then leave it as I wrote. I leave it in your hands. Thank You.

<p>I actually apologize. I wrote this, submitted it, then thought for a bit, tried to change it and resubmit, but Wikipedia crashed my computer, and it didn't go through. As I said, I would like to work to make this a good page.</p>
<p>If you feel that strongly about the pronounciation, it is not important enough to me to get into a flame/edit /revert war over it with you. I simply wanted to present that natives feel it is always pronounce "BOY-see", which we seem to agree upon, and that many people also pronounce it "BOY-zee" I have bigger fish to fry, as they say. Please do as you like.</p>

<p>i'm living outside boise right now, and everyone calls it boy-zee, and i always correct them. but really not many people care that much. i think that us boy-"see" people have a lot of pride about our name, which i do too, but i've noticed that mostly people just get annoyed.</p>
<hr />
<p>This conversation is ridiculous. If Wikipedia is about presenting factual information, then it should be said that <b>people generally pronounce the city's name in one of two ways</b>, and then list both those ways. These pronunciations aren't opinions, they aren't wrong, they're the way people pronounce the name. Wikipedia shouldn't be prescribing one prounciation based on the linguistic preconceptions of any particular person, whether that person has been a lifetime resident or happens to work in the local media.</p>
<p>_______</p>
<p>Although natives call is "Boi-see" and attest that this is correct, the actual French pronunciation is with a "Z". No matter though; it really is true that those who arent native use a Z sound and those who live here use an S sound...we can tell the difference.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The actual French pronounciation (forgive my attempt at English phonetics!) would be something like <i>Bwa-say</i>... so it really doesn't matter because neither version is even close! Nonetheless, I've always heard it as <i>Boy-zee</i> but then again, I don't know any natives. Convention would have the official pronounciation as pronounced by the natives. I vote for "S" and leave it at that. 66.183.217.31 22:27, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I heard a news report tonight (I live in Boise) which put Boise's population - individually, not the metropolitan area - over 200,000, which makes it the 3rd largest city in the northwest (passing Spokane and Tacoma, and making it third only to Seattle and Portland, respectively). I don't have the time to dig up the specific study or numbers at the moment, but if someone would like to look into it, it'd be worth noting. The explosive growth of the area as a whole might be worth mentioning, as well, but perhaps some of that should be included in greater depth under the <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_metropolitan_area.html" title="Boise metropolitan area">Boise metropolitan area</a> entry. Each of the surrounding cities has experienced at least 5% growth in the last few years, and Meridian had an amazing 17% growth according to the study cited on the news. Sorry I don't have a specific reference, but hopefully someone can find it soon, and if not I'll look into it myself.</p>
<p>The Boise metropolitan area entry also deserves some fleshing out, as the area is incredibly fast growing and rather renowned as a fast-growing, comfortable and opportunity-rich area.--<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyferret_5226.html" title="User:Happyferret">happyferret</a> 04:33, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Boise has five mainstream public high schools -- Borah, Boise, Capital &amp; Timberline from the Boise district -- and Centennial from the Meridian district.

<p>I notice there's a redirect to "Boise, ID" from "Boise City, ID", and that this article's Geography section calls the city "Boise City". The list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_statistical_areas_by_population_8a5e.html" title="List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population">metropolitan statistical areas</a> also gives the name Boise City (see #90 in the list). Clearly these two names are referring to the same place and clearly Boise is the common name of the city... is Boise City the official name? (I for one have always heard "Boise" but have run into "Boise City" enough that I don't think it's insignificant.)</p>
<p>It would be helpful if someone could find out and make the distinction clear in the article (possibly in the opening paragraph.) Krong 06:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has been a common confusion for years. Boise City is not the capital of Idaho, it is a very small town in Oklahoma. I think what sustains the confusion is that the word "city" is included in the title of some official agencies in Boise, ID. The word gets capitalized as part of the name, and make it look like the official name might be Boise City. Example: <a href="http://www.boiseschools.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.boiseschools.org/" rel="nofollow">Independent School District of Boise City</a>, which is an official name of the district, but you can see on it's web page that the common-used term is "Boise School District". There is also the use of "Boise City" to distinguish it from "Boise County" in Idaho government, as in "Boise City residents", as opposed to "Boise County residents". (Boise is in Ada County.) Outside those contexts, I've never heard it called "Boise City" in common usage. The <a href="http://cityofboise.org" class="external text" title="http://cityofboise.org" rel="nofollow">city web site</a> uses "Boise", "City of Boise", "Boise City", and "Boise city" interchangeably.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 16:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The use of "Boise City" was commonly used from the founding until the 1950's. This was to prevent confusion with "Fort Boise" and Boise County. This was gradually dropped from maps during the 1950's when the Interstate Highway system came through. If you look at old maps of Idaho, it is called "Boise City". "Fort Boise" was originally built by the Hudson Bay Company in 1834, 50 miles west of the city near the current city of Parma. "New Fort Boise" (Once located North of the city, of Boise, the city has since grown to surround the Fort) was built by the US Army in 1863. And yes, it is pronounced Boy`see. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushrom_0972.html" title="User:Mushrom">Mushrom</a> 18:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I amended the statments on population to reflect the following. There is no doubt that Boise is the third largest <b>metro area</b> in the Pacific Northwest behind Seattle and Portland. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_statistical_areas_by_population_8a5e.html" title="List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population">List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population</a>.</p>
<p>However, regardless of what the Boise media says, 2003 US Census estimates do place the city of Spokane (196,624) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5367000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5367000.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> just slightly ahead of Boise in population (190,117) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1608830.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1608830.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Spokane grew 0.5 percent between 2000 and 2003 while Boise grew 2.2 percent in the same period. I think it's only a matter of time before Boise's claim to be the third largest city in the PNW comes true, but not yet. --<a href="../../../f/a/u/User%7EFaustus37_e829.html" title="User:Faustus37">Faustus37</a> 17:23, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, thanks for signing. Second, there is argument AND doubt. The COMPASS report (cited in the story) casts that doubt. The phrasing as written is balanced. 2004 population estimates put Spokane at 196,721, while Boise is listed at 190,122. Spokane grew by just more than 1,000 people from 2000 to 2004, while Boise grew by about 5,000 people. It is possible, and actually quite likely that Boise has surpassed Spokane.

<p>Spokane proper is larger than Boise proper. If the Metro areas of Spokane (435,644) and Coeur D'Alene (122,350) were combined, as they should be due to the proximity of the two, and the nonstop sprawl between Spokane and CD'A, then Spokane proper and metro would be larger.

<dd>It wouldn't surprise me all that much if Spokane and CDA were merged into a single metro area at some point, but the fact remains it hasn't happened yet. The Census Bureau is behind on some things (note that the micropolitan area of <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin_Falls%2C_Idaho_732e.html" title="Twin Falls, Idaho">Twin Falls</a> is considerably larger than the metropolitan area of <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewiston%2C_Idaho_b690.html" title="Lewiston, Idaho">Lewiston</a>, for example).</dd>

<p>Yes, that makes sense, so the page should not say that boise may be larger than spokane. it should say the metro is larger. the only proof we have is the 2000 census, so that is what will have to be on the page, there shouldnt be any mights or could bes70.56.126.209 06:07, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These Census estmates "prove" absolutely nothing one way or another, especially considering (1) the latest numbers are three years old now and (2) even those showed a difference of less than four percent combined with a significantly higher historical rate of growth in Boise. It could very well be that as of 2006 Boise is indeed larger than Spokane. The problem is there's no definitive source to prove or disprove that (at least none I've seen). I have a feeling this matter won't be settled until the 2010 Census, and even then it'll be pretty close.</dd>

<p>According to this link, the US Census considers Spokane to be it's own metropolitin area. However, Boise is connected to Nampa toi make the "Boise Metropolitin Area". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_statistical_areas_by_population" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_statistical_areas_by_population" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_statistical_areas_by_population</a>. You will find that in this breakdown, Boise ranks higher then Spokane because of how they draw up the area. And I am not surprised. Even back in the early 1980's, we frequently refered to the area as "Boswell", meaning that everything between Boise and Caldwell was basically one large city. I have not been to Boise since 1995, but I doubt that has changed in the last 11 years. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushrom_0972.html" title="User:Mushrom">Mushrom</a> 1416, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adding the "Weasel" tag with out discussion is against the spirit of Wikipedia. I've removed it. Also, I restored earlier -- balanced -- language explaining the "third largest" claim, then pointing out that the information is contradicted. I don't think anyone here really thinks that Spokane is larger than Boise any longer, evidence and imperial data supports that. However, until new census figures are released, both sides should be presented. Also, one further note -- the debate is over the CITY of Boise and the CITY of Spokane, not the MSAs. Boise is larger than Salt Lake City by defining strict city boundaries, but clearly that metropolitan statistical area is much larger. Are we at compromise -- or should the language be further clarified? Boisemedia 06:26, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that spokane is larger, and if the MSAs were combined, as they should be, spokane/cda would be much larger, and yes, that is fine. spokane is also larger than salt lake city, and spokane is also larger than boise. 2000 census is the ONLY official data until 2010!<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpokaneWilly_49e1.html" title="User:SpokaneWilly">SpokaneWilly</a> 03:25, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did a little more research on this. It appears to me that <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma%2C_Washington_361e.html" title="Tacoma, Washington">Tacoma</a> has just as strong a claim, if not stronger, than Boise or Spokane as the third-largest city in the PNW.</p>
<p>In terms of city proper, according to 2003 Census estimates the five largest cities in the PNW in order are: Seattle (569,101) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5363000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5363000.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, Portland (538,544) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/41/4159000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/41/4159000.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, Tacoma (196,790) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5370000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5370000.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, Spokane (196,624) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5367000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5367000.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and Boise (190,117) <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1608830.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1608830.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>Metro areas break out like this:</p>
<p>Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA - 2,421,417<br />
Portland-Vancouver-Beaverton, OR-WA - 2,064,336<br />
Tacoma, WA - 745,411<br />
Boise City-Nampa, ID - 524,884<br />
Spokane, WA - 435,644<br /></p>
<p>NOTE: Seattle and Tacoma are technically part of the same metro area, but they're also officially separated by the Census Bureau in "Metropolitan Divisions," which I'm using here. <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metropop/table01.xls" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metropop/table01.xls" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>In short, Tacoma, Spokane and Boise are in a virtual tie for third place when considering city proper populations. If you consider Tacoma as a separate metro from Seattle, it's the third largest. If you don't, then Boise is the third-largest.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seattle and Portland are clearly first and second in population.</li>
<li>Tacoma, Spokane and Boise are for all practical purposes the same size when dealing strictly with the cities.</li>
<li>Boise's metro area is bigger than Spokane's (and no, you can't count Coeur d'Alene as part of Spokane just because you want to).</li>
<li>Tacoma as a separate metro area is bigger than both Boise and Spokane.</li>
<li>Boise can make a claim as the third-largest city in the PNW, but only with a considerable amount of fudging and spin.</li>

Google it if you dont believe me; the newest COMPASS reports put Boise proper at nearly 239,000.

<p>Pronunciation has been throughly dealt with in this article. The added graph is not needed. Also, the odd paragraph attempting to give Boise a nickname is both a) untrue and b) uneeded. No one has called Boise by that name. It fails the Google test, you can't cite it - and it's just plain untrue. Boisemedia 07:36, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not all true information is on the Internet. You cannot naively assume that which shows up on google is true and that which does not is false. Bobo is a legitimate nickname for Boise which is used by at least several hundered people in the North End. It shouldn't be such a surprise to those who have not heard it. Our downtown mall is called BoDo a contraction of Boise and Downtown which is itself a variation of Bobo.</p>

<p>"Bobo" is'nt legit. If Bobo is legit, then so is "B-town", Bwa-seee", and "B-shizle". Put that in those in there too. -me</p>
<p>Cosigned. I've spent the majority of my life in Boise and have never once heard a single human being udder the term "Bobo." Also the general consensus about "Bodo" is that most Boise natives have a strong dislike for the term. I don't feel that it belongs in the article at all, all it will serve to do is to justify non-natives to call Boise "Bobo." - JoshuaJenkins</p>
<p>I remember hearing my grandmother call the town "Bobo", that was back in the 1970's though. She lived in the North End (28th &amp; Hill). But generally, it was not a widely used name, and largely fell out of use by the 1980's. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushrom_0972.html" title="User:Mushrom">Mushrom</a> 16:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suggested to Joseph Coffland, (the guy who started the Bobo nickname paragraph) a long while ago that there should be a separate link to all of the nicknames that boise can be called, as well as the pronunciation debate. He responded, "In short, you caught me. The nickname Bobo is editorial promotion of my own view point. I think Boise's Wikipedia page is a cool place for public access media.

<dd>Actually, according to the link provided by the unsigned user <small>(user:70.160.61.201)</small> above, of the 44.5% of Boise residents that consider themselves to be religious, the majority is LDS(15.2%), ahead of Catholics (12.3%), and Protestants (10.6%).

<p>Then the reverse is also true...ie 55.5% (a clear majority) of the residents of Boise are non-religious. Statistically speaking, 15.2% is NOT indicative of an overwelming majority that would require the use of the word "large". A better approach would be to simply remove "large", or possibly add the actual figures. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.160.61.201 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.160.61.201.html" title="User talk:70.160.61.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.160.61.201_355e.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.160.61.201">contribs</a>) 21:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Okay, I can see from your edit history that you're new at this, so I'll try to be nice here. Whatever your issue with the LDS church may be, it doesn't change the fact that there was a large number of LDS members in the region in 1984, as the sentence states. It doesn't change the fact that there are 28,000+ LDS people in Boise alone. That's a large number of people for a city Boise's size. The article also states that there is a large number of Basque folks living in Boise, and yet there are more Mormons than Basques. Why aren't you quibbling over the semantics of that section? Your help with Wikipedia is welcome, but not if your personal issues inhibit the group editing process. Another case in point, your edits to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cris_Collinsworth_df21.html" title="Cris Collinsworth">Cris Collinsworth</a> today bordered on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>.

<p>According to the Wikipedia guideline on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html#Self-promotion" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Self-promotion</a>, there should be very few commercial references in an article like this. Looking at the history of the article, a link to the <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho_Statesman_023b.html" title="Idaho Statesman">Idaho Statesman</a> was included early in the creation, which, in my opinion, is justified because the Statesman has been around long enough to play a role in the city's history and heritage. However, since the citation of the Statesman, it looks like every competing media outlet has worked its way onto the page, making the <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise%2C_Idaho_9089.html#Media" title="Boise, Idaho">Media</a> section read like the yellow pages. It gets worse when links are added such as this one, <a href="http://www.idaho-media.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.idaho-media.com/" rel="nofollow">Boise Journal and Boise Home</a>, that do not provide current news and information, it is only a commercial vehicle for selling subscriptions. I think since there is a separate article on <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_in_Boise%2C_Idaho_c844.html" title="Media in Boise, Idaho">Media in Boise, Idaho</a>, a lot of these links and references could be deleted, but I'd like to reach a group concensus before doing that.

<dd>I mostly agree with Atomic skier, however I don't think the piece should include any media (how do you apply a special standard to the Statesman that doesn't also include KTVB [which reaches more people each day than the Statesman, and has been around for 55 years]). Let me state my bias: I work in the Boise-area media. I would suggest the clause read like this:
