<p>There seems to be a problem. Now, dont get me wrong, I think that people adding to wikipedia is great. However it needs to be put in the proper section. Boilerplate Text is the decal/logo things that appear at the top of a page (Neutrality, Current Event, etc). Boilerplate text is not just any formatting.

<p>Is it considered detrimental to the Wikipedia for people to include links to WikiProjects at the bottom of article pages? I, for one, never would have considered the <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiProject_U.S._States_fda8.html" title="WikiProject U.S. States">WikiProject U.S. States</a> if I hadn't seen a link at the bottom of the State articles.</p>
<p>Mav is of the opinion that these notes aren't appropriate for Wiki pages, and he may be right. This is the comment he posted to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_French_departements_3518.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject French departements">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject French departements</a>, along with some responses I've inserted:</p>
<ul>
<li>When potential readers see it, they may feel obligated to visit and agree to the WikiProject in order to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>You have to balance that against the harm of potential users who see a new page and have no idea how to contribute. Some articles are already well laid out, and people will feel uncomfortable adding to them without some idea of their structure.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Talk is a page for comments about how to improve the article. The article namespace is not a good place for this.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>In theory, Talk is the best place for all meta info. However, we tend to include important info in the article (disambiguation notes, for instance), because people don't immediately go to the Talk page for this stuff. This is particularly true of inexperienced users.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Whenever we make articles we should try to make it as useful to readers as possible. Ugly tags detract from the article and are not intended for mere readers anyway; WikiProject tags are for contributors who want to majorly add to a set of articles. These people will visit talk anyway.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the contrary. I've been here for a while so I know all about the WikiProjects. New users are the people who need the WikiProject tags. The worst you can say about them is that they give an impression that the article is a work-in-progress; this is hardly objectionable when the article</i> is <i>in fact very incomplete. The tags can be removed once the article reaches a certain level of maturity. They can be removed automatically if they follow a certain format.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>These tags are self-conscience and considerations on how Wikipedia articles will look in print form are important (these tags will have to be removed before a print version is made, so it is best to limit their use).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is another "Wikipedia should look great now" at the expense of its future development. Who cares how an article looks in print, if it's incomplete and useless? The tags can be removed once the article has been made worth printing.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>WikiProjects are for a set of users to agree on a set of guidelines. Nobody else is bound by those guidelines. However the tag implies that those guidelines should be followed in order to contribute. This is very unwiki.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>It seems that your objection is with WikiProjects themselves rather than simply the idea of adding links. WikiProjects clearly state that they're just a set of guidelines. If this is unclear, then it should be made so in the link.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The major WikiProjects (Countries, Elements and Sports) do not have these type of tags in articles (the talk pages od converted element articles mention who did the conversion and that the conversion was based on WikiProject Elements).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Complete pages don't need these tags anymore. Just incomplete ones like the auto-generated U.S. towns articles Ram-Man is currently adding. A lot of people are going to hit these carefully laid out, but woefully incomplete articles and be intimidated into not contributing. WikiProjects might give them a way forward. So long as the WikiProjects are clearly marked as being suggestions and not requirements.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Reaction:</i> I have the feeling that these will give a way backward rather than forward. Imagining myself as a beginning Wikipedia-user, I don't see what's intimidating about having a page with some subheadings already put in that I would not contribute to it. However, if a page says "This page is part of Wiki-project so-and-so", I assume that there are some people working on these things, who will probably rather not be disturbed by my changes as they do a lot of more work on all these cities. And I (still as a new Wikipedian) don't have the courage or don't have the knowledge to really do a lot on this project, so I just leave this page to those WikipediaProject people too for the time being. Besides, I'd have to go through those project-rules first too. If <i>that</i> is not enough to intimidate someone, then a bit of text and some subheaders should also cause no problems. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 16:33 Oct 22, 2002 (UTC)</p>

If you need suggestions, visit <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">WikiProject U.S. Cities</a>".

<p>While I was originally of the idea to put these boilerplates in the articles themselves (In fact I put hundreds and maybe thousands of them in), I changed my view when confronted about it. In essence, they do not belong in an encyclopedia article. Nevertheless, I am still somewhat split. I am all about articles having a similar look so that they are consistant. That is always a good thing. Those users who are new will come in and add a line here or there. If someone wants to write a whole article, let them do so. Someone else can later bring it into a format consistant with the wikiproject. If someone is that motivated, there is a good chance that they already know about the wikiprojects anyway. And we can always *tell* them. Leave them in the talk pages. They can still be found. Oh, having the boilerplates artificially increases the byte count of articles (For what its worth). -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a></p>
<p>I'm inclined to agree with Andre. So long as the article is incomplete enough that the WikiProject guidelines still have a strong potential impact on its future development, then it's reasonable to give the impression that the article is still being worked on by that jarring, unprofessional tag ^_^. — <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby</a> 17:10 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel like revisiting this. Didn't realize this discussion was so old. I've been a serious contributor to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_65b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> pages. Part of our discussion of taxoboxes included considering putting a link to the relevant projects in the taxobox. Although I was (and still am) for the notion of having a link to the Projects in the article someplace, I'm even more interested in having te sidebar indicate that the work put into the article was done at least partly with the consideration of the guidelines of a Project. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 02:22, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In doing articles on, for instance, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Res_ipsa_loquitur.html" title="Res ipsa loquitur">res ipsa loquitur</a>, I've had some need for a legal disclaimer. Something analogous to the spoiler warning might work, for instance, <i>"Wikipedia is not legal advice."</i>, linking to a "Wikipedia:Wikipedia Is Not Legal Advice" page containing something like:</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is intended as a general reference. It is not intended as a source of legal advice, and its writers are not necessarily licensed to practice law in any particular jurisdiction. For advice on legal matters, consult an attorney.</dd>

<p>In the disambiguation text choices, one place it uses '''_''' (three single quotes; bold) for the term, but in the other two it uses "_" (a double quote; quoted) for it. Me, I'm inclined to think it should be either '''''_''''' (five single quotes; bold &amp; italic) or "'''_'''" (three single inside a double; quoted bold), but we should probably decide on one or the other either way. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 13:51 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>For images, I've experimented with a padding of 10 pixels (as shown in the boilerplates), and also 5 pixels. My conclusion so far is that 5 pixels seem to be enough in all cases, and that 10 pixels seems to appear excessive in many cases. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 09:03 May 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've drafted a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Wikipedia%7ERisk_disclaimer_853e.html" title="Wikipedia:Risk disclaimer">Wikipedia:risk disclaimer</a> if anyone has any suggestions questions, etc. please do not hesitate to contact me or post a comment on <a href="../../../r/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7ERisk_disclaimer_c76c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Risk disclaimer">Wikipedia talk:risk disclaimer</a>. It is just a proposed disclaimer and seems a good idea if you are writing text on Wikipedia that suggests dangerous activities such as <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungee_jumping.html" title="Bungee jumping">bungee jumping</a>. It is not a general disclaimer — there does not seem to be a policy to have a general disclaimer on Wikipedia as far as I can tell which is why you might want to put such a diclaimer on any page that describes very dangerous activities. No one would want anyone to try these things, but there are people who may not realize this when they read something on a web page, it seems to me that a prudent or reasonable person would want to warn others that the activity might be dangerous so that if the reader then followed the directions in the text, it would be their decision and not negligence on the part of the person posting the information. I doubt that Wikipedia could be held responsbile for anything posted as anyone can edit text. — <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't the fact that these activities <i>are</i> dangerous part of what we want to report on? <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a how-to guide so any NPOV article on any dangerous activity will explain, in some detail, <i>why</i> something is dangerous and then give some statistics to back up these data. Wouldn't that preclude any potential risk to the Wikipedia authors over the potential liability of what they write? IMO a risk disclaimer linked from individual articles is a very poor way to add this type of information to a topic. It would be far better to have a general disclaimer link next to the copyright info link on the bottom of <i>every</i> page on Wikipedia. Since we are a Wiki edited largely by non-experts then <i>every</i> page is a risky thing to rely on. My other thoughts on why this is a very bad idea are already on the above referenced talk page. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd>Interestingly enough I have done a decent number of those myself but I generally captilize the "L" so that it is consistent with all of the other entries such as "Law and Government", "Sites of Interest", and "Colleges and Universities" (see <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster%2C_Pennsylvania_3663.html" title="Lancaster, Pennsylvania">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>). Now maybe this is wrong and we should follow a different standard, but in any case it would be easy to do a mass replace of headings to a single format.

I've always capitilized the major headings because they are titles, but I do realize that the articles only capitilize the first word if it is not a proper word. But isn't that just so it is consistent to find articles? If you want to find an article on Chinese food, it is <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_food.html" title="Chinese food">Chinese food</a>, not <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Food_d606.html" title="Chinese Food">Chinese Food</a>. But this reason does not apply to headers as they are not titles. In this case I follow the standard literary format of capitilizing all the main words in a title/heading. This *is* supposed to someday be a print format, and doing it this way would keep it the same as the wide majority of other printed text. I personally think this makes the most sense to the broader audience, but maybe there is another compelling reason for it. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a></dd>

<dd>There is one problem with that though: The H1 title that heads each article (the article's name) is going to be usually lowercase unless it is a proper noun.

<dd>In a wiki the title should be the same as what a person would link to within the text. Since that is going to be lower-case most of the time (unless it is a proper noun or is the first letter) then the title should be lower-case. The title is the H1 heading of the article. Ergo H2, H3, H4 ect should also be lower-case (except the first letter and unless the particular words are proper nouns). All nice and logical. Oh, and even non-wiki texts (such as dictionaries and other encyclopedias) also usually lower-case common nouns. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<p>The longest of the <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_text_9c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate text">boilerplates</a> for disambiguation had a semicolon which i just replaced with a comma, to keep the noun phrase following it ("that is, one that just points to other pages that might otherwise have the same name") from being a sentence fragment.</p>
<p>But to come to the point, i am nearly as certain that the inner dependent clause in that noun phrase ("that might otherwise have the same name") is a statement contrary to fact and that its mode should therefore be subjunctive. IMO that follows from the fact that the statement "it might be" is contradicted by the statement "it isn't". If something <i>has</i> something else in some of the cases under discussion, then it <i>might have</i> the other thing in any particular (but as yet unspecified) case. In our situation, "other pages ..." <i>never</i> "... have the same name" bcz that would violate our basic software design, and our software is well enough implemented to prevent it.</p>

<p>Can I put in a request that we make it an encouraged practice for external links to be more than just the raw URL, and include a proper written-out title whenever possible. For example, instead of just:</p>

<dd>Actually, the reason is that VfD is a message that will only stay for a short time, so the advantages of msg (mainly being easy to replace) don't matter much, while the disadvantages (mainly being harder to understand in wikisource) matter more. (SUBST makes a copy of the text, MSG includes it dynamically.) For other texts, we have different recommendations.

<dd><s>I just thought of a new reason. When the discussion moves from VfD to the talk page as a result of the discussion getting too long, the VfD notice is changed to add a link to the talk page telling people to discuss it there. If subst is used, this involves changing "that page" to "the talk page". If msg is used, you have to go and find the old boilerplate, paste that in and then change the words. It would be a lot easier if the message had been subst so the boilerplate was already there in the edit box. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 09:03, Feb 8, 2004 (UTC)</s>

<dd>Well, if you don't know want a rent boy is, allow me to enlighten you. A rent boy is a young, male, homosexual prostitute. The term is chiefly british, and originated in the 19th century. IIRC, the term can refer to either (a) the fact that they rent themselves out, or (b) after selling their servies, they use the money to pay their rent. It probably deserves an article on its own. Regardless, a link from the homosexuality article would seem in order. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 03:25, Feb 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why? There is a glut of links on the homosexuality page, and not all of them are "related" or justified. A single link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexology_topics.html" title="List of sexology topics">list of sexology topics</a> would cover a huge swath of them, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay-related_topics.html" title="List of gay-related topics">list of gay-related topics</a> would cover more. I fail to see how a specific link to <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frottage.html" title="Frottage">frottage</a> is necessary or appropriate on the homosexuality article. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 03:51, Feb 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree - you have a point - there are 'related articles' there that need to go, but (personally) I wouldn't cast as wide a net as you did in your first post here.

<p>What do you think about these tests for See Also links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this something that <i>should</i> be in the article, but there's already an article about it.</li>
<li>Is this something that <i>is</i> already linked in the artticle but is likely to be overlooked or is important enough to be repeated, or a significant number of other links (over 3/4ths, perhaps) are also in See Also, so this one is added also, for consistency.</li>
<li>Is it something that you'd expect to NOT see in a <i>List Of</i> article which is already linked.</li>

<p>Hi, I find myself in a sort of "revert skirmish" with a well-known vigilant Wikipedian over whether the standard section heading ==External links== should be in plural or singular when there's actually only one link in the section. My preference is the plural form, on grounds of simplicity ("effortless scalability"), but I can't seem to find any explicit style guide statement regarding this or the opposite view. Information on rules and/or precedence, anyone? --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 23:54, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You don't mean me do you? It sounds the sort of thing I'd do but I hadn't noticed I was in any revert wars over it, not purposefully anyway. I think <i>external links</i> when there is only one is incorrect and I've changed quite a few of these lately. If someone is adding new links, it is easy enough for them to add the "s" then. I think this is far preferable to having a heading which is simply false. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:48, Feb 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I guess we disagree on this one, then. No very big deal, I admit, and I do not intend to waste much time on it. I have stated my view, which is that the plural form makes for the more general term, and this is perfectly logical, as in "the number of external links is one" -- it's not as though "one" is not a number, is it? Such generalisation is found many places, so I found it the most natural form, as I noted above.

<dd>Personally I go for the plural. I don't agree that this is <i>false</i> in any logical sense. If someone asks "are there external links" and there is only one, the answer is still <i>yes</i>. Note the plural marker in the question. If there were any implicit information in the use of the plural marker, then the answer to this question would be <i>no</i>. I think if someone were to answer "no, there's only one" it would be flippantly, and they'd be seen as pedantic.</dd>

<dd>seems flawlessly correct to me, as well. I prefer the plural for the additional reason that it encourages 'wiki behavior', an 'external links' section with only one link cries out for more links, encouraging the beginning of an edit cycle.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 01:10, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So it's more a matter of grammatical agreement than of truth or falsehood.

<p>What is the difference between "disputed" and "dubious"? Why do we need both? Seems to me that "disputed" is a statement of opinion. Disputed is factual, even if one disagrees with the person disputing the statement.

However, a vast <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free (as in free speech) software</a> community exists, and by improving the interface between wikipedia and free software which is useful for testing knowledge, for applying it and for original research, we could hopefully improve the rate at which there are more and more <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negative_feedback.html" title="Negative feedback">negative feedback</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positive_feedback.html" title="Positive feedback">positive feedback</a> loops on the quality of knowledge represented in the wikipedia.</dd>
