<dd>According to recent polls most Romanians want to unite, although a minority of the Moldovan populace favors this step at the moment. You are right in 1919 the two territories were united but that only lasted until '39 when the Soviets came. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 04:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes Romania is joining the EU in '07. If Moldova were to unite with Romania after that point they would automatically become EU members. Romanian President Băsescu actually made such a proposal to the Moldovan President Voronin, but was refused. And yes, you are right, Moldova by itself has little chance of entering the EU in the next 10 years. The current Moldovan leadership though is the direct successor of the former Communist Party and a big supporter of <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldovenism.html" title="Moldovenism">Moldovenism</a> emphasizing the distinctiveness of Moldovans and they are not the biggest frineds of Romania. As for the benefits of unification, Moldova would certainly benefit more by having access to European markets and EU aid, but for Romania, its economic problems might be aggrevated initially to some extent by having to invest in consolidating Moldova's infrastructure. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 14:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If another article can be created or redirected to that covers a different meaning of "Serbo-Croatian", then a move of the language back to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Croatian_language_560d.html" title="Serbo-Croatian language">Serbo-Croatian language</a> can be justified.

<p>Sorry for being cruel; I appreciate your work, but the images in stubs are really too small to be able to display anything that fancy. It is only my opinion, of course, but it's hardly recognizable that it's the Serbian flag displayed within. I don't want to push the issue too far; people would probably give their opinion.</p>
<p>How about the "waved" version without the coat of arms? I think it would be a good compromise between "fanciness" and recognizeability. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 07:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Sorry I didn't awnser immediately, but the thing had passed out of my mind. Really I'm the last guy you should ask this: if you look at the edit text you will see &lt;!-- Idea stolen from Jcw69 page --&gt;, who had taken it, slightly modified, from <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">User:Coolcat</a>. So really the model is not my merit, but <a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">User:Jcw69</a>'s. That said, I'm sure you can assume he will be happy that yet another editor plagiarizes his model, so I think you can directly imit it, or, if you prefer, ask him.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 10:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zdravo Avdo. Iskreno da ti kazem, sumnjam da cu se vratiti u Bosnu. Bio sam vrlo mlad kad sam dosao i sad sam maltene vecinu zivota proveo ovdje. Takoder znam da stvari u Bosni, blago receno, nisu bas najbolje. Ovdje imam konkretne planove i znam kuda idem u zivotu, a da bi se sad vratio u BiH nisam siguran sta bi bilo. Gotovo svakog lijeta se vracam u Bosnu i mozda cu se nekad vratiti kad sam stariji (barem bi htio imati vikendicu negdje). Fino je ovdje u Americi; <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor_9c66.html" title="Ann Arbor">moj grad</a> je sjajan mada nema puno nasih. Ipak, u nekim vecim gradovima Sjeverne Amerike ima dosta ljudi iz nasih krajeva (npr. Chicago, Toronto, St. Louis). Za razliku od Talijana, Iraca, Svedana i ostalih, "nasi" se nikad nisu naselili u jedno specificno podrucje. Ipak, prema procjenama, u Americi ima 393,147 ljudi Hrvatskog porijekla, 156,986 ljudi Srpskog porijekla, te jos 386,582 ljudi Jugoslavenskog porijekla i jedno najmanje 100,000 ljudi porijeklom iz Bosne i Hercegovine. Svugdje mozes naci tipicne Amerikance sa prezimenima koja zavrsavaju na "ovich". <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 07:25, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the advice. I understand that some users will not change, and I am not trying to change them. I have tried to talk to one Albanian user that is accused of being a nationalist, Ferick, I have tried to see what makes him tick, what makes him do what he does, in a very frank and civilized manner. He was very hostile towards me, and I have given up on him. I know there are many Albanian users on this Wikipedia, but I have never come in direct contact with anyone except Ferick. I do not like to generalize, nationalism is a big word, in an encyclopedical sense, it's the thing that gives the right to a nation to form a country, while it usually gets mixed up with imperialism (or "big nationalism") that makes a nation want to rule another nation. Now, from what I have heard, Albanians do not have plans to rule over Serbia, they have never claimed control over Belgrade or Nis... If there are some Albanians that don't like Serbs, that doesn't make them nationalist - it makes them racist. Of course, I don't believe that all Albanians are like this, actually, I think it's only a minority, and mostly the ones that had direct experience with some Serbs, who do not accurately represent what the majority of Serbs think and believe. The majority of Serbs and Albanians do not hate each other, trust me, they have only been taught to think so. If the average Albanian got a gun and they put a Serbian 14-year old child in front of him, he would not shoot. Same thing goes for Serbs. We must release ourselved from the weight of the past, and learn how to share the Balkans, something we haven't been able to do for centuries. But, I'm optimistic, it's a new millenium, a new chance&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Guy, sorry for writing so much, but I like to talk, especially about Balkan-related topics. I'd like to hear your opinion on what I wrote, so.. write soon&#160;:)</dd>

Generally, I do not have a strong opinion on the Balkans, but I do understand nationalism and what drives it, as I am a nationalist myself. For example, I had a conversation with a Polish nationalist who believed that Bismack hated the Poles and his foreign policy was aimed against them exclusively. Being an avid historical enthusiast and coming from Eastern Europe, I completely disagreed with him. We had a pretty civil discussion but what it came down to is that Bismarck is the national boogeyman of Poland, and no amount of historical fact will persuade him otherwise because that idea is so interwoven with the "national saga" of Poland and their victimization at the hands of the Germans. When it comes to the Balkans, we are talking about a national saga that goes back to the year 1400 when Serbia fought Muslim invaders from getting a foothold in Europe. When we are talking about Serbs and Albanians, you are talking about ancestors of those people that fought at the Battle of Kosovo. Anything that has to do with today's prejudices are related with that battle and its aftermath, and has nothing to do with individuals but with the collective memory and history imposed through ethnic interpertation of events. When Ferick was talking to you, he was talking to a Serb and for him Serb has historical connotations which contradict his goals. Don't take his hostility personally. When nationalists are still unsure in their beliefs, they will subsume their entire personality into the historical memory of their ethnicity. It becomes amplified and rigid. Some people become more understanding and sure in their beliefs that they are able to have civil discussions, sometimes the rigid historical memory superimposes even into the adult life. Those people become truly dangerous and fanatical.</p>
<p>As for me, I sympathize with Serbs, if for no other reason than because of a similiar history and because Serbian partisans saved my grandparents from the Ustashe. When every other group in that region fell to fascism, the Serbs didn't. I didn't agree with the NATO bombing compaign in Kosovo and sympathize with the raw deal that Serbs have received for hundreds of years. As you might understand, when a nation loses the right to the cradle of its civilization, it strikes a deep cord with me. Anyways, I don't know specifics of what grudges are held against who for what, {I have enough problems keeping track of the grievances in the Middle East&#160;:)] but I wish your people a prosperous future and a quick adventageous solution in Kosovo and other regions.</p>
<p>P.S. Looks like I wrote a little more than you hehe.</p>

<dd>Yes, you did write a little bit more&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Well, first of all, I'd like to point out that I'm not a Serb. My ethnicity is mixed and this is why I declare myself Yugoslav, even though not many people use that term anymore. I am not a nationalist, that would be impossible in my situation.</dd>
<dd>I have always felt the weight of history in the Balkans. Nothing is simple here. The history of the region has always been very turbulent, because it was and still is the crossroads between the West and the East. Everybody wants a part of the Balkans.</dd>
<dd>As far as Kosovo is concerned, I think that Serbia does deserve it, since basically all of the Serbian monasteries are there, and it has always been the centre of the Serbian Empire. But, in light of today's situation, Kosovo must become independent. This is why: Albanians are a majority there, and are hostile towards Serbs. Most of them don't know why, they were just taught to think that way. Now, they have been asking for independence since 1981., and if they don't get it now, they'll probably never get it, because this is their best chance - Serbia has no real control over Kosovo, Milosevic made huge mistakes and basically helped the Albanians to get support from the West (and we all know who controls the show in the Balkans)... If Kosovo stays in Serbia now, the Albanians will not be happy, and there will be further conflicts. Maybe a new war. This is not what the Balkans need right now. Besides, when Kosovo becomes independent, Serbia will be in the EU faster, because Kosovo is the biggest problem of Europe, as it is the poorest region. History is weighing down the people of the Balkans. What happened, happened, nothing can be changed. Why torture the 1.5 million Albanians that want independence? Because of something that happened in 1389? Because of a few historical buildings, that probably won't be burned down if Kosovo becomes independent (If Albanians get what they want, they won't have any reasons to be angry, right?)? Yes, Kosovo is the holy land for Serbs, but why don't they go there and live there if its so important to them? There is 11 million Serbs, why don't they go to Kosovo and make up the majority so that the Albanians would be the minority? Its more a case of "inat" (i'm not sure you've heard of the word, check it out on the net). Well, sorry for not answering sooner, I was busy.</dd>

<p>Hey, not meaning to critcise you, but Kosovar Albanians do know why they have an ingrained dislike for Serbs. And it's a damn good reason; because of the way they were treated in the 90's, and because of what Serbian forces did in Kosovo during the war. I'm not trying to get into an arguement with you, but Milosevic really shot you guys in the foot as far as retaining Kosovo goes. Before he started rolling back autonomy, most Albanians probably would have been happy enough to remain part of Yugoslavia. Just look at how long it took for them to abandon peaceful resistance. It was only after Milosevic revived the spectre of Serbian Nationalism that Albanian Nationalism really got a foothold in Kosovo. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavu.leon_08c4.html" title="User:Davu.leon">Davu.leon</a> 10:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey thanks for the comment. Unfortunately I was on vacation (in Serbia and Croatia obviously) and did not have much time to respond. Anyways, "Miloš" as he was called by his buddies will forever be one of those players hidden in the mysts of the past. He played for Metz in France, I believe the only way to find out where he was born is to contact either Metz or Partizan and see what his work permit said =).

<p>Hi Avdo. Give a look at <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">WP:ADMIN</a>; as is said there, admins are normal editors that "are active and regular Wikipedians who have access to technical features that help with maintenance." (like deleting or protecting pages, or blocking editors) Believe me, it's no great deal to be an admin, and many of our best and most experienced editors are not admins. And yes, anybody can try to become an admin, but before has to pass a votation, in which all users can partecipate; see <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>. Give a look there to the questions made to the current candidates and their awnsers, and the reasons adduced for supporting or opposing; this will give you some idea of what is expected from an admin. In particular, requested things are 1) a certain level of experience, not less than 3 months and often more than 6, with a lot of edits 2) not being controversial; no edit-warring or pov-pushing, being civil, and possibly having no blocks 3) good quality edits and especially to interact with other editors. Also one should consider that if you edit on certain controversial topics, like the Balkans, its much harder to become an admin than if you occupy yourself of american telefilms or French municipalities. For this there are so few Balkan admins, even if there are 1000 admins. For example, I don't believe there is any Serbian or Bosnian or Macedonian or Albanian or Greek or Bulgarian admin; this is generally for encroaching national vetos at the admin votations. Hope what I told you helps, and if you have anything else to ask, don't take problems asking!

<p>Honestly, thinking about this now that I'm actually awake, I think a better solution would be to do something like what <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> does; they have the main map only on one article. It's very large and clutters up the monitor on other pages, especially for people with smaller monitors. It's also not clear how exactly it relates to each of the individual articles.

<p>Hi Avdo, sorry for not replying to your earlier message; I'm fairly busy these days.</p>
<p>Heck people, do you really have to quarrel about so ephemeric things? Did you finally arrive at a consensus—seems so, but did it have to make it to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>? Panonian does have a too short nerves on occasion—he even admitted it a couple of times.</p>
<p>On to the subject matter: I think 300px presents a reasonable compromise between readability and size. A scalable map of Serbian municipalities can be found at <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/uploads/dokumenti/teritorijalna_podela.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/uploads/dokumenti/teritorijalna_podela.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/uploads/dokumenti/teritorijalna_podela.pdf</a>, although I don't know how to extract the vector image—some PDF-decompiling tool? It contains only the municipality borders though. Panonian has a pdf with (early) census results, containing also the list of settlements, which I plan to use to replace current <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_in_Serbia_a352.html" title="List of places in Serbia">List of places in Serbia</a>. I don't know about any detailed map with settlement locations though. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:37, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>E Dujo, nisu ono što sam ti poslao "(early) census results" već konačni i zvanični.

Ja lično nemam vremena da uzimam skrinšotove, jer imam druga posla trenutno, inače da li možda imaš mapu opštine Medveđa sa ucrtanim svim naseljima, jer hoću da napravim etničku mapu te opštine, ali nemam od cega da je nacrtam? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 01:36, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I još nešto, ako već mape praviš od ovog PDF dokumenta sa Dujinog linka kako ćeš napraviti mapu naselja u svim opštinama, kad u tom dokumentu nema ucrtanih naselja?

<dd>Hm, prema dokumentu sa popisa stanovništva, u opštini Medveđa treba da ima 44 naselja, a na tvojoj mapi ima samo 13.

<dd>Pa ta naselja kod Pančeva se obično nazivaju zaseoci i klasifikuju kao deo većih naselja. Međutim u opštini Medveđa zvanično postoji upravo 44 naselja a ne zaseoka. Izgleda da su na toj mapi koju si ti našao prikazali samo veća naselja, ali bi meni trebala detaljna mapa koja pokazuje sva naselja, jer ja imam podatke o etničkom sastavu svakog od ta 44 naselja, pa bih da nacrtam etničku kartu koja to ilustruje. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ma dobro nema veze, pitao sam ako slučajno imaš takvu mapu, ako nemaš, ne moraš je sad tražiti, naći će se valjda jednom. E da, samo u vezi članka Palić: u taj infobox se obično stavlja slika panorame grada (kao na primer u članku <a href="../../../n/i/%C5%A1/Ni%C5%A1.html" title="Niš">Niš</a>. Mislim da je glupo staviti sliku samo jednog objekta u gradu ili jezera. Dok ne budemo imali sliku panorame, mislim da one dve slike treba držati izvan infoboxa. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>O što vas volim kad pričate na dve strane, ne može čovek da se uključi...</p>
<p>Ja pravim bazu podataka o naseljima od onog što mi je poslao Panonian (i još par izvora). Kvaka je što je za veliki broj mesta (oko 500) potreban "disambiguation" pošto se imena ponavljaju: ima šurnaest Kamenica, Leskovaca, Brezovaca, Novih Sela itd, a da ne pričam o "disambiguation-u" sa susednim državama (za koje i ne znam). To će biti gotovo za par dana pa ću vas uputiti na listu. Dotle, slobodno pravi(te) mape, samo što će biti problem što se puno vukojebina vodi kao naselje a nema ih na kartama. Ja koristim <a href="http://www.earthsearch.net/intSearch.php" class="external text" title="http://www.earthsearch.net/intSearch.php" rel="nofollow">ovaj sajt</a> za lokaciju koordinata, samo što su mu mape loše. <a href="http://www.flashearth.com" class="external free" title="http://www.flashearth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flashearth.com</a> ima najbolje mape. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 14:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reason why I don't want to edit, because i know these templates are sensitive and I'm not such a expert for them. Novi Sad and Petrovaradin doesn't have coat of arms, and that map you created is a map of "Novi Sad-Grad" or "City of Novi Sad" and you divided City of Novi Sad into two municipalities, Novi Sad municipality and Petrovaradin (see one again <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Novi_Sad_d5ab.html" title="Politics of Novi Sad">Politics of Novi Sad</a>, if you don't believe me). Cities, towns and villages doesn't have it own coat of arms, municipalities and cities with city status have.

<p>Beograd je ogroman i tehnički je veoma teško (ako ne i nemoguće) da napraviš mapu celog Beograda gde će se videti sva naselja. Čak i ako je napraviš ta mapa bi bila ogromna i teško upotrebljiva na Vikipediji. Dakle, najbolje napravi za svaku beogradsku opštinu posebno. A što se manjih opština tiče, ubaci njihove nazive posebno (u legendu pored mape). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 13:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am working on expanding articles about Yugoslavia in the Hebrew wiki.</p>
<p>Currently, the main source for information is the English wiki.</p>
<p>Do you think the articles about Yugoslavia in English wiki are reliable and balanced? Are there disputed parts of the articles that better not be translated? I rather not to say anything about a sensitive issue then writing incorrect claims. (I'll start with the article "Yugoslavia" and the articles about Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia).</p>

<p>Now I understand. You are an older user. I apologize if I have ever insulted you. I, myself, am 20 years old, fairly young. Thank you for explaining, a lot of things make more sense. However, I do not understand why you support that every ethnicity has their own nationalistic symbol if you declare yourself to be a Yugoslav. I know that being a Yugoslav does not imply that you are "Yugoslavian" and "pro-SFRJ" but it does seem to be somewhat contrary.

<p><br />
Ooh, likewise! I love discussing the Balkan-question (as I like to call it), just as you do. I tend not to call myself "Yugoslav" but rather use hyphenated (ex: Serbo-Croat) terms (I just have a problem with entities that do not exist anymore [however great they were] because if someone called themselves "Soviet" I would feel the need to probe further).</p>
<p>You mentioned that "problem with most people from the Balkans is that it is very hard to find something to unite us", however, the problem is not FINDING something to unite us but RECOGNIZING the uniting traits that already exist! The most prominent one being LANGUAGE! I find the quest to distance and divide our various "dialects" and turn them into different languages absolutely absurd. Other uniting traits would be common history throughout various points in time (obviously there were many conflicts, but many do not realize the times we worked together!!!), common love for similar music, food, and entertainment, and even something as obvious as common geographical location! *Sigh... but it is, as you say "so easy to turn us against each other", because people let their passions get the best of them, while listening to fabricated lies and being manipulated by those with greater political agendas (or those who simply do not know any better.. such as certain wiki users who will remain unnamed heh)...</p>
<p>This is seriously enough to make me cry...</p>
<p>Socialist Yugo had its ups but it also had its downs (as any socialist country would), and I learned this through many conversations with my parents who both loved the country and disliked certain aspects to it. I completely agree with you when you say that stifling nationalism led to its outburst in the '90s. That was a very BIG mistake.... But one cannot ignore other factors that led to the dissolution of Yugo (I say that with such nostalgia even though I was still fairly young when war broke out hehe) which is a completely different topic.</p>
<p>However, I DO think the "C-C-C-C symbol" is a nationalistic symbol, yet NOT in a negative or aggressive manner (as some seem to imply)! It is simply a nationalistic symbol in the sense that a flag might be (therefore, not threatening, but meant to unite). [I have heard the song "CCCC" with Corba, Bajaga etc. and I think such use of the term might make one feel better and not feel so vulnerable, especially during the bombing of '99.] Once again, I agree with you when you say that nationalism is completely appropriate when used in a proper and unthreatening context, such as for unity, but definitely not for aggression towards another nation/ethnicity.</p>
<p>I also (having read your posts on your talk page) have a similar outlook on the situation in Kosovo. Yes, I do believe that under different circumstances, given the abundant history stored in the province, it should remain in Serbia. However, those circumstances are not present, and the benefits of independence outweigh the disadvantages. Currently, the only benefit from not separating seems to be that some Serbs will be pleased, that's IT! Their lives will not change for the better! However, the disadvantages are huge!</p>
<p>You put it VERY well when you said: "Kosovo stays in Serbia now, the Albanians will not be happy, and there will be further conflicts. Maybe a new war. This is not what the Balkans need right now. Besides, when Kosovo becomes independent, Serbia will be in the EU faster, because Kosovo is the biggest problem of Europe, as it is the poorest region. History is weighing down the people of the Balkans. What happened, happened, nothing can be changed. Why torture the 1.5 million Albanians that want independence? Because of something that happened in 1389?..." etc.</p>
<p>I must go now, but would love to talk on the subject further. Bye bye!&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 05:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</p>

<dd>Helloo&#160;:) I'll try not to give mile-long replies heh. Anyway, you disagreed with me saying that the only benefit of not separating was some pleased Serbs, yet your post only reaffirmed this very idea! You said your friends "<i>passionately defend the point of view that Kosovo was, is, and always should be a part (if not the heart) of Serbia</i>", that "<i>Serbs are the most history-conscious people in the world, and Kosovo is a part of their identity</i>", and that they are really fighting for "<i>the Kosovo that is in (their) minds</i>". Does this not prove that these Serbs are really fighting to keep Kosovo for their own satisfaction, while disregarding the financial difficulties of maintaining Kosovo, the fact that many people are suffering there (due to ethnic tension that has a good chance of minimizing with independence), and other downsides. I, on the other hand, DO know Serbs who do not "passionately defend" Kosovo's staying in Serbia because it "should be there" and it is Serbia's "heart" etc., including family members and other acquaintances. They realize the benefits of separation and therefore endorse it, while still recognizing the unfairness of the circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You mentioned that "<i>Serbs are going to go through a huge identity crisis when that happens</i>". Yes, but only some. And that is a shame, because those people have decided to identify themselves with a region (regardless of history etc.), rather than focusing on what makes them THEM. This history will not disappear suddenly because of altered political boundaries. It will not be forgotten. In fact, it has a greater chance of being preserved due to lowered tensions. I pity those people who will go through an identity crisis if independence is achieved. They should really know better, put their egos on hold, realize the benefits, and be happy that the issue has finally been resolved... I'm not being cold hearted when I say this, I am simply looking out for the best interests of both parties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also wish that Serbs and Albanians could get a fresh start... give that overdue apology. It's amazing how many lives would improve with such a union.... But sadly, given the fact of life that there are simply more ignorant than reasonable people in the world, this seems unlikely. One must stay positive though, eh? And perhaps, get that charity going to start things off&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 05:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</dd>

Thanks a lot!&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 01:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hehe, I removed the Hague trivia only to find that some pesky editor had edited the page while I was in the process&#160;:P <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 04:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Awesome work! Thanks so much&#160;:) I'm temporarily happy again hehe. I have not seen the movie yet (sadly) but I have sure heard of it plenntttyyy, meaning that it is very likely to be notable among the Yugo public, even if it has won no awards. You'll notice that Mi Nismo Andjeli (love that movie) won no awards (that I'm aware of), but nonetheless it is notable because it was:
<ul>
<li>Praised by critics for its inventive direction, tight editing, urban humour, &amp; plenty of pop culture references</li>
<li>Achieved great commercial success, &amp; later cult status</li>
<li>One of most popular films of 1990s in the region of former Yugoslavia</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So if anything similar applies to Balkan Express, feel free to add it&#160;:) Thanks again!!! <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 07:38, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although you are right that I should have checked the talk page, you should not have called the edit "vandalism" in your edit summary. That is what triggered me to revert. It was not vandalism, the editor was at most misinformed (as I was). If you would have called it "reverting to consensus" or something like that, I <i>would</i> have checked the talk page before changing it back.

<p>Hello. I do like the template, a lot. Very good graphically and yes it expresses the view I hold strongly. However, if you don't like me using it, that's fine. I don't think it is a big deal to make something myself, linking to the same article. Just out of curiosity, why do you think that Montenegrin independence ideologically clashes with Brotherhood and Unity? I don't mean to get into big political arguments here, but, Brotherhood and Unity, as far as I remember, and I lived through a bit of that period as an adult, basically means supporting the idea of federal Yugoslavia, from Triglav to Djevdjelija. Independent Montenegro, on the other hand, was reconstituted primarily as a response agains Great Serbian idea and ideology, which also destroyed Yugoslavia as a country. If, by some miracle, Yugoslavia resurects, I am sure 99% of Montenegrins would gladly join.</p>
<p>Lastly, I never had the template "user supports Montenegrin Independence" on my page, although, yes I was overjoyed and still am very proud of independent Montenegro. You can easily check that by viewing the history of the page. You've must come to your conclusion by reading a comment from Pax (a.k.a Pixi&#160;:-) Perfect example of how quick to judge and at the same time slack we Yugoslavs are.

<dd>A true Yugoslav idea will make Greater Serbia, Greater Croatia and other nazis uncomfortable for a long, long time to come. That's why they are trying to compromise it, highjack it and misinterpret it. As far as Montenegrins go, if you cannot tell them apart, it probably shows that you don't know enough to tell them apart. Exactly the reason I join Wikipedia. I think I fell in love with the template, you might have created a monster&#160;:-) BTW, you do sound a bit like Pixi&#160;;-) Regards, <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomisan_7c35.html" title="User:Momisan">Momisan</a> 00:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You see, I agreed with everything you said, until the last statement that Serbia&amp;Montenegro were the last hope for Yugoslavia. My strong belief is that Montenegro had to separate, exactly so that the idea that ultimately destroyed Yugoslavia, Greater Serbian one, can be burried. Only then, there is a hope we will one day reunite, if Serbia ever comes to their senses. We both want Yugoslavia and we both agree that its national solution was the best for us. The crucial problem with Montenegro and Montenegrins in its union with Serbia was that its identity, culture and language was denied, like you just did. And most of the people I know, do it because they really don't know enough about it. I guess to truly understand what I am talking about, you would have to walk in our shoes. Anyway, I think we agree on the important points, i.e. looking ahead. Regards, <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomisan_7c35.html" title="User:Momisan">Momisan</a> 01:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bože pravde. In answer to your query, I suppose the simplest way to explain such an apparent contradiction in my list of who I admire, is that I am a bit wierd:) which is true, but not the only reason. When I added him to that list I was under the impression that all he had done was defend his homeland and his people, and nothing more. However, after finding out about his crimes, my high opinion about him has dropped dramatically. But at the time I actually started to believe his crimes, I was involved in a dispute with some other editors (which you may have noticed from reading my talk page), and I thought if I removed him from my list, some peopel may think that I'm trying to "hide" or "cover up" something. The dispute has died down now, and I'll be removing him soon. Thank you for the having the courtesy to ask about it, instead of just jumping straight in and labeling me as some wild nationalist.

<p>Dear Bože pravde, I was not referring to the discussion of the color, but to the discussion about whether to include Serbia at all in a map of Kosovo. This map, showing a part of Serbia was the compromise we reached. For more info, please see the arbitration case regarding the Kosovo articles.

<dd>Thanks for understanding. The map of the article one of the reasons we ended up at arbitration in the first place, so that is why I feel it is important to stick with the compromise, to prevent future escalation of the difficulties surrounding this article.
