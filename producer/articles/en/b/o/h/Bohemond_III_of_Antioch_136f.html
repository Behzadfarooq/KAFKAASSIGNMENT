<p>Bohemond's father was killed at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Inab_866f.html" title="Battle of Inab">Battle of Inab</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/4/1149.html" title="1149">1149</a>, and his mother ruled as regent until he was old enough to rule on his own. Constance, however, married a second time, to <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raynald_of_Chatillon_304c.html" title="Raynald of Chatillon">Raynald of Chatillon</a>, who ruled as Prince of Antioch until being taken captive and imprisoned in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleppo.html" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/6/1160.html" title="1160">1160</a> (he remained there until <a href="../../../1/1/7/1176.html" title="1176">1176</a>). Bohemond was by now of legal age to succeed, but Constance refused; King <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Baldwin III of Jerusalem">Baldwin III of Jerusalem</a> intervened and declared Bohemond ruler of the principality. In 1163 Constance asked the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Kingdom_of_Cilicia_ea36.html" title="Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia">Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia</a> for aid in order to maintain her rule; the citizens of Antioch then rioted and exiled her. She died later that year, allowing Bohemond to take full control.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/6/1164.html" title="1164">1164</a>, Bohemond and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_III_of_Tripoli_5154.html" title="Raymond III of Tripoli">Raymond III of Tripoli</a> marched out to relieve <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harim.html" title="Harim">Harim</a>, under siege from <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nur_ad-Din_1ec9.html" title="Nur ad-Din">Nur ad-Din</a>, but when Nur ad-Din retreated Bohemond led a charge against him. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Harim_3df3.html" title="Battle of Harim">ensuing battle</a> was a disaster and both Bohemond and Raymond were taken prisoner. King <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalric_I_of_Jerusalem_cc0c.html" title="Amalric I of Jerusalem">Amalric I of Jerusalem</a> hastened back from his invasion of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to take control of the regency of Antioch; Bohemond was freed, for a large ransom, in <a href="../../../1/1/6/1165.html" title="1165">1165</a> with the intervention of Amalric and <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_emperor.html" title="Byzantine emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_I_Comnenus_fd09.html" title="Manuel I Comnenus">Manuel I Comnenus</a>, his nominal overlord; Manuel was also his brother-in-law, as he was married to Bohemond's sister <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_of_Antioch_4767.html" title="Maria of Antioch">Maria of Antioch</a>. Nur ad-Din was always wary of Byzantine intervention in Syria, which may explain his quick release of Bohemond. Bohemond then visited Manuel in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, where he agreed to re-establish a <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Antioch_f557.html" title="Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch">Greek Patriarch</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>, Athanasius II. The <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Patriarch_of_Antioch_68fa.html" title="Latin Patriarch of Antioch">Latin Patriarch</a>, Aimery of Limoges, protested this and imposed an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdict.html" title="Interdict">interdict</a> on the city. He did not return until Athanasius died in <a href="../../../1/1/7/1170.html" title="1170">1170</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/6/1166.html" title="1166">1166</a> the future emperor <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andronicus_I_Comnenus_7e00.html" title="Andronicus I Comnenus">Andronicus Comnenus</a>, then only governor of Cilicia, arrived in Antioch, having heard of the beauty of Bohemond's sister Philippa. Their subsequent affair angered both Bohemond and Manuel, as Philippa was the sister of Manuel's wife and thus the relationship was considered <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incestuous</a> by the church. Andronicus was forced to flee to Jerusalem, where he also seduced Queen <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodora_Comnena_a10d.html" title="Theodora Comnena">Theodora Comnena</a>, an even closer relative.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/7/1172.html" title="1172">1172</a> Bohemond invaded <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Kingdom_of_Cilicia_ea36.html" title="Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia">Armenia</a>, in response to <a href="../../../m/l/e/Mleh_of_Armenia_d9c4.html" title="Mleh of Armenia">Mleh of Armenia</a>'s alliance with Nur ad-Din. In <a href="../../../1/1/7/1177.html" title="1177">1177</a>, along with Raymond III and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip%2C_Count_of_Flanders_d026.html" title="Philip, Count of Flanders">Philip, Count of Flanders</a>, who had arrived on <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>, Bohemond besieged Harim, but they could not recapture it and the siege was abandoned.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/8/1180.html" title="1180">1180</a> Bohemond and Raymond attempted to intervene in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem_188c.html" title="Kingdom of Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>, which was at the time ruled by their kinsman <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_IV_of_Jerusalem_c609.html" title="Baldwin IV of Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a>, a <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">leper</a>. Because Baldwin could have no heirs, it was vital that his sister <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibylla_of_Jerusalem_b1ad.html" title="Sibylla of Jerusalem">Sibylla</a> be married to a suitable candidate for the kingship. After the death of her first husband, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Montferrat%2C_Count_of_Jaffa_and_Ascalon_5ae4.html" title="William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon">William of Montferrat</a>, Baldwin had been trying to negotiate another foreign marriage for her. Raymond and Bohemond, both firsts cousin of Baldwin and Sibylla, brought their forces into the kingdom with the intention of marrying her to one of their supporters, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_of_Ibelin_a22a.html" title="Baldwin of Ibelin">Baldwin of Ibelin</a>. The king pre-empted them by marrying her off to <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_of_Lusignan_4dc1.html" title="Guy of Lusignan">Guy of Lusignan</a>.</p>

<p>Around this time Bohemond left his wife Theodora, a niece of the recently-deceased Emperor Manuel, and married a woman named Sibylla, "who had the reputation of practicing evil arts" according to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Tyre_c43c.html" title="William of Tyre">William of Tyre</a>. He was excommunicated by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Alexander_III_e24c.html" title="Pope Alexander III">Pope Alexander III</a>, and Antioch was placed under an interdict, but "to this...he paid slight attention. On the contrary, he continued on his wicked course with redoubled energy." He imprisoned Patriarch Aimery and other bishops and looted their churches. Opposition to Bohemond was led by Reynald Masoir. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_Heraclius_of_Jerusalem_da43.html" title="Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem">Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem</a> was sent to mediate in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1181.html" title="1181">1181</a>, with Raynald of Chatillon, Raymond III of Tripoli, <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_of_Toroga_71bb.html" title="Arnold of Toroga">Arnold of Toroga</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_des_Moulins_70b0.html" title="Roger des Moulins">Roger des Moulins</a>, but Bohemond refused to acquiesce, and expelled the mediators as well as a number of his own nobles.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/8/1183.html" title="1183">1183</a> Antioch was harassed by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saladin.html" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, with whom Bohemond then negotiated a peace treaty. He also sold <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarsus_%28city%29.html" title="Tarsus (city)">Tarsus</a> to <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruben_III_of_Armenia_ce5e.html" title="Ruben III of Armenia">Ruben III of Armenia</a>, in order to make Antioch more easily defensible. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, Baldwin IV was becoming more and more incapacitated, and Raymond III had Sibylla's son from her first marriage, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_V_of_Jerusalem_d68d.html" title="Baldwin V of Jerusalem">Baldwin V</a>, crowned co-king. He was supported in this by the nobles' party, including Bohemond. However, Baldwin IV died in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1185.html" title="1185">1185</a> and Baldwin V died as a child soon afterwards. Bohemond, Raymond, and the nobles could not prevent Guy and Sibylla from succeeding to the throne in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1186.html" title="1186">1186</a>. Their reign was disastrous. The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem_188c.html" title="Kingdom of Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> was all but destroyed by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saladin.html" title="Saladin">Saladin</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hattin_9522.html" title="Battle of Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1187.html" title="1187">1187</a>; Bohemond was not present, but his son Raymond was in the vanguard and escaped with Raymond of Tripoli. Saladin invaded Antioch afterwards, but Bohemond was able to defend his territory with help from a <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicilian</a> fleet. Raymond of Tripoli died soon after Hattin, and had named Bohemond's elder son Raymond as his successor, but Bohemond ignored this and instead installed his second son, <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemond_IV_of_Antioch_228b.html" title="Bohemond IV of Antioch">Bohemond IV</a>, as count.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/9/1190.html" title="1190">1190</a> Bohemond met the remnants of the German contingent arriving on the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Crusade_21bd.html" title="Third Crusade">Third Crusade</a>; <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_b965.html" title="Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, had died on the way and some of his remains were buried in Antioch. He otherwise played little role in the crusade, preferring to remain neutral to avoid provoking Saladin. In <a href="../../../1/1/9/1194.html" title="1194">1194</a> Bohemond was captured by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_II_of_Armenia_4de8.html" title="Leo II of Armenia">Leo II of Armenia</a>. Leo had seized the castle of <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagras.html" title="Bagras">Bagras</a>, on the northern border of Antioch, which had been captured by Saladin in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1189.html" title="1189">1189</a>. Bohemond and the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_f717.html" title="Knights Templar">Knights Templar</a>, its original owners, demanded its return. Leo lured Bohemond to Bagras under pretense of a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parley.html" title="Parley">parley</a>, captured him, and imprisoned him in <a href="../../../k/o/z/Kozan%2C_Adana_6e3b.html" title="Kozan, Adana">Sis</a>. Under duress, Bohemond was compelled to cede the Principality to Leo. Bohemond was subsequently released through the mediation of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_Champagne_51b5.html" title="Henry II of Champagne">Henry II of Champagne</a>, King of Jerusalem, but was forced to abandon all claims to the suzerainity of Armenia. In addition, the two entered into a marital alliance in <a href="../../../1/1/9/1195.html" title="1195">1195</a>: Bohemond's son Raymond married Alice of Armenia, the daughter of Leo's brother Ruben III.</p>
<p>Bohemond died in 1201, and the succession was disputed between his son Bohemond IV and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond-Roupen_of_Antioch_3650.html" title="Raymond-Roupen of Antioch">Raymond-Roupen</a>, son of Raymond and Alice.</p>
