<p>Bohemians, in the classical sense, were not as widespread as this article suggests. It may not have been an exclusively European phenomenon, but it was to a far greater extent than indicated. Areas such as Greenwich Village and the lower East Side in New York would be more correctly identified with beat poets. Furthermore, true bohemians were largely all dead by around the 1930s (Patrick Leigh Fermor, A Time Of Gifts) - WWI symbolised their death, in a sense. Therfore it's fair to dispute the dates suggested by the article as well as the suggested locations.</p>

<p>"The term carries a connotation of arcane enlightenment (the opposite of 'Philistines'), and also carries a less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness with personal Bohemians were often associated with drugs and self-induced poverty." I haven't edited it because I'm not sure what the author intended, but I would suggest replacing it with "The term carries a connotation of arcane enlightenment (the opposite of 'Philistines'), and also carries a less frequently intended, pejorative connotation. Bohemians were often associated with drugs and self-induced poverty."</p>

<p>I apologize if my contributions have not been well sourced enough. I would note that in general, this article is not all that well cited...</p>
<p>I have received criticism on my personal talk page that "Many of your recent edits on this article smack of POV and original research." I take such matters very seriously. I am trying to do my best here, so let's review my three main contributions in detail:</p>
<p>1. Bohemian communities. I admit my contributions there are unsourced. So is <i>every other contribution</i> in those sections. So, there is a mess to clean up. On the other hand, arguing that Eugene, Oregon has Bohemian characteristics starts to border on common knowledge in my view.</p>
<p>2. Rainbow gathering. I did not cite this because the linked Wikipedia article is well-sourced. I have now added the link to Niman, a credible academic ethnography and a perfect "secondary source."</p>
<p>3. Gentrification. I did not cite this because the linked Wikipedia article is well sourced.</p>
<p>Perhaps more experienced editors can help me understand how this works better. I agree that Wikipedia cannot be a mass of incestuous self-citation. But when I point to an article that in turn contains numerous, well-sourced, peer-reviewed and academic-house-published citations - secondary sources in the best sense - isn't it a bit of a waste to have to copy them now here (as I have done?)</p>
<p>I'm a bit surprised that there is any criticism at all around the absolute and incontrovertible fact that Bohemian communities get gentrified. To suggest that this is POV indicates that someone is not familiar with the <i>extensive</i> literature on gentrification. I've both experienced it personally and read detailed analyses of it. Can anyone provide countervailing evidence? I think the burden is now on those who disagree with the inclusion. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_T._Betz_d167.html" title="User:Charles T.

<dd>It may seem like common knowledge, but I'm sure there are some out there who don't look it as open-and-shut as you are. And the phrasing of your points is the biggest problem here. I think you can prove your points without much of a problem, but you're using words like "obviously," which have the effect of sounding like opinion and closing the door to any outside thought. In effect, it sounds like you're talking down to laymen. I don't mean this to sound like a jerk, but please keep in mind that what may seem clear to you isn't clear to everyone. - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_Fig_43b2.html" title="User:Stick Fig">Stick Fig</a> 23:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stop being such a crybaby. Are you incapable of forming your own opinion? Apparently so! Have you made it your personal business to prevent others from forming their own opinions? Apparently so! I couldn't give two flying f-cks if Brooks is a "notable New York Times columnist". Is there such a thing? Tell me why I should respect any newspaper, let alone the New York Times, let alone some pitiful little pipsqueak who has a damn column that only a bunch of sap-headed dilettantes with far more money than sense would ever bother to read.</p>
<p>His book was a bestseller, was it? You're not trying too hard to convince me he's worth paying any attention to, comrade.</p>
<p>Please, just do the right thing. All opinions are equally worthless. The random musings of a NYT halfwit are worth no more than the random musings of some other damn halfwit. Just let it go. People should be able to read a page without having the opinions of (more often than not) self-appointed authorities stuffed down their throats.</p>
<p>If you dare to put his nonsense back up, I'm going to go through EVERY article on bohemianism I can find, and quote every stupid journalist who ever uttered two words about it.</p>
<p>Now shut up and do something more important with your life. - EZRA.</p>

<dd>A subjective concept such as "Bohemianism" is the sum total of various opinions, having no grounding in anything other than the literary and social commentary tradition.

<p>Neither do I appreciate your tone, comrade. "All opinions are not created equal"? Very profound, dear boy. What did I say? All opinions are equally worthless. There is no such thing as a "qualified" opinion! Get that through your skull. Your "reasoning", that is, your boyfriend Brooks works for the NYT (Ooh!) is utterly pathetic. You are a pinhead, if you were employed by the NYT, what would that make you? A pinhead who works for the NYT.</p>
<p>Please, like I already said, I will read every essay every half-wit ever wrote that has any mention whatsoever of anything at all related to "bohemianism".</p>
<p>Can I find someone to back me in my opinions that some idiot who works for the NYT is still an idiot? Yes. Probably billions of people. Shall I get them all to post on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Why not post the opinions of some legitimate bohemians? I know plenty of them! Or are only the opinions of high-hat Ivy-League morons of any value to you? If so, please, have a shred of self-respect.</p>

<dd>Folks, I need help here. This article is peripheral to my core concerns. If everyone else is OK with this person's unjustified deletion of what I think is an appropriate and interesting mention, then fine. But please consider his abuse and irrationality and realize he may randomly come after your work next. I think he needs to learn that Wikipedia is a community effort, or take his act elsewhere.

<p>Keep the peace, y'all. I tend to agree with Charles on this particular case, simply because it's analysis that's useful to the article, and it isn't like it's untrue. I live in the Ghent area of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk%2C_Virginia_e3c8.html" title="Norfolk, Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, and in many ways, it's clear the point that Brooks is getting at just by looking at my own city. Without trying to be derogatory here, it's clearly been influenced by bohemianism but gentrified to the point that the people that actually live there are upper class. Having also lived in a <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_towns.html" title="College towns">college town</a> in the past, the example is clear there, too. Even so, we try to avoid original research on the site.</p>
<p>In this specific case, considering that this analysis is coming from a well-known New York Times columnist and not an obscure blogger, I think we're relatively safe regarding the notability of the sourced argument. If you would like to find an equally notable counter-argument for balance, feel free. I don't think anyone is against that. Our goal is to acheive balance and portray a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. That doesn't prevent us from running analysis; it just means that we don't let the analysis take over the article.</p>
<p>If you'd like to continue this argument, Ezra, you may want to consider registering an account with Wikipedia as well as signing your posts using four tildes.
