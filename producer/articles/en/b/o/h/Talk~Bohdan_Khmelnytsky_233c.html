<p>Do not change correct English usage into Ukrainian names. Some of names can be under dispute, of course.</p>
<p>Uprising was not against Polish magnates: Wisniowiecki was Ukrainian magnate, many others were also Ukrainian magnates. One can argue that it wasn't against Poland, since in beginning Chmielnicki considered himself subject of Polish king. But it evolved into uprising against Poland. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">szopen</a></p>
<p><br />
Chmielnicki's uprosing was in fact a civil war. Chmielnicki was an ethnic Pole as well as many Cossacks and peasants by his side. In contrary Wisniowiecki was Ruthenian (Ukrainians if you prefer) as well as majority of his soldiers. In fact it was a war between two elites of Ukraine: actual nobles (in majority Ruthenians) and potential nobility (Cossakcs). Unfortunalelly, the popular view (in Poland and in Ukraine) of history of these events is full of nationalistic and class mithology.</p>

<p>'This view however is on the far side of radical nationalism rather than unprejudiced'</p>
<p>A far side is a bit too far I think. I agree with nationalism, but you make it sound like ultra-propaganda...</p>
<p>Second. What u say here about Ukrainian magnats...well, lets face it, they spoke Polish, converted to catholiciism - most of them embraced the Polish culture. Which is not to say that majority of the peasantry wasnt Ukrainian.</p>
<p>I agree with rest of what you say...curse those stupid nobles for destroying the PLN with their petty nationalism, yes... --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotrus</a> 19:14, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like Wiki will have to think of a way to settle nationalistic disputes. In Russia, they taught me that it was a unification of Ukraine and Russia with the help of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, not annexation by Russia&#160;:). I guess, Ukraine is now revising its history to match it with its current ideology (who knows if it's right or wrong). Though it's funny how they never tried to sanctify the White Army in Russia, for example. They have been fighting with the evil Bolsheviks, haven't they? Check out my article on Ivan Mazepa, I hope you won't find it offensive.</p>

<p><i>estimates range from a minimum 100,000 to over half a million Jews killed.</i></p>
<p>That estimate seems exaggerated, since according to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>, there were 750 000 Jews in the world at the time, with about 450 000 in Poland. Even the biggest estimates out there are "100 000 to 200 000", so that seems more accurate to me. Also it should be noted that not all of those were killed, some died of diseases and of imprisonment by the invading Tatars. So after my revision:</p>
<p><i>The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes deaths from diseases and Tatar imprisonment.</i></p>
<p>In no way is this intented to diminish the tragedy which occurred, but the numbers have to adhere to facts and make sense.</p>

<dd>I think there wasn't a concept of nation the way we have today, at least among the peasantry. Many people described themselves as "local" or "orthodox". On the other hand, many commonwealth nobles consciously changed their names from Ukrainian to Polish (or was it just from Cyrillic to Latin spelling?) to fit in with mainstream society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't read anywhere that Khmelnytsky said what his nationality was. <i>Ruthenian</i> might be considered a more inclusive term by some. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-03-8&#160;16:12&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<p>I object to the phrase "the Jews" in the following sentance:</p>
<p><i>"The magnates sold and leased certain privileges to the Jews for a lump sum and, while enjoying themselves at their courts, left it to the Jewish leaseholders and collectors to become objects of hatred to the oppressed and long-suffering peasants."</i></p>
<p>"The Jews" did not form a unit to which privileges (or anything else) could be sold or leased. The phrase should be modified to reflect the specific group to whom the author refers, or at least to reflect that only a minority of Jews participated in this process. The current usage is offensive. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Holland_3403.html" title="User:Adam Holland">Adam Holland</a> 18:49, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The statement is accurate. Everything in the 1600s was strictly divided along religious/racial lines. Special laws applied to "The Jews" as a unit. For example, it was illegal for Jews to own land. But the Polish nobilty exploited everyone to the hilt, so they encouraged Jewish enterpreneurs to lease land under very difficult terms that made it almost impossible to profit without abusing the peasant population. According to Subtelny, in 1616 more than 50% of Polish crown lands in Ukraine were leased out to Jewish enterpreneurs.</p>

<p>Romanian sources mention Timofei (spelling?), a second son to Bohdan (he was important for certain events in Romanian history - see <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasile_Lupu_5a94.html" title="Vasile Lupu">Vasile Lupu</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bohdan's other son... and his right hand man was named Tymosh (full name Tymoshenko or Tymofii). Tymosh married the Moldavian Hospodar Lupu's daughter in June 1652 in order to seal an alliance between Cossackdom and Moldavia. He was wounded by a cannonball during a campaign September 1653 and died of gangrene several days later. Earlier in June 1651 his father Hetman Bohdan suspected that his 2nd wife, of Polish origin, was cheating on him. He wrote Tymosh a letter ordering him to investigate and to hang the woman if charges true. Under torture the truth came out and Tymosh hung 6 people, including Bohdan's adulterous wife and her mother. The Hetman grieved deeply, but within a few years married for the 3rd time... deliberately choosing a Ukrainian Cossack widow. (Widows were very common in those times).</p>
<p>The definitive Ukrainian history was written by Professor <a href="../../../m/y/k/Mykhailo_Hrushevsky_ae49.html" title="Mykhailo Hrushevsky">Mykhailo Hrushevsky</a> (1866-1934). He briefly became Ukaine's president in 1918. The work is 11 volumes and about 7,000 pages. Several volumes have been translated into English. Anyone unfamiliar with this work cannot seriously comment on the history of Ukraine. Khemlnytsky hosted foreign envoys and diplomats almost daily. All political eyes in EU were upon him... since he stood at the nexus of the conflict between Catholicism/Orthodoxy and Christianity/Islam. Hrushevsky's history is primarily based on 1000s of [[Image:letters written by diplomats and preserved in EU archives.</p>
<p>Also, the discussion about whether Bohdan was Ukrainian or Polish is laughable. Today in Ukraine the Polish population might be 1-2% because Stalin forcibly evicted all ethnic Poles from West Ukraine. The idea that the UA government would put a Polish national on their 5 hryvnia note is nonsensical. Also, Poles are Catholic while Cossackdom was near universally Orthodox.]]</p>

<p>However much he may not be liked, it cannot be disputed that he was an actual leader. He wasn't a "so-called" leader and so I'm going to remove the words "so-called" from the end of the first paragraph. Additionally, the first paragraph ends on righteous cry of indignation -- I approve, but this is an encyclopedia.

<dd>I think a good part of this article comes from the bad old times where we didn't pay attention to the stuff like references.

<p>I think we should be able to improve this to a GA status fairly easily - it's not even expantion which is the main problem, but lack of inline citations. If we can reference it well, and then expand it, we can make it even a FA - although that will take us some time.

<p>I don't know the part about Mykhailo Khmelnytsky - 'converted Jew' is a bit outlandish. I am planning to write a short article about him later. He ideed was subjected to 'infamia' - and was probably stripped of his noble status, but Jewish theory is very unusual. Besides, with all my respect, Polish sources should be treated with caution, they are not often without bias in regards to Khmelnytsky. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 18:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this is the stuff translated from Polish wiki we can take apart. I am pretty sure the 'converted Jew' is false, but it is an interesting trivia sourced to a particular historian, who has a short article on Polish wiki (<a href="../../../../pl/t/o/m/Tomasz_Padurra_6bc0.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Tomasz_Padurra">pl:Tomasz Padurra</a>). But if you are going to write an article about his father, I think such trivia will be better off moved to that article. And I completly agree we must treat Polish sources with caution (this is why it is best to illustrate their bias in the historiography section), although Ukrainian or Russian sources will have their own bias too. Btw, I am having trouble getting the notes to work - hopefully with <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">WP:FOOT</a> I'll be able to fix them, if not, they can be converted to normal cite.php ones.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 19:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>The lead sentence "He led the uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648 – 1654), which resulted in the Treaty of Pereyaslavl of 1654 with Tsardom of Russia." is awkward, biased and factually not true.

<li>17. "accept a loser's treaty" -&#160;??- that is the part from the old article. It will be changed--<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 01:07, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>18. The last passage presents only the Polish side of the story. Can something be said about Khmelnytsky's commemoration in Russia and Ukraine? What about the order of Khmelnytsky? The famous bridge in Moscow? We have separate articles about these. I also recall a Soviet movie starring <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Bondarchuk_8f07.html" title="Sergei Bondarchuk">Sergei Bondarchuk</a>.- that is the part from the old article.

<li>19. You need to determine which tense you want to use throughout the article. It is annoyong when one sentence is rendered in the present tense, and the following one in the past. - thank you for the suggestion --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 01:07, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>20. Per Manual of Style, there is no need to wikilink names each time they are mentioned in the article. Once is enough. Otherwise, the article looks overlinked and slovenly. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 23:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC) - Thank you again.

<p>HM! some "anonymous" - inserted another paragraph, that is already partly present in article. Also, facts expressed there are very, let's say, tremendous, but no sources are given. I think, cause of long article history this paragraph should be disscussed first, and only then used (or declined). --Galkovsky 15:51, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much of the new material is of general history coverage rather than of the person, the subject of the article. It should be moved to <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmelnytsky_uprising.html" title="Khmelnytsky uprising">Khmelnytsky uprising</a> and other articles on history. Of course having it here is better than not having it at all. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
