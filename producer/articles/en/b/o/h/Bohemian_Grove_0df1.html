<p>The Bohemian Club's membership includes many artists, particularly musicians, as well as many high-ranking business leaders, government officials (including some US Presidents) and senior media executives. As a measure of the Club's exclusivity, it is reported the waiting list for membership is from 15 to 20 years, though a fast track, three-year membership process is possible. Two current members must sponsor a prospective member. An initiation fee of $25,000 as of 2006 is required in addition to yearly membership dues. Elected members are also allowed to prorate the initiation fee into equal annual payments until they reach the age of 45.</p>
<p>After 40 years of membership the men earn "Old Guard" status, giving them reserved seating at the Grove's daily talks, as well as other perquisites. Members may also invite guests to the Grove although those guests are subject to a rigorous screening procedure. Guests come from across America and overseas. Californian guests are generally limited to attendance at the "<b>Spring Jinks</b>", in June, preceding the main July encampment.</p>
<p>The Grove motto is "<i>Weaving Spiders Come Not Here</i>", which implies that outside concerns and business deals are to be left outside. However, there is demonstrable evidence of political and business deals having been developed at the Grove. The Grove is particularly famous for a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Project_aaa1.html" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> planning meeting that took place there in September of 1942, which subsequently led to the atomic bomb. Those attending, apart from <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Lawrence_d608.html" title="Ernest Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> and military officials, included the president of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> and representatives of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Oil_06fa.html" title="Standard Oil">Standard Oil</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a>. Grove members take particular pride in this event and often relate the story to new attendees.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p><b>Bohemian Grove</b> was established over time, shortly after the founding of the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Club_9726.html" title="Bohemian Club">Bohemian Club</a> in 1872. For several years, the members of the Club camped together at various locations, including the present <a href="../../../m/u/i/Muir_Woods_9703.html" title="Muir Woods">Muir Woods</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_P._Taylor_State_Park_2ed8.html" title="Samuel P. Taylor State Park">Samuel P. Taylor State Park</a>, and a separate redwood grove near Duncan Mills, down river from the current location. Regular July encampments similar to those held today began in 1899.</p>
<p>The first parcel of the grove was purchased from <b>Melvin Cyrus Meeker</b> who developed a successful logging operation in the area. Gradually over the next decades, members of the Club purchased land surrounding the original location to the perimeter of the basin in which it resides. This was done to secure the rights to the water, so that its water supply would not be affected by uphill operations.</p>
<p>Not long after the Club's establishment by newspaper journalists, it was commandeered by prominent San Francisco-based businessmen, who provided the financial resources necessary to acquire further acreage and facilities at the Grove. They still retained the "bohemians" however&#160;— the artists and musicians&#160;— who continued to entertain international members and guests.</p>
<p>The Grove itself consists of <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequoia.html" title="Sequoia">redwood trees</a> over 1,500 years old. It is a spectacular nature preserve, untouched by logging, and containing many elevated walkways. The longevity of the redwoods stands as emblematic of an untouched natural setting, far removed from modern day vulgarity. This traditional "purity" underpins the Cremation of Care ceremony (see below).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Club_9726.html" title="Bohemian Club">Bohemian Club</a> is a private club; only active members of the Club (known as "Bohos") and their guests may visit the Grove. These guests have been known to include politicians and notable figures from countries outside the US. Particularly during the midsummer encampment, the number of guests is strictly limited due to the small size of the facilities and membership in the Bohemian Club does <i>not</i> necessarily confer the right to attend the annual encampment. Nevertheless, up to 1,500 members and guests have been reported as attending some of the annual encampments.</p>
<p><a name="Facilities" id="Facilities"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Edit section: Facilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Facilities</span></h2>
<p>The primary activities taking place at the Grove are varied and expensive entertainment, such as an elaborate Grove Play (known as "<b>High Jinx</b>") and musical comedies ("<b>Low Jinx</b>")&#160;— where female roles are played by men in drag&#160;— produced by the members and associate members of the Club. Thus, the majority of common facilities are entertainment venues, interspersed among the giant redwoods.</p>
<p>There are also sleeping quarters, or "camps" scattered throughout the grove, of which it is reported there were a total of 104 as of 2005. These camps, which are frequently patrilineal, are the principal means through which high-level business and political contacts and friendships are formed. For senior corporate executives, the camps are said to be the pinnacle of socio-political networking in the US.</p>
<p>According to Joel van der Reijden (see External Links below for a full list of camps and substantive details on the past affiliations of the camps' members), the pre-eminent camps are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mandalay</b> (Big Business/Defense Contractors/Politics/US Presidents);</li>
<li><b>Hill Billies</b> (Big Business/Banking/Politics/Universities/Media);</li>
<li><b>Cave Man</b> (Think Tanks/Oil Companies/Banking/Defense Contractors/Universities/Media);</li>
<li><b>Stowaway</b> (Rockefeller Family Members/Oil Companies/Banking/Think Tanks);</li>
<li><b>Uplifters</b> (Corporate Executives/Big Business);</li>
<li><b>Owls Nest</b> (US Presidents/Military/Defense Contractors);</li>
<li><b>Hideaway</b> (Foundations/Military/Defense Contractors);</li>
<li><b>Isle of Aves</b> (Military/Defense Contractors);</li>
<li><b>Lost Angels</b> (Banking/Defense Contractors/Media);</li>
<li><b>Silverado squatters</b> (Big Business/Defense Contractors);</li>
<li><b>Sempervirens</b> (Californian-based Corporations);</li>
<li><b>Hillside</b> (Military&#160;— Joint Chiefs of Staff)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Grove Stage</i>&#160;— it is an amphitheatre with seating for 2,000 used primarily for the Grove Play production, on the last Friday of the midsummer encampment. The stage extends up the hill side, and is also home to the second largest outdoor pipe organ in the world.</li>
<li><i>Field Circle</i>&#160;— a bowl-shaped amphitheatre used for the mid-weekend, "Low Jinx" musical comedy, as well as for variety shows.</li>
<li><i>Campfire Circle</i>&#160;— has a campfire pit in the middle of the circle, surrounded by carved redwood log benches. Used for smaller shows in a more intimate setting.</li>
<li><i>Museum Stage</i>&#160;— a semi-outdoor venue with a covered stage. Lectures and small ensembles shows.</li>
<li><i>Dining Circle</i>&#160;— seating approximately 1500 diners simultaneously.</li>
<li><i>Club House</i>&#160;— built in 1903, it is the site of the Manhattan Project planning meeting held in 1942 (see above).</li>
<li><i>The Owl Shrine and the Lake</i>&#160;— an artificial lake in the middle of the grove, used for the noon-time concerts and also the venue of the Cremation of Care, that takes place on the first Saturday of the encampment. It is also the location of the daily (12.30pm) "<b>Lakeside Talks</b>." Professor G. William Domhoff (see below) states these significant informal talks (many on public policy issues) have been given over the years by entertainers, professors, astronauts, business leaders, cabinet officers, <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> directors, future presidents and former presidents; these have been the subject of ongoing controversy, as the transcripts of these talks are rarely released to the public (though have been known to be used for such mundane purposes as reading for the lecturer's graduate students).</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Edit section: Symbolism and rituals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Symbolism and rituals</span></h2>
<p>Since the founding of the club, the Bohemian Grove's symbol has been the <a href="../../../o/w/l/Owl.html" title="Owl">owl</a>, long held as a representative of <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisdom.html" title="Wisdom">wisdom</a>. A forty-foot concrete owl stands at the head of the lake in the Grove and, since 1929, has served as the site of the yearly "Cremation of Care" ceremony (see below). The club's motto, <i>Weaving Spiders Come Not Here</i>, is taken from the second scene of Act 2 from <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream_9a69.html" title="A Midsummer Night's Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></i>; it signifies that the Grove is limited to exchanges about mutual concerns and is characterized by the term "the Bohemian Spirit."</p>
<p>The Club's patron saint is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Nepomuk_8bc7.html" title="John of Nepomuk">John of Nepomuk</a>, who legend says suffered death at the hands of a Bohemian monarch rather than disclose the confessional secrets of the queen (this of course, is not historically accurate). In reality, John confirmed Archbishop John of Jenštejn's candidate for Abbot of Kladrau against the wishes of Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. John was thrown off the Charles Bridge at Prague on March 20, 1393. A large wood carving of St. John in cleric robes with his index finger over his lips stands at the shore of the lake in the Grove, symbolising the secrecy kept by the Grove's attendees throughout its long history.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Edit section: Cremation of Care">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cremation of Care</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Cremation of Care</i> was devised in 1893 by a member named Joseph D. Redding, a lawyer from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, which serves as the opening to the Grove encampment, a mock human sacrifice representing "dull care" is cremated to symbolize the liberation of the participants.</p>
<p>Today, the ritual consists of hooded members accepting the <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effigy.html" title="Effigy">effigy</a> representing "dull care" from a ferryman traveling across a creek. Music and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireworks.html" title="Fireworks">fireworks</a> accompany the ritual, for dramatic effect. The mock human sacrifice is placed on an altar and set on <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>. A loud blood curdling scream is played over the loud speakers as the "dull care" is set a light. The ritual represents the act of embracing the revelry of Bohemian Grove while setting aside the "dull cares" of the outside world.</p>
<p>The ceremony takes place next to a 45-foot (15 m) high <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a> owl statue. During the ceremony, audio plays through nearby speakers providing the illusion of a speaking statue. The voice of the former-newsman <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cronkite_3389.html" title="Walter Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a>, a member of the Bohemian Club, is used as the voice of The Owl during the ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony involves the poling of a small boat across a lake containing an effigy of Care. Contrary to rumor, Care is not a child. Although "dead", Care has a speaking part and a deep voice. As suggested by the title, Care is eventually burned under the Owl statue towards the end of ceremony. This cremation symbolizes that within the Bohemian Grove members leave the care of the outside world. Contrary to rumor, no parts of the script contain reference to prisoners of the Druids representing enemy tribes such as the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celts.html" title="Celts">Celts</a>.</p>
<p>G.W. Domhoff, a sociologist, was able to obtain an unusual amount of access to the Bohemian Club's records and membership and was able, accordingly, to complete extensive research about the organization and their activities. Accordingly, he was able to detail the Cremation of Care ceremony, along with the High and Low Jinx and other ceremonies and plays of the Club.</p>
<p>The ceremony is meant to represent the destruction or burning of worldly concern. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">Alex Jones</a> infiltrated the Bohemian Grove in 2000 and filmed the final portion of the ceremony for his film <i>Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove</i>. The grove and Jones' investigation were also covered by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Ronson_37cc.html" title="Jon Ronson">Jon Ronson</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>'s four-part documentary, <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Rulers_of_the_World_1dba.html" title="Secret Rulers of the World">Secret Rulers of the World</a></i>.</p>

<p>With the combination of secrecy, power, and an elite bias, the Bohemian Grove has been a target for protest for many years. Specifically, the Bohemian Grove Action Network organizes protests and has aided journalists who wish to penetrate the secrecy surrounding the encampment. Over the years, individuals have infiltrated the Grove then later published video and claimed accounts of the activities at Bohemian Grove.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>-based journalist and filmmaker <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">Alex Jones</a> and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, became the first people to successfully infiltrate the Grove and make it out with documented evidence. With hidden cameras, Jones and Hanson were able to film the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cremation_of_Care_ee3f.html" title="Cremation of Care">Cremation of Care</a> ritual. The footage was the centerpiece of Jones' documentary, <i>Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove</i>. Jones states that a large number of men were in attendance during an "ancient <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaanite</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer.html" title="Lucifer">Luciferian</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> mystery religion ceremony" involving a 45-foot statue of an <a href="../../../o/w/l/Owl.html" title="Owl">owl</a> which he named <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moloch.html" title="Moloch">Moloch</a>.</p>
<p>A fellow <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> journalist, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Ronson_37cc.html" title="Jon Ronson">Jon Ronson</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, documented his view of the ritual in his book, <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Them%7E_Adventures_With_Extremists_dded.html" title="Them: Adventures With Extremists">Them: Adventures With Extremists</a></i>. Ronson's interpretation of the ritual was more sanguine; he felt it was a startlingly immature and weird way for world leaders to behave on their summer vacation, but did not see evidence of covert <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanism.html" title="Satanism">Satanism</a>.</p>
<p>In the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, a Grove employee named "Kyle" clandestinely shot more revealing footage and sent it to Alex Jones, who made it the centerpiece of a sequel, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Order_of_Death_a7d6.html" title="The Order of Death">The Order of Death</a></i>, which was released in 2005. This new footage reveals the Owl statue is hollow with a stone exterior. The Grove's public address system is controlled from within the statue, which is also apparently used as a storage area. Various effigies of Care were also found here. "Kyle" was also able to obtain two brochures about the festivities and a membership list.</p>

<li>"The club, which holds two-week outings outside San Francisco at the Bohemian Grove, where members run about in the woods naked, includes many former Republican officials..."<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED61131F932A25755C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED61131F932A25755C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">The New York Times</a></li>
<li>"The Bohemian Grove, that I attend from time to time — the (inaudible) and the others come there — but it is the most faggy goddamn thing that you would ever imagine. The San Francisco crowd, it's just terrible. I can't even shake hands with anybody from San Francisco."&#160;— President <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Nixon_16b3.html" title="Richard M. Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a>, Bohemian Club member starting in 1953 (Domhoff, p 15);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"If I were to choose the speech that gave me the most pleasure and satisfaction in my political career, it would be my Lakeside Speech at the Bohemian Grove in July 1967. Because this speech traditionally was off the record it received no publicity at the time. But in many important ways it marked the first milestone on my road to the presidency."&#160;— President Richard Nixon again, in a more mellow mood, in his <i>Memoirs</i> (1978), cited by Domhoff below. (The rule that sitting presidents are not allowed to attend the Grove was sparked by a media clamour to cover a Lakeside Talk that Nixon wanted to give in 1971, but was forced by the directors of the Grove to withdraw.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The mood is reminiscent of high school. There's no end to the pee-pee and penis jokes, suggesting that these men, advanced in so many other ways, were emotionally arrested sometime during adolescence" &#160;— Philip Weiss, <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_Magazine_82bc.html" title="Spy Magazine">Spy Magazine</a> journalist, who infiltrated the Grove in 1989.</li>
