<ul>
<li>Intro:
<ul>
<li>"It was primarily composed on Freddie's Yamaha baby grand piano." Is not a good sentence, or a whole one for that matter. It doesn't fit in with the other content of the intro, it would be probably better suited in "Recording".</li>
<li>Capitilize "Vinyl" of "vinyl record" in the infobox.</li>
<li>" However, it was released as a single, and became a huge commercial success." should be merged into the "a capella" sentnece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recording:
<ul>
<li>Fixing the paragraphing! There's stray sentences random floating around.</li>

<li>Why is the equipment listed? No lists!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Structure and analysis:
<ul>
<li>Change the title, it doesn't convey that you're talking about the song</li>
<li>This section is actually good, but try to add more information, perhaps a picture of them singing in the a capella?</li>
<li>Explain the importance/difference of 7ths/keys/chords to non musicians</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Video
<ul>
<li>Change the title, it's not informative</li>
<li>"it cost only £4500 to produce" compare to today's costs, compare between the two.</li>
<li>Fix the "visual feedback" link</li>
<li>"being double-tracked out of sync" ... which means?</li>
<li>Prose both mini paragraphs into one
<ul>
<li>"often cited as "the first ever music promo video"." This should be referenced via inline citation, as well as lots of other things..</li>
<li>"Taken literally, this statement is unlikely to be.." Merged this into to the previous sentence.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trivia
<ul>
<li>Remove TV trivia, they're not very significant</li>
<li>I would personally move information about the song onstage to it's own section, mainly because of it's higher significance compared to the other trivia (moving the reference of concerts from the introduction to this paragraph would also be an idea.)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">writing credit</span></h2>
<p>It's fairly well documented in various interviews that the writing credits in Queen, for nearly all of their career (up until 'The Miracle' album), reflected merely who wrote the lyrics - apparently they were trying to allocate credits for "Liar", which was an old song from Freddie's previous band ('Wreckage'?), and contained guitar lines written both by Wreckage's guitarist, and new stuff by Brian May - Freddie reportedly declared "as far as I'm concerned, whoever wrote the words has written the song", and May said they stuck to this rule of thumb until 'The Miracle'... ...bearing this in mind, is it not more accurate to state that, although Freddie Mercury formally owns the copyright for authoring the song, that May wrote the music for several of the guitar based bits? (I'd just go ahead and change the article, but don't want to be reverted by Queen fans crying sacrilage&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 13:19, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you got that idea from, nor do I recognize the Freddie Mercury quote that you are alluding to. With regard to songs credited to May and Mercury, those two generally wrote both the lyrics and the melody of their songs. On the other hand, Deacon and Taylor often received musical help from Mercury in particular. In fact, Taylor actually admits that Mercury re-wrote large sections of certain songs for him, such as "A Kind of Magic" and "Radio Ga Ga". However, as with any band (or even when seesion musicians are involved with solo artists), one individual may contribute in some way to another person's song without rightly claiming a songwriting credit.</p>

<dd>There has been a lot of rather woolly thinking and propaganda over this "Bohemian Rhapsody was the first ever music video" thing over the years: clearly it was not the first accompanying promotional film for a single (since ever Queen recorded earlier promo films for their stuff, never mind dozens of other bands!) - what *WAS* a "first" about it was that it started off the practice of a record company providing a promotional video/film for their acts' single release, with the express purpose of it being used on "Top of the Pops" when the act were not available to perform themselves - prior to this, the BBC would play the record and have "dancers" like "Pan's People" perform to it on screen. This was a big sea change and should be noted in the article--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 09:25, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">See-through tape myth</span></h2>
<p>The story about the recording tape coatings being worn off is mythical. While it seems to make sense in the light the existence of poor quality consumer tape with oxide that flakes or wears off, in fact recording studios use high quality tape which incoporates lubricants in the oxide. Just like a vinyl record properly cared for can withstand virtually unlimited playback, studio quality audio tape made by companies like BASF, 3M, or TDK used on well designed professional tape transports will not wear out even under heavy use. Any company producing such tape would have gone out of business. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 18:09, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>er, oxide-shedding on certain tape stocks is a well-known phenomenon. Also remember that Queen were near penniless until 1976 - they were recording in down-time with less-than-perfect stuff.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 09:24, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost no bands have any money when they begin recording. The tape and studio time is normally fronted by the recording company, not the band, even if they are billed for it against the record revenues. But my arguments are general and I have no evidence that it applies to this particular situation. Though I continue to think the story is extremely unlikely, it would be un-Wikilike to insist on a change based on my reasons given. On the other hand it is also Wiki practice to provide sources for an article. The story should not be there without a solid reference. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 16:00, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>the story has been repeated in interviews by May and Taylor in virtually every book I have ever read about Queen! I've also heard them say it on radio broadcasts. It was basically because they did *so* many overdubbs, the same bit of tape was run over the heads hundreds of time to the point it started shedding oxide.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 15:46, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This webpage <a href="http://www.arbitermt.co.uk/nuendo/users/queen0801.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arbitermt.co.uk/nuendo/users/queen0801.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> describes the digitizing of the "Bohemian Rhapsody" multitrack master in preparation for a surround sound remix, and mentions the common worn tape story, but the master is unspliced and therefore does not confirm the legend. The story is not that the tape was shedding (flaking), but that it was so thin one could see through it. Such tape would not likely produce useable sound. The veracity of a story is not based on how many times it is repeated, but by a quote from someone who was present at the event. If you can find a quote from one of them that would be great. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 18:43, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">84?</span></h2>
<p>Something is wrong here. Early in the article, it says the vocals took 84 hours to complete. Later on <i>84-part vocal choirs</i> are referred to. I doubt this is coincidence - from the rest of the text it sounds like what is really meant is that 84 vocal <i>takes</i> were combined in certain parts? If so, this is not <i>84-part</i> harmony - it would just be an 84-voice choir, perhaps with as few as 3 or 4 different parts.</p>
<p>Some elaboration on the actual subject of the song would be great too, if anyone knows why, for example, Scaramouche is referred to, or what 'Bismillah' means. The link to the page <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basmala.html" title="Basmala">Basmala</a> is most unenlightening! What does "Galileo figaro magnifico" mean? What does "Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me" mean? Etc. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevage_75d6.html" title="User:Stevage">Stevage</a> 16:37, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aye. In terms of functional harmony, there's nothing more complicated than a 7th chord. There are sections where there are (say) 3 different "choir parts", each made up of 4 harmony lines, each recorded by triple-track each voice, with is sthg like 3 x 3 x 4 = 36 layers of voices. Maybe in a few brief portions, it overlaps to the extent of giving 84 voices ... then the next bar will be just one solo Freddie... crazy stuff&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 19:23, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, ans: Bismillah is Arabic for "In the name of Allah". a "Scaramouche" is someone who likes to show off in public. and we all know who galileo and figaro are?</p>

<p>To start you all of I suppose, the lyrics make some reference to "A Day In the Life" by the Beatles, Brian has often said that "The Beatles where our bible", and this is evident in the lyrics of Bo Rap. "Momma, Just killed a man. Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead" Shares similarities with "Got up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head", rythmically and in content. As this was the time when Freddie was coming to terms with his homosexuality, some believe this to be his "coming out" song. The killing of the man he mentions being a metaphor for killing the hetrosexual self. "So you think you could stone me a spit in my eyes, so you think you could love me and leave and leave to die" Is seen by some as a rant at Freddies first Gay partner, who left him quickly. There are many other references, metaphors, and the such in the song, but many think it means nothing at all, an attempt to sound epic, when meaning nothing at all.

<p>In popular culture this song is associated with Freddie Mercury's struggle with AIDS.

<p><a name="180_voices"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">180 voices</span></h2>
<p>First of all, the "canon" for the number of vocal overdubs in the operatic bit is 180, which I'm absolutely sure it's merely a myth. Let's see what have the queennies said:</p>
<p>- 24th December 1977, Queen For An Hour (interview to the four of them on BBC2). Freddie said that the number of voices was 150 or perhaps 200.</p>
<p>- 1976, Jim Ladd interview with John Deacon. John said voices had been overdubbed "over fifty times".</p>
<p>- 6th November 1999, Radio 2: Roger Taylor said it was 128 voices.</p>
<p>- Brian May has stated several times (haven't got one here at the moment) that it was 180, and that's the number entering to popular culture and the so-called "common belief".</p>
<p>Let's see the reasons why I think it's merely an exaggeration: according to what May said, the way they recorded each line was the three of them singing three times each line. It'd mean 3x3=9, nine voices per part.</p>
<p>The "fattest" harmony in Bohemian Rhapsody is the big "for me", covering a huge spectrum. The highest note (Bb4) is just one voice: Roger's (you can easily prove it separating DTS channels in the new releases). The second highest is just Freddie doing Ab4. The following is Roger doing F4 (Greatest Karaoke Hits version omits the two previously mentioned, leaving the F4 uncovered). The bottom voice (doing F1 in "for") is just Freddie, as you can prove by using DTS mixes too. So, four voices so far.</p>
<p>The rest of the notes involved would be D4 (which would be difficult for Brian to hit but all in all possible), Bb3, F3, D3, Bb2, F2, Bb2. Let's say they all did the three overdubs for that, which would mean that the number of voices would be 7x9=63.</p>
<p>Hence, the total of voices in that "for me" part would be a maximum of 67 (63+4) voices, almost 1/3 of the famous 180 claimed by many.</p>

<dd>Well that's nicely reasoned, but I'm afraid also completely wrong :) Because there are bits in the opera section where there's about 4 treble-tracked 4-part harmonies overlap with each other, producing a great level of bounced multitracking than the "for meeeeeee" bit.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 23:29, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All right. Let's check that one as well: "Bismilah" is parallel octaves (6 voices tops, because both parts are just Freddie). "He will not let you go" is a three-part harmony, therefore it'd be 27 voices, and "let me go" is thee-part plus one sustained Roger's falsetto: 28 voices. And one single track by Freddie saying "never never never". Therefore: 27+6+28+1=62 voices. Less than "for me", much less than 128, 180 or 200, and all in all they hardly overlap in all sense of the word.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abrupt modulation from Bb to A...</span></h2>
<p>My doubt here is about the first key. It's true that Bo Rhap starts in Bb and all of that, but imo it modulates to Eb for "mamma ooooh". Reasons:</p>
<p>- Eb turns into the centre of gravity - Fm appears and is an important part of the harmony. Fm is a diatonic function in Eb (ii, or relative of the subdominant), while it's an unusual chromatic chord in Bb (iv).</p>
<p>What Freddie did in that song section was to apply sequentially a similar progression (I&gt;vi&gt;ii&gt;V) in two different (alas related) keys, thus having Bb&gt;Gm&gt;Cm&gt;F during "mamma just killed a man..." and Eb&gt;Cm&gt;Fm&gt;Bb during "mamma oooooh...".</p>
<p>Therefore the abrupt modulation would be from Eb to A, not Bb to A.</p>

<dd>Hmm, well he kinda drags the whole thing down through a chromatic-ish falling-down-the-stairs type cadence anyways, lasting a bar or so, it doesn#t just "suddenly" modulate from Eb to A.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 22:04, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello - I think I wrote that bit, and was going from memory of the sheet music, which I don't have access to any more.

<p>The music goes from Fm to Db, which is a relative change, while the guitar solo is still in the same mode, and then the jump to A from Db is a major third — a Coltrane change.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How is this "POV"?</span></h2>
<p>Not really very important, but one of the (many) reasons for this article not being considered "good" is the contention that that last part of the sentence "A promo video allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than the BBC's generic dancers." is "POV" (ie not neutral). Eh? "generic" is not a pejorative term. This sentance is crucial to to making the point about the "video revolution" BoRhap inaugurated, totally changing the way popular music could be presented on television.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 15:13, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I'm the person that fails all the Queen articles (you must love me round here :P), so I can probably shed some light onto it. POV stands for Point Of View, which generally means something is biased for one side, which we should try and avoid in Wikipedia. I'll give you a basic "POV?" lesson below:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>POV relates to a part (or even worse, an entire article) of an article being biased towards one opinion. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but we shouldn't convey these into our work. Examples of POV are below:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"Miss Piggy was later re-designed because the old model was <b>really ugly</b>."
<ul>
<li>An opinion, which taints the article, and takes sides.</li>
<li>That's a pretty simple one really, a better version would be: "Miss Piggy's model was later re-designed periodically after The Muppet Movie, coinciding with the death of Jim Henson and his son, Fred Henson not continuing her voicing, giving the role to fellow "muppeteer", Frank Oz."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"<b>A little knowm fact</b> is that Frank Oz invented cheese."
<ul>
<li>An opinion, who thinks it is a little known fact?</li>
<li>Something you have to look out for, you can do it without even thinking. A better version would be: "Although Vanessa Feltz is heralded for inventing cheese, the success belongs to Frank Oz."</li>
<li>Other words/phrases which are overlooked but are in this vein include: "Probably", "here and there", "Sometimes" and "Occassionally" - <b>AVOID THESE WORDS</b>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now back to <b>generic</b>, and why it's POV. "Rather than the BBC's <b>generic</b> dancers" is commenting on the versatility/individuality of Pans People, which isn't the point of your reference to them. Good alternatives would be:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers."</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers, used to accompany very different songs, leading to their somewhat lack of distinctive character."</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's personal dancers, who could detract appeal because of their unpopularity with youth."</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers, who were often tagged with a lack of personality."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Or it may just be me and it isn't POV :P Hope I've helped <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">Highway</a> 22:08, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I was correct then in thinking that you regarded "generic" as a pejorative term. It's not. It's not criticising Pan's People, it's just further emphasising the point that songs they danced to would all have the same ("generic") visual image on the screen (ie women in leotards dancing to it), rather than your band's own visual identity. The point is that having a video meant that band's music could be broadcast with their *own* visuals, not those of a generic dance troupe.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To say</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers." - doesn't emphasize the lack of the artist's own visuals</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers, used to accompany very different songs, leading to their somewhat lack of distinctive character." - is too verbose and clumsy when you could just say "generic"</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's personal dancers, who could detract appeal because of their unpopularity with youth." - is barking up the wrong tree - Pan's people weren't unpopular</li>
<li>"rather than the BBC's own dancers, who were often tagged with a lack of personality." - again, wrongheaded - viewers loved these sexy ladies LOL - but band's wanted to promote *themselves*, not Pan's People's bosoms.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 23:27, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>Calling Freddie a "rock-pianist/vocalist" is a rather odd way to summarize him. (I don't believe he ever gave solo piano recital concerts ;-) Or only ever played piano as opposed to other keyboards. He also often composed and occasionally performed on guitar. He was carried out record production and arrangement. And is perhaps most famous for his stage performance skills...etc etc). Something such as "rock-musician" might be a more general statement.</li>
<li>just saying "...THE band Queen" doesn't explain that Freddie was a member of Queen. Perhaps "...his band Queen"?</li>
<li>Is the term "heavy metal" not anachronistic for 1975? Would it be used by the band themselves? I think they would say "heavy rock".</li>
<li>The word "touted" is a bit suggestive. "acclaimed as" or "nomiated" or "voted" instead ...?--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 09:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Could you clarify "all sources" please miketm. You see I can't locate any source from the BR page here which makes me wonder ... I see Roddy from southampton, England in a comment on one of the link pages says, "The success of the song was largely due to DJ and comedian Kenny Everett. Everett was a close friend of Freddy's and played the single 14 times in one day on the radio station that he worked for. Freddy also appeared in several of his tv sketches. Everett too, was a homosexual and also died of AIDS years before Freddy." Which fits totally with waht I know (as in I listened to him doing this on the radio). In addition, I will look at my Queen documentaries because I am certain there are some interviews in there which shed more light on this.</dd>

Instead of it being Number One, it'll be Number Half!' It was the oddest thing I'd ever heard! So we all went out for an Indian and Ev asked for a copy.

<p>This song contains the title of the single that replaced it at no 1 in the UK charts in the lyrics (Mamma Mia). Is it the only song to do this?

Perhaps, like Don MacLean, Mercury has never said - and is unlikely to do so now.

<p>-The song does not draw anything from Live and Let Die, though that is a great song. If anything, Live and Let Die draws from earlier, similar Queen works such as Liar and My Fairy King, which bore similar styles. March of the Black Queen from Queen II is often referred to in the fan community as the prototype for Bohemian Rhapsody. There was no inspiration for BoRhap from LALD--LALD switches between the same two musical themes (slow, piano rock and hard rock), whereas BoRhap goes all over the map (like Liar, MFK, and MOTBQ). The LALD reference is incorrect.</p>
<p>-"It may also owe something to the example of Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die (1973) which does something similar." The two songs themselves are NOT a valid reference for this statement. Find a real reference that says this, then get back to us.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sourced or not, it's a bad comparison. "Live and Let Die" is FAR more conventional than "Bohemian Rhapsody." Its structure is little more than a variant on the standard verse-chorus-bridge structure of most rock songs. (Having the bridge occur after the first verse-chorus is uncommon but not unheard of.) Some elements of the song are a little creative, but it doesn't stretch the boundaries of pop music in any way remotely comparable to BR. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarbehraglaim_d3ba.html" title="User:Marbehraglaim">marbeh raglaim</a> 22:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
