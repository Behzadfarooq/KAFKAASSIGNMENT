<p>I'd like to get involved, but I don't have the time right now to edit it properly (or fight an ongoing war with a crank). Sorry. You might try asking all the people who have made comments on <a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanWMerks_4bce.html" title="User talk:JanWMerks">User_talk:JanWMerks</a>. You could also look through his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JanWMerks_9427.html" title="Special:Contributions/JanWMerks">article edits</a> to see what other articles he's been going at. Doubtless he has annoyed editors of other articles. You might try contacting them too. Best of luck. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunch_e74c.html" title="User:Lunch">Lunch</a> 19:49, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Isn't it about time to contact a prominent geostatistical scholar engaged as an Associate Editor with the <i>Journal for Mathematial Geology</i> such as Armstrong, Journel, or Krige, and complete the text for <i>Geostatistics</i>? What else do they have to lose? They lost the variance of the distance-weighted average already! JWM. --Iconoclast 15:51, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Howdy Bohunk &amp; Lunch, You need not make time to edit geostatistics because the junk science of assuming spatial dependence and interpolation without justification is beyond salvation. The war is over, IAMG's brass and JMG's brains are wrong, and the crank is right. My questions are simple and the geostatocracy is silent. What happened to the variance of the single distance-weighted average? Where have all the degrees of freedom gone? Why assume rather than verify <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spatial_dependence.html" title="Spatial dependence">spatial dependence</a>? Why not talk to Journel and find out what's wrong with "classical <i>Fischerian</i> (sic!) statistics"? JWM. --Iconoclast 23:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will read up on your arguments/references when I have time, but these will not be presented in the form to which you gravitate. Note the fact that most people do not argue directly with your statements, their POV (of which you ought to be familiar) is primarily adverse to the antagonistic context of your entries, surely you recognize their unencyclopedic nature. In any case, you must also recognize that I have not spent my time recklessly deleting your entries, I have simply attempted to approach the issue from an objective perspective, and believe that most of my edits reflect this. Most people who read this article probably dont have your level of understanding of the topic, but anyone can recognize your distaste; perhaps you should collaborate elsewhere, as those of us who desire to create an intelligent article do not need the assistance of someone who believes that the topic lacks all intelligence.</p>
<p>As of now, there are a few more people who have contributed to the article, these things take time though. I have been approaching people with math backgrounds as well as professors, however they are not able to commit always, and this topic is not the most interesting. I do believe that geostatistics presents some problems, however I feel that it is a viable and accurate method, used for the analysis of many environmental, economic, urban, and logistical problems. <a href="../../../b/o/h/User%7EBohunk_235d.html" title="User:Bohunk">SCmurky</a> 01:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once upon a time I asked a famous professor emeritus of mathematicics how he would feel about a variant of mathematical statistics where degrees of freedom are no longer relevant. His response was, <i>"But without degrees of freedom statistical inferences are impossible."</i> Please peruse what Stanford's Journel wrote to JMG's Editor, when he wrote, and what the latter wrote to me. I've a profound distaste for scholars such as Armstrong, Clark, Journel, Krige, and scores of others who cannot concede that each distance-weighted average has its own variance.

<p>I've been attempting to overview and tidy up the geography cats which involve the places where people live. From the top level down to local neighbourhoods. There has been some overlapping and various mis-routings. It's been interesting looking at it all. However, there appear to be two useful ways of doing it - by region, and by size. And these can operate side by side quite usefully. The by region isn't a problem. But the by size has become difficult because <a href="../../../h/m/a/User%7EHmains_e270.html" title="User:Hmains">User:Hmains</a> wishes to use the term settlements to cover all sizes of communities, and has altered dictionary definitions <a href="http://www.answers.com/settlement&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/settlement&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to fit his own understanding of the term - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Settlement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110496009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Settlement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110496009" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Community appears to be the term used most often to describe the places where people live, regardless of size. This is the definition of community - <a href="http://www.answers.com/community&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/community&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I did some sorting, placing the cat Human communities under Human geography. Human communities splitting into Urban geography and Rural geography. And those splitting into appropriate sized communities - cities, districts, neighbourhoods, villages, settlements, etc. Hmains has reverted much of my work, and insists on settlements being the term we should use - basing it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_18#Category:Settlements_by_region|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_18#Category:Settlements_by_region|" rel="nofollow">this decision</a>, which was a declined proposal to rename Settlements by region to Populated places by region. What do you think? Is settlement an acceptable term for covering human communities ranging from well established cities down to refuge camps. Is Human community a viable alternative? Are there other choices (apart from populated places of course!)? I have started a discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Geography#Advice_requested" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Geography#Advice_requested" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Categories#Advice_requested" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Categories#Advice_requested" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with the above wording, but no response as yet.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I've originally visited the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriging.html" title="Kriging">kriging</a> page several months ago, looking for useful information (Specifically, I wanted to implement kriging in a Fortran program to interpolate unordered elevation data). The page struck me as being chaotic and going off at a tangent; little specific information on the kriging technique was provided, but there was a lot of vituperative wrangling against geostatistics.</p>
<p>I complained on the talk page and waited a long time for the article to improve. I revisited the article periodically, read the talk page and related user talk pages closely (<a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanWMerks_4bce.html" title="User talk:JanWMerks">JanWMerks</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerksmatrix_1613.html" title="User talk:Merksmatrix">Merksmatrix</a> in particular), and came to the conclusion that the reason the article is so wretched is because it is under continuous attack by a father-and-son team of cranks, who disrupt any constructive work with their own unsubstantiated agenda.</p>
<p>In order to give bona-fide editors like you more breathing space, I recommend that this matter be given due process under <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a>. Specifically, I propose that a request for help be filed under <a href="../../../a/m/a/Category%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1107.html" title="Category:AMA Requests for Assistance">AMA Requests for Assistance</a>, as a first step. Perhaps the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Advocate</a> will be able to guide us in the steps that need to be taken to stop the disruptive behavior.

<dd>I've been pretty active with the geostats article, not so much lately however. The geostats article is constantly being revised by these guys, but the issues they raise are repeated over and over. Kriging is an aspect of geostats which is simply a type of interpolation, the only difference from the distance-weighted algorithm is in the presence of statistical measures for standard deviation (standard distance), variance, and potential error; variance is presented as semi-variance due to the geographical aspects of spatial information. My view is that this argument is dead, no further attention needs to be paid to the issues that JanWMerks raises, as this logic may be applied to all statistics, in that they may be abused. We do not need dispute resolution, I've already spent loads of time attempting to find consensus... Instead, I propose you do what I've done with the geostats article, and add so much relevant material, that the controversy section provided by Jan is relegated to an insignificant portion of the end of the article. I still need to do lots of work on the geostats article though... <a href="../../../b/o/h/User%7EBohunk_235d.html" title="User:Bohunk">SCmurky</a> 02:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>“I've already spent loads of time attempting to find consensus...” That's my point exactly: you're wasting time in futile discussion and reverting, rather than doing constructive edits. In view of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJanWMerks&amp;diff=48724314&amp;oldid=48691582" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJanWMerks&amp;diff=48724314&amp;oldid=48691582" rel="nofollow">this statement</a> (and many others in similar vein), further discussion is IMHO pointless. That's why I'm pushing towards <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_probation_d6c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Article probation">Article probation</a>, so that constructive work may be done instead. But in order to obtain article probation for the Merkses, due process must be followed, as I suggested above.</dd>
<dd>“I propose you do what I've done with the geostats article, and add so much relevant material...” I cannot, for the simple reason that I know very little about kriging. As a matter of fact, I was hoping to learn the basics of kriging from this very article, which is why this sordid stalemate infuriates me so much. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 08:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
