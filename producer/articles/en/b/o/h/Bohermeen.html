<p>For nearly fourteen hundred years the local area went by the name of <i><a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardbraccan.html" title="Ardbraccan">Árd Braccan</a></i> or <i>Ardbraccan</i>, meaning <i>the height of Braccan</i>, the hill on which St. Braccan located his mediæval monastery and which in the 9th century became a diocese with its own bishop. Even when the diocese of Ardbraccan joined with other small dioceses such as <i>Fore</i> and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kells.html" title="Kells">Kells</a> to form the Diocese of Meath, Braccan's hill became the location of the palace of the Bishop of Meath.</p>

Anglican bishops continued to live in the area until 1958. When in the nineteenth century the Roman Catholic Church re-established a local parish in the area, it was decided to use a different name to the local Church of Ireland parish of Ardbraccan. 'Bohermeen' became the chosen name.

<p>The area known as Bohermeen has had a predominantly <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> according to every census done. It did however have a sizeable <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Ireland_72de.html" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> population (see below), though that dwindled significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries. The population was hit to a minor extent by the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Potato_Famine_%281845-1849%29_9a0b.html" title="Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)">Second Great Famine</a> in the mid-19th century. Local folklorists record the disappearance of entire pre-famine settlements in, for example, the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townland.html" title="Townland">townland</a> of Greetiagh within the parish. Though the records of the period are scant, folklore recorded anonymous deaths of parishioners in some of the ancient mediæval graveyards, notably at Markiestown, where the last burials in the ancient (now destroyed) cemetery were believed to have occurred in the famine era.</p>
<p>The landholdings of the era were recorded as part of Griffith's Valuation, a major land survey carried out in Ireland between 1848 and 1864.</p>

<p>The major land reform of the late 19th century changed the landownership pattern. The breakup of the large estates of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentry.html" title="Gentry">gentry</a> saw most parishioners move from being tenant farmers to small landowners in their own right.</p>
<p>As late as the 1930s a project carried out by the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Folklore_Commission_939a.html" title="Irish Folklore Commission">Irish Folklore Commission</a>, in which school children were asked to write down their description of their areas, recorded that most houses in the area were <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatched_cottage.html" title="Thatched cottage">thatched cottages</a>.

<p>The Ardbraccan/Bohermeen area contained a thriving <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> community until the early twentieth century. However a series of unrelated economic, social and religious changes led to the large-scale disappearance of the Church of Ireland community.</p>
<p>These changes included the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869 which undermined the financial viability of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath's landed estate and led to the laying off of his mainly Protestant staff and the land reforms of the 1880s to the early 1900s, which saw the breakup of the large Protestant estates such as the Waller estate at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allenstown_House_1186.html" title="Allenstown House">Allenstown House</a>, and their sale to their Catholic tenantry, again costing many local Protestants their jobs running the estates.</p>

<p>The impact of the First World War, when many Irish Protestant families lost some or all of their sons at <a href="../../../y/p/r/Ypres.html" title="Ypres">Ypres</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somme.html" title="Somme">Somme</a> left large numbers of families without heirs and Protestant daughters without Protestant potential husbands, had a devastating impact, an impact augmented separately by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_X_cc92.html" title="Pope Pius X">Pope Pius X</a>'s <i><a href="../../../n/e/_/Ne_Temere_d04e.html" title="Ne Temere">Ne Temere</a></i> decree, which demanded that all children of Catholic-Protestant marriages be brought up as Catholic (previously, the tradition had been that the boys would be brought up in the religion of their father, the girls in the religion of their mothers). This resulted in a situation where a marriage of a Protestant to a Catholic meant the end of the Protestant line in the family.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a> during the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_War_3972.html" title="Anglo-Irish War">Irish War of Independence</a> lead many Protestants, who had identified with the <i>ancien regime</i> of British rule in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_Castle_56ed.html" title="Dublin Castle">Dublin Castle</a> to move to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. A combination of changing economic structures, changing class structures, changing religious structures, changing political structures, changing marriage patterns and the First World War produced a terminal decline in the numbers of Protestants in the area. Whereas once the Protestant community counted among its number one bishop, two churches, all the landed gentry, many of their staff and a local rector, as well as a local Protestant primary school, all have gone, with the ancient St. Ultan's Church of Ireland in Ardbraccan ceasing to be used for Divine Service in 1981. One of the last members of the Church of Ireland in the locality, the former owner of <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durhamstown_Castle_162f.html" title="Durhamstown Castle">Durhamstown Castle</a>, Samuel McClelland, died in 2003.</p>

<p>As a result, a community of mixed religious heritage and identification had become almost wholly Roman Catholic. However the Roman Catholic community today has shown a notable concern to preserve the area's Protestant heritage. When in the mid 1980s the former owner of Ardbraccan House, Colonel Foster, decided to spend much of the money he had received from the sale of the house and lands on replacing the dangerously decayed roof on the thousand year old church spire at the deconsecrated Anglican Church, local Catholic timber merchants supplied timber for the work free of charge, along with staff to do the reroofing. When Colonel and Mrs Foster, who had moved into the old schoolhouse at the entrance to the Anglican Church grounds, decided to take on the task of restoring the derelict cemetery, in which both Anglican and Catholic people from the area were buried, the local Catholic parish joined the efforts, offering resources and manpower. The communities sought and received state assistance so that the historic burial ground could be fully restored and preserved.</p>
<p>The Parish of Bohermeen today consists of three Catholic Churches and over one thousand Roman Catholics, with a handful of members of other religious faiths. Just as its nearest town, Navan, has become a <i>dormitory town</i> to <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> 30 miles away, so it has become a collection of dormitory townlands to Navan, which itself is expected within a generation to reach city size. Whereas most of its employment was once farm-based, over 40% now would in urban centres, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trim%2C_County_Meath_f260.html" title="Trim, County Meath">Trim</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kells.html" title="Kells">Kells</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navan.html" title="Navan">Navan</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, commuting long distances.</p>

<p>A controversial new <a href="../../../n/3/_/N3_road.html" title="N3 road">N3</a> motorway linking the towns of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavan.html" title="Cavan">Cavan</a> and Kells with Dublin is scheduled to cut through farmland within sight of Ardbraccan House and the ancient monastery site in Ardbraccan, before slicing through the archaeologically sensitive site of Tara, the capital of Ireland under the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_King_of_Ireland_05c4.html" title="High King of Ireland">Árd Rí</a> (High King of Ireland) in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medi%C3%A6val.html" title="Mediæval">mediæval</a> times.</p>
<p>Though the proposed route of the motorway at Tara has been the subject of an international outcry from academics, historians, environmentalists and others, the Irish government under <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertie_Ahern_225c.html" title="Bertie Ahern">Bertie Ahern</a> has publicly supported the plans, and condemned those who criticise them. A legal challenge is being planned to try to force the National Roads Authority to select an alternative route.</p>
