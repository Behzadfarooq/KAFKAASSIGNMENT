<p>I'm taking out the references to the Owl being named Moloch, because there is no support factually or mythologically for this to be true. Moloch was represented as a bull, not an owl, and all the references to the Grove Owl being called Moloch that I can find trace back to Alex Jones, a man who has repeatedly made unfounded accusations regarding the Grove.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't take this out. Perhaps you've never noticed the owl beside the "1" on the one dollar bill. Whatever the owl's name, be it "Moloch" or something else, is rather irrelevant. The name is more the issue here. Alex Jones might have misheard the name or something. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.171.24.99_fd04.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.171.24.99">67.171.24.99</a> (talk) 06:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>It is hardly the "main attraction" at the grove. It is the defacto "opening ceremony", but most of the political big wigs are there only on the second weekend, anyway.</p>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld is a member of Hillbillies, but hasn't attended the grove in years, either.</p>
<p>The club now prohibits members and guests to bring in the secret service as they have been disruptive to the grove activities. Nixon has visited the grove (as a member of the Cave Man camp) without the secret service, but G.H.W.Bush has not visited the grove since he became president. Probably a smart thing to do.</p>

<dd>What are you questioning? That these named individuals have attended at all or whether they attended that particular ceremony? If the latter, reword it so that, to your satisfaction, it no longer implies that any specific named individual attended any specific ceremony. It's hard to believe that you've even started to read the external links if you're questioning the effigy burning. Have you read them? If you haven't, I suggest that you start with Forbes magazine, then move on to the dissertation at the end of the list, though you'll probably find it rather dry and unsensational reading. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">Jamesday</a> 00:40, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Daniel, I'm about to restore a couple of cites you removed. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Francisco Examiner, your edit comment said that it was a different club. It's the same club. The Bohemian Grove is the summer campground of the San Francisco Bohemian Club. The end of the article explains the early campground days and the subsequent acquisition of the land which is now called the Bohemian Grove. See "Children who had been members of the Bohemian Club fondly remembered annual encampments and summer hi-jinks at the Bohemian Grove" and following text, starting about half way through the story.</li>
<li>Rumsfeld. He's a well known participant (as if you want cites, or try a quick Google search - I think you'll find him mentioned in the dissertation as well) and the July journey to the club is clearly what he's referring to, though I've reworded it to say exactly what he says and let the reader draw their own conclusions about what he was referring to. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">Jamesday</a> 10:37, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rumsfeld a "well known participant?" Though he is "well known" but not a "well known participant." User:Boho</p>
<hr />
<p>I removed "Many attendees are politically conservative." Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, and numerous other politicians who would never tout themselves as "politically conservative" have attended Bohemian Grove meetings. The allegation was unsupported and factually incorrect. <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.28.2.172.html" title="User:65.28.2.172">65.28.2.172</a> 19:22, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From reading William Poundstone's Big Secrets series, I can believe that there's a camp called "Hillbillies". I'm also willing to believe that one or both Bush presidents have attended. I'm baffled, though, by the following paragraph, which appeared at an odd place in the article (after the external links):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Bush's cabin at the Grove is called the Hillbillies. The Bush family worships Moloch and are <i>reptocrats</i> according to David Icke . In other words (as Dubya is wont to say), they are shapeshifting lizards. Other members of the Hillbillies camp includes Walter Cronkite and Micky Hart.

<p>Preface: The past few days I read through most of the Rotten.com Library and noticed that many of the articles are either new or radically filled out. I also noted that several Wikipages linked to the Library and took it upon myself to add links to all relevant pages with significant Rotten pages (none of the spartan mini-pages). Several Users complained on my edit pages, and User:Clawson eventually reverted most of the pages. The following are the conversations made on various talk pages that I've organized here by users involved in the conversation (It seems to make the most sense).--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 06:58, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As soon as my edits started to be removed (or I became aware of that fact) I stopped adding to it because I'm not a big fan of gigantic retarded edit wars. Actually, in order to make sure this can be a conversation about the quality of the links instead of a fight, I make this gesture: You've missed some, further down the line. I believe Joanie Laurer is the last one not removed, but almost all of my edits after the first Bohemian Grove edit are on this topic. Also, please make sure you don't remove other edits I added while adding these links (not a shot at you, but it happened once in an edit war and it made my head explode).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In reference to your comments about them being poorly written editorials, you removed about 30 of the articles in the course of about 25 minutes, which make your claim that you read each one before deleting it a little bit questionable. Another point I'd like to make is that POV is not a qualifier for removal. In fact Rule 4. on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> says "On articles with multiple Points of View, a link to sites dedicated to each, with a detailed explanation of each link. The number of links dedicated to one POV should not overwhelm the number dedicated to any other. One should attempt to add comments to these links informing the reader of what their POV is."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many of these articles have the POV of the Rotten Library articles included in the page, but not in the link section. In fact, much of the material that is taken from the Rotten pages and finds it's way into the Wikipage isn't cited anywhere as the source of the information, and I know that I have at least used the page as a source, and there were also a couple pages that included the link already to reference the fact that information had been taken the page.</dd>

I agree with TheGrza that this isn't vandalism, and must commend him for the constructive way he's trying to solve this. However, mass adding external links is always going to attract a lot of opposition, and rightly so. External links to informative articles should only be used in the rare case where important facts are missing from the article in question, and even then only as a stop-gap measure until the information has been incorporated into the article in question. In the majority of the rotten links posted I've only seen highly-pov essays on the subject matter that didn't significantly add anything to our articles. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 15:20, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)</p>

Bush was a Skull and Bones member, and that society is famous for their tenet of gathering power in any way possible, including pretense of strong religious devotion. There is plenty of reason to question his faith, however, given his apparent level of intelligence, it may be quite possible that he has learned to believe the lie, if it is/was such. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.171.24.99_fd04.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.171.24.99">67.171.24.99</a> (talk) 06:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Actually, it's not the "various claims" of Alex Jones to which this article refers, but in fact the Video Evidence which clearly depicts the cremation of care, and if there is dispute over the use of the term "occult" or "occultic" I shall refer to the Oxford English Dictionary. After reading its definition, then tell me this is not occult:</p>
<pre>
1. a. Not disclosed or divulged, secret; kept secret; communicated only to the initiated. Now rare.
   b. Of or relating to magic, alchemy, astrology, theosophy, or other practical arts held to involve agencies of a secret or mysterious nature; of the nature of such an art; dealing with or versed in such matters; magical.
2. a. Not apprehended, or not apprehensible, by the mind; beyond ordinary understanding or knowledge; abstruse, mysterious; inexplicable.
3. a. Hidden from sight; concealed (by something interposed); not exposed to view.
</pre>

   2. With the. The realm of the unknown; the supernatural world or its influences, manifestations, etc.; (collectively) magic, alchemy, astrology, and other practical arts of a secret or mysterious nature.

<p>So is the Grove Occult or not?</p>
<p>No, its just a fraternity. As "occultic" as, say, the Church of Bob. ...Satellite link attached to article. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricEye_f10d.html" title="User:ElectricEye">ElectricEye</a> 05:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One such line reads "the primary means of corporate contact," anything to back that?</p>

"The world is divided in to three classes of people: a very small group that makes things happen, a somewhat larger group that watches things happen, and the great multitude which never knows what happened."</p>

<p>One editor believes that this article may have WP:BLP violations because it is reporting a factual event regarding the Bohemian Grove. So far he has refused to dialog about this, but I am trying to do so.</p>
<p>I disagree that WP:BLP is violated for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, this is not a Biography of living persons.</li>
<li>Even if it were a biography, I believe that the requirements are : Verifiability, Reliable Sources and Neutral Point of View. If these are met, then the problems of violating WP:BLP are avoided. In this article, the item is referenced and there are other articles on the project which give further details. Furthermore, the article describes the suit as having been defeated. Thus, this passage meets the criteria of Verifiability, Reliable Sources and Neutral Point of View. It simply reports a factual bit of history.</li>
<li>There are no implications, assertions or innuendo regarding living persons. That living persons also happen to appear (in a different section) is not the same thing as a slur, innuendo or implication of something described elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other objections to this passage but it should NOT be an objection based upon WP:BLP. Since we have such policies they should be taken seriously and not used to indiscriminately remove information from articles that we do not like. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 19:32, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
