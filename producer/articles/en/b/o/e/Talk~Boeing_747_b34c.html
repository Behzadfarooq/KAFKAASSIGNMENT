<p>EricD, I am just wondering why you removed that mass of interesting facts about the 747. I didn't put that stuff onto the page but it's a pity to lose it. Was it not in the public domain?<br />
Just for your interest I took the pic of the JAL 747 at Heathrow. I hope you like it. I always provide a link to a larger pic (800 pixels wide). There is another of my pics at the top of the Paris page.<br />
Best Wishes, <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Arpingstone</a> 23:19 Jan 26, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nice photo. I believe these facts come from Boeing and yes it might be a copyright infrigement. What do you think about sending a mail to Boeing&#160;? I think they will accept. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a></p>
<p>Or just re-write them. This has several advantages: (a) no copyright problem, (b) can be more concise, and (c) provides the opportunity to use some editorial discretion - for example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>During test flights, a Boeing 747 almost reached the speed of sound while in a dive.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>can be left out - this is true of just about <i>any</i> high-subsonic aircraft. It's routine to test this stuff.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The 747-400 can carry more than 57,000 gallons of fuel (215,745 L), making it possible to fly extremely long routes, such as San Francisco to Sydney, Australia.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>can become:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 747-400 carries over 215,000 litres of fuel, making it possible to fly long routes, such as San Francisco to Sydney.</dd>

<p>(Gallons is a very bad measure to use in an aviation article - not only is it an obsolete measure outside the USA, but there is the perennial confusion between Imperial and US gallons, and aircrew tend not to use volumetric measures of fuel anyway - in the US it's normally <i>pounds</i> of fuel that matters. Secondly, SF to Sydney is no longer a "very" long route. It's aircraft like the A340 and the 777 that fly <i>very</i> long range routes.)</p>
<p>I would recommend that <b>pounds</b> of fuel, be specified, instead of liters, gallons, etc. That is how fuel is always boarded on the manifest----by pounds, because on the long flights the tanks often cannot be filled to capacity because of the Max Takeoff weight limitation. Fuel density varies, which is why the 747-400 has a fuel density measurement in its fuel software. There can be considerable differences in how many liters/gallons of fuel the tanks can hold, because of density variations of the fuel being loaded. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 22:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are several uses of statute miles too: air and marine distances should always be in nautical miles or kilometres. Statute miles are only for cars. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 00:14 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>The only problem with using nautical miles, is that most people (people that are not diehard aviation fans, or pilots) can not relate to what these terms (nautical miles, pounds of fuel, etc.) mean. Also, a specification can not be copyrighted. It is like saying that a certain car can go 0 to 60 in so many seconds. Is everybody who republishes this information violating the law?</p>

<p>I don't agree with the <i>class of airliners known as jumbo jets</i> bit. A jumbo is a 747, end of story. I don't know what the A380 will do to the terminology, but today, referring to a plane other than a 747 as a jumbo is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkonen_d485.html" title="User:Markonen">Markonen</a> 17:15, 20 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree. This is a glaring error. I am going to change it.
<ul>
<li>Disagree. Even though the term is less generic that it was, I predict that the Airbus A380 will become a jumbo jet as well once it is released, at least in informal conversation. A Google search for "jumbo jet airbus a380" gives 19 000 hits. I don't think 'jumbo jet' should redirect to Boeing 747; I think that it should talk about large aircraft in general or at least be a disambiguation page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the early days of wide-body jets, Jumbo-Jet was a more general term than it has become. Once the 747 was rolled out, it became THE Jumbo-Jet, and the term tended not to get used for other planes. But the fact remains that the term was general before that. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 02:01, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I found out a bit more about this. The media was using the term jumbo jet in the 60s for all wide-body types. When the 747 was rolled out, Boeing went out of their way to try and prevent the media applying the term to the 747. I'm not sure why they were so keen to avoid the term, but the press packs at the time were at pains to avoid the term, and the press instructed not to use it. Of course in time this effort was a waste of time. I've added a para to the trivia section to mention this. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 00:13, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Adrian, I think linking to the other pics is a good idea - in fact I almost did that myself, but got called away and didn't have time. The small differences that you mention are very small however, I don't think they are noticeable except once they're pointed out, or unless you're a 747 anorak, but other may disagree! I think had the images shown different aspects of the aircraft, rather than all showing more or less similar views, it would have been harder to make the case. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 21:34, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This appears to have been removed but incase someone tried to add, it is inaccurate. For starters, the Boeing-Airbus situation is much more complex. Boeing in fact is heavily subsidised in one way or another for example by US miltary contracts. They are also helped by US politics, for example with the Japan deal and with the large number of Chinese orders which appear to have been mostly do appease the US government rather then because of technical or price merit (these may have been true but we don't know because the Chinese didn't consider them greatly). Also, calling these loans risk free is just plain dumb. Although they're not normal loans, you can be sure as hell if Airbus blows a lot of money for nothing, the people and the European governments are NOT going to be happy. Furthermore, Boeing had no choice but to "bet the farm" these many many years ago since they likely would have died otherwise. They did it and were lucky. However Boeing might not have even gotten to the 747 without the 707 and if you'll read the 707 and other related articles, you'll realise the 707 developed was basically subsidied by the US as it was largely based on a project virtually guaranteed to be a miltary succeed. The truth of the matter is neither Boeing or Airbus would be where they are were not for government support which continues to this day... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 21:39, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but you are wrong about that. The cabin altitude climbs as the plane climbs. If the plane is flying below 25,000 ft., the cabin altitude will be near sea level. But, if it is flying at 39,000 ft., the cabin altitude will be closer to 8,000 ft. As for temperature, that varies a lot too. It can be a lot hotter in the rear of the cabin, where passengers are jammed together (more people per sq. ft.), than in first class, where they are spread out. That is why the most modern airliners have zone controls that allow the flight attendants to adjust temperature for their particular zones, by as much as 10 degrees, either side of the master control in the cockpit, for that zone. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 21:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>You are using incorrect nomenclature. The density of the air in a pressurized cabin is a function of the actual altitude of that cabin. Thus, the air in that cabin weighs less when the cabin is pressurized to an altitude of 8,000 ft., than when it is pressurized to sea level. "Far more steady" is a meaningless statement, in this discussion. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 22:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed this statement, because it is filled with inaccuracies:</p>
<p>"Because of its length, there is a small flexure of the fuselage in flight. This effect was not anticipated in the design of the autopilot on early models, and so there is a very slow oscillation in yaw when flying on autopilot. This was first discovered on an overseas flight to the Paris Airshow, when some of the people in the rear became air sick. Upon return, the plane went through tests to solve the problem and adjust the yaw damper system. The effect is now too small to be noticeable by passengers."</p>
<hr />
<p>The "dutch roll" problem of jet airliners (which causes irritating side-to-side yawing) is caused by the degree of sweepback of the wings, not by the flexing of the fuselage.</p>
<hr />
<p>The yaw problem is addressed with a <b>yaw damper</b>, which all modern jetliners have. That is not a part of the autopilot system. The autopilots do not command any inputs to the rudder (the only way to counter-act the yaw, is by commands to the rudder), during most modes of flight. The only time the autopilots give commands to the rudder, is during a Category III coupled autoland approach and landing.</p>
<hr />
<p>The irritating yaw problem was well known long before the 747 was designed. It was pretty uncomfortable in the rear section of the Boeing 720 (the <b>short</b> version of the 707), even though it had a full-time yaw damper. The yaw dampers on the newest jetliners do a much better job of counteracting that irritating yaw, than the ones designed in the 60s. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 21:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC) <a name=".3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D"></a></p>

<p>All airliners are certified to keep on flying after the loss of one engine, at the most critical time (during takeoff, right after V1 speed). As to any flight continuing to destination, that is a decision function of the captain and dispatch, in light of the applicable FARs, weather, etc. It is not a function of the design of the aircraft, that differs from any other type of aircraft. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 22:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with this. For one, the 747A program has **not** been officially launched yet. Secondly, the 747A is signifigant enough to warrant its own article for the time being, for the sole reason that it is dealing with a specific program that is relevant to ongoing events, while the 747 article is a more general overview of the entire family. References to the 747A program are fine, but, unless the 747A program passes into oblivion, or until it becomes an official part of the 747 family (entry into service or perhaps before), it should be kept in its own "pen". --<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 00:50, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also Boeing specifies speeds with neitral winds. Tailwinds increase your speed and headwinds decrease it --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 20:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When airliners are compared, their <i><b>economical</b></i> max cruise speeds are given, in terms of Mach number (percentage of the speed of sound). It is possible to fly a 747 at Mach .90, but that would significantly reduce the maximum range, because of the increase in parasite drag. The most efficient cruise speed of the 747-400 is in the Mach .82 to .84 range. Some versions of the B-737 (by comparison) are most efficient at Mach .77. Both planes can be flown faster than that, but again, it will increase the pounds of fuel used, per nautical mile, if they are.</p>
<p>Temperature is the only variable for the speed of sound. The wide range of speeds, shown on tracking pages are ground speeds, in terms of knots. The winds aloft greatly affect actual ground speeds, but they do not affect cruise Mach speeds. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditorASC_5c95.html" title="User:EditorASC">EditorASC</a> 08:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page states: "...the 747 is the fastest commercial airliner, flying at high-subsonic speeds (typically 0.85 Mach..." but the page about A340 states: "Cruising speed: Mach 0.86". Obviously at least one of them is wrong but I don't know which.</p>
<p>I changed the text so that that statement is no longer made since there's a factual error somewhere and I think that everybody agrees that it's better to omit something than to state something, which might be factually wrong.</p>

<p>Could this be written better and placed into the article? <i>The main reason passenger airlines have been dropping the 747 is the length of time it takes to prep and load the 747. Passengers often complain of 3 hour waits from first being seated till they leave the gate. I'm not sure the average time the 747 ties up a gate from arrival to departure. This is costly for the airline and over the years passengers have wised up in favor of booking a smaller plane.</i> --67.3.209.74 08:28, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's most definetely not accurate. I don't know about in the US, but I have never waited in a 747 for 3 hours for it to take off. Heck not even 1 hours AFAIK. It's also most definetely not the main reason since I suspect the number of people who actually worry that much about the type of airplane (well unless we're talking about some poorly maintaned Russian thing used by the cheap African airlines) they're going to be in is small (mainly business class and the like if anything and they wait the least anyway). The truth of the matter is too that for longhaul international flights, the check in time spent waiting due to security etc is probably longer then you'll wait for the plane to take off after being seated and giving the length of the flight (say 5 h at least) for most people the extra 30 minutes or whatever (if this figure is even accurate) it takes for the 747 is insignificant... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 21:30, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The discussion above was 4 to 5 in favour of keeping 747 Advanced/747-8 as a separate article. It has since been merged into this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just don't think the subject can be fully covered here. There is already more written about the 747-8 than the rest of the models combined and if the A380 page is anything to go by there will be much more to come when production commences. As for the table, I don't see a problem. As I propose there would be a 747-8 heading with a summary in line with the other model summaries with a link to the main article.</li>

<li><b>Split</b>. At the moment the 747-8 is a paper plane, yet another in the long list of attempts by Boeing to come up with a competitor to the A380 short of actually building one.

<p>The Airbus 380 exists, is flying, and is carrying passengers, albeit not in airline service but on short promotional hops, such as the recent trip to Dubai. It doesn't suddenly become an airliner when someone slaps down a credit card and buys a ticket (although you can probably do that already, given that Singapore Airlines is due to commence operations within less than a year). It IS an airliner now. It's not a paper plane. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 21:45, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. Its not an "airliner" because its not in commercial revenue service.

<dd>Jumbo posted a year ago, and it's now going to be at least another year before the A380 enters service. However, saying it isn't an airliner because it hasn't carried paying passengers yet is a stretch. The A380 is designed as an airliner, and is the largest one ever built and flown. It's not the largest "operational" airliner, however, and that distinction should be made in the text. I am pretty sure the A380 will enter service eventually, as there are several flying already; they'll put those to use. However, it may turn out like the concorde, with only a limited number in service. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 05:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states: "The 747's upper deck was initially used as a luxurious first-class lounge/bar area. Now, however, the upper deck is most often used for extra seating capacity. Some say this trend will also happen to the Airbus A380."</p>

<dl>
<dd>Further to this, I note that the first 747s had quite small "humps", identifiable by three windows on each side. This area is (or was, rather, as most jumbos now have stretched upper decks) equivalent to a very short section of a narrow-body airliner with a single aisle. In comparison, the upper deck of the A380 is a full-length widebody. Of course it's going to be used for passenger seating.</dd>

<p>The cruising speeds that are listed are not accurate in that the speed of sound varies with altitude and the speeds listed in kph correspond to the given Mach number at sea level. For example, Mach 0.84 at 35000 ft is ~896 kph not 1029 kph. The other aircraft pages I looked at give the speed at altitude, so it should probably be made consistent. I would change them, but dealing with tables is not my forté. There is a nice utility <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/mach.html" class="external text" title="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/mach.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> if someone needs the conversion--66.253.174.65 10:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think listing the speed at cruising altitude would be fine.

<p>I have toned down the language used in the brief mention of the Concorde. The referenced article actually begins, "The Concorde supersonic airliner, built jointly by France and Great Britain, to this day remains the only such supersonic plane to operate successfully in commercial service..." which is hardly the failure implied in the previous wording. However, it needs to be noted that SSTs were never widely adopted, effectively making the 747 the flagship of commercial aviation. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 02:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is appropriate since the 747 page is about ALL the versions of the 747 and the difference between the current 747 and the new 747-8 are quite impressive.

<dd>What makes a 747 "European" or "American"? What about "Asian" 747s? Who are they supposed to get their engines from, Toyota? And why do <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France-KLM_5170.html" title="Air France-KLM">Air France-KLM</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/f/Lufthansa.html" title="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a> 747s have General Electric engines? While it's true that no U.S. customer has ordered a new 747 with Rolls-Royce engines, that is mostly because the Rolls engines weren't available for the earlier 747s, and after that point, 747s fell out of favor of many U.S. carriers. I suggest looking at <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/orders/" class="external text" title="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/orders/" rel="nofollow">Boeing's orders page</a>. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 21:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rather than having the 747-400 price in 2006 dollars, we should have the price at either the time of launch or at EIS.

<p>I made the edit to the 747-300 with regards to the introduction of an FMC and IRS over the INS. I can see why it was reverted but it was a notable change as it allowed the pilot to select from a series of routes saved in the aircraft and computer and make modifications to them by deleting/adding navigation points. Also, the pilots no longer had to compensate for drift problems and they could enter more than nine waypoints into the flight management computer whereas older Inertial Navigation System could only store 9 (later 99) waypoints. The Triple-IRS stack also allowed for full CAT-III autolandings vs the older models which could not autoland in situations like crosswinds.</p>

<p>Is it commercially possible to replace a B-747's 4x220kN engines with huge 2x510kN jets (such as used on the largest B-777 variants)? It could save a lot of fuel due to less drag and save huge dollar on lessened maintenance costs. Why the new A380-beating B747 version won't follow this route? There are no longer twin-engine ETOPS limitations any more, it could fly anywhere in the wrld, excepting the Antarctica, which is not yet a lucrative market! 193.226.227.153 20:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect you couldnt fit two GE90s on a 747 because they would not fit! Because of the large size of a GE90 you would have to re-design the undercarriage and everything that goes with being taller aircraft. It is still nice to have four engines, if one fails you have a few spare before you are in serious trouble. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilborneOne_16fc.html" title="User:MilborneOne">MilborneOne</a> 20:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>When Airbus Industrie made a similarly reasoned four-engines-good advertisement for their A340, airliners started sending Airbus executives severed horse heads, because the ad campaign scared a lot of people away from crossing the oceans on twinjets. There is no data to support that tri-engines and four engined planes are safer than twinjets. 82.131.210.162 16:26, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>While working on specs for the 747-400 page, I checked all values against the sources given (Boeing web site). I found and corrected several errors here.</p>
<p>Boeing lists the seating capacity of the 747-400ER as 416(3-class), so I have replaced the "N/A" spec with this.</p>
<p>The tail height of the 747-400 and 747-400ER is three inches more than the previous -100, -200, and -300 models (does anyone know why?).</p>
<p>The MTOW of the 747-400ER is 412,775 kg, not 413,636 kg. The pounds value (910,000 lb) appears to have been converted from lb to kg using the "rule of thumb" conversion factor of 2.2 lb/kg rather than the exact factor of 2.2046 lb/kg.</p>
<p>Boeing lists the maximum fuel capacity of the 747-400ER as 63,705 U.S. gallons (241,140 L) with a footnote "With two auxiliary body fuel tanks in the forward lower cargo hold". It seems a safe assumption that the planes delivered to Qantas have the extra tanks, as their reason for ordering the ER was to fly extended range (Melbourne to Los Angeles), not extra cargo. I have accordingly changed the "Max. fuel capacity", "Range fully loaded", and "Fuel cap./range fully loaded" specs to correspond to those given on the Boeing specs page.</p>

<li>Thanks for the corrections. Note that the design is done in US customary units. If anything the metric conversions are rounded or not properly converted.

<p>The second paragraph of the article refers to the 747 as a five-engine plane? In what sense is that correct, if any?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<li>That's not correct. Must have been vandalism or something that got by us. I fixed it. Early 747s did have the capability to carry a 5th engine but it just along for the ride.
