<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/e/Talk%7EBoer_f0a8.html" title="Edit section: No title">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">No title</span></h2>
<p>This is my first foray into Wiki Talk or editing, so I hope I'm doing good...</p>
<p>The silly quote didn't belong in wikipedia anyway so I removed it I also changed "trekked into and inhabited the Eastern Cape frontier" to "Entered and Occupied the Eastern Cape" which is a term could refer to a hostile encroachment or the peaceful one the pervious term insinuated. I don't know anything about this subject but the 'black actors' are certainally silent here and I don't think that's right. Even if the sources are limited, something should mention Xhosa presence in the area. This particular article is very shabby and should not a yardstick on the Eurocentricity of similar Wiki articles, but even more rounded ones give a similar sort of treatment. I was surfing around articles about the East India Companies and South Africa amongst others, and didn't find any good details about the interactions between black and white. Only when I got linked into an article that was actually about Shaka or another African leader did there seem to be actual acknowledgement that the actions of these people counted as 'History'</p>
<p>The thread starter is right to point out that this is a problem</p>
<p>If there are articles on wiki that do pass the "black empowerment" test I would like to see them included in the 'See Also' section of this article.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Gavla 16:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you for your response - digressive though it was, your apparently heartfelt appeal did not fall on deaf ears. I return to it later.</p>
<p>Secondly, you are right that I got sidetracked; however, in my defence, it was the person who replied to me who emphasised the war bit in my critique when actually my main point extended far beyond the naming and description of the wars. I was simply rebutting his statement. But, to bring it back to my central argument:</p>
<p>There's a difference between focusing on a particular group's role in history and decontextualising their existence. Put differently, we must distnguish between telling of a select group's experiences in a certain period and context, on one hand, and telling a selective history, on the other. My challenge was and remains that this entry on the Boer does the latter. Rather than telling of the Boere in a balanced fashion it omits critical facts and actors in this account of history, inflates the honour of the Boere's endeavours, and thereby distorts their narrative.</p>
<p>For a start, indigenous is a controversial term - one can't just throw it in there in the way that it is used in this entry and expect all of us to turn a blind eye. By leaving out the Khoisan and Bantu people (i.e. the people who must then be 'pre-indigenous', if the Boere are indigenous as this account says they are) and not telling the story of how the Boere came to be in the position of being dispossessed by the British, thus making the Boere look like pure victims, it is not giving a full enough account of their story. The consequent characterisation of Boer identity in this account is therefore a misleading 'truth'. You might deem it inflammatory, but I would preface the opening line of this entry with something to the effect that the Boere descended from the (primarily) Dutch settlement on the (what was termed) 'terra nullius' of the Cape, which was seized from the Khoi people who inhabited it. This is not a contentious but veritable point and one should not expect the reader (who may be entirely ignorant of South Africa's history) to glean this from the fact that the name 'boer' is Dutch and/or from the trekboere's multifarious origins. This euphemistic manner of telling of their history's genesis is non-specific and inadequate for an encyclopedia, especially when the unsubstantiated claim is later unqualifiedly made that they are indigenous. Yet, were the Dutch's pre-installation more explicitly articulated, the British seizing the Cape from them would be better understood (even if less understandable). And, the recounting of all of the intra-cultural wars that followed amongst the Boere would then have a clear foundation.</p>
<p>Also, the Boere "who trekked into and inhabited the Eastern Cape frontier" did not do so in a vacuum - they moved into somebody else's (namely the Xhosa people's) backgarden. It is unconscionable to obliterate that fact from <i>the Boere'</i>s history. While it is perfectly legitimate to tell a history that focuses on the Boere, it is spurious beyond all measure to tell that history in such a manner as to eviscerate their faux pas from their narrative. Far from requiring that the non-Boers be made central to this history, I am appealing for those groups against and upon whom the Boers exercised their agency and force to be described such that the story of <i>the Boere</i> is thereby given a fuller body and is rendered <i>more</i> true. South Africa has been riddled with the problem of incomplete/warped/false histories being told and retold. Let's not continue this trend.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm intrigued by your point that the white people are being oppressed by the ANC government. Hmmmm ... Because I am sympathetic to the feeling that this is what is happening, I want to preface my comments by saying that I appreciate why some of us might feel that way. Assuming that you mean by it that the economic and political policies of the ANC are averse to white people, I would like to refer you to an article written by a friend of mine, which partly addresses this very question (<a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A354699" class="external free" title="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A354699" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A354699</a>). To quote an instructive portion thereof:</p>
<p>"Does this mean that affirmative action is based on blaming young people for things beyond their control? No. It is not a form of retribution. That would be legally and morally suspect. It is a form of justifiable and necessary redistributive justice, given the historical afflictions suffered by the black majority. It does mean, as an unintended consequence, that some white people will sometimes be second in line for a position in the acceptable name of social justice.</p>
<p>The consequence of this reality has been overstated. Statistics released this year by both the labour department and the Human Sciences Research Council tell a different story. Most senior management positions are still occupied by white men. Further, for every white person “losing” a job to a black candidate, many more black candidates also do not get the same job. In short, a skilled white person is still very much a sought-after commodity in the South African economy."</p>
<p>With the inordinate number of emigrant white South Africans, I wonder if it is this false notion that whites are now the disadvantaged ones that has made so many pick up and leave the beautiful African sun you describe. In response to this phenomenon, the term has (as I found out yesterday) been coined: "refugees from democracy". In its blatant irony, it conjures up a very sad image, don't you think? If only we could see democracy as the end of oppression, rather than the continuation of this destructive cycle.</p>

<p>If I may add my 2 cents...</p>
<p>It is understandable that someone would be mortified if a certain group in a poulation's role in history is not recognised.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>The article is about the Boer and his history. It recounts about what happend to them during the War.</p>
<p>Does it say that only the Boer suffered?</p>
<p>If the topic was "The Anglo-Boer War" and it then only showed the Boer as a party in the war with no other casualties/victims then all the comment of the other User(User:163.1.173.229) would be warranted. (Please note User, that this is NOT an attact on you, I do not intend to start a mud-slinging contest and I am NOT a racist)</p>
<p>The main problem in South African society is unwillingness of groups to accept each other, their history, their beliefs and their culture. Why should it always be THEM and US? The history is not all rosy. EVERYBODY in South Africa suffered during some time, and sometimes at the same time!</p>
<p>1. The Boer were oppressed by the British.</p>
<p>2. The Black component of society were oppressed by the National Party.</p>
<p>3. Currently the White component are being oppressed by the African National Party by various means, wheather anybody will admit it or not.</p>
<p>4.&#160;?</p>
<p>This, my Fellow South African, is one vicious cycle and completely unneccesary. Don't you agree? One would have thought that somewere along the timeline a LEADER and a generation would have stood up and said: ENOUGH!!</p>
<p>As a 25 year old White AFRIKAANS Male FARMER, I say GROW UP and start behaving like adults who love your country! All our ancestors suffered, spoilt their guts, bled and sweat under the harshest conditions and watched the most magnificent sunsets in the world set upon the splendid African plains. They did it because they wanted to make a living and ensure a future for their children in the country they loved and where they wanted to be!</p>
<p>And we can still have that future... The only problem is going to be to convince people to stop blaming Apartheid/the British/Tony Blair/Robert Mugabe/the Cricket Team/Jake White for their current situation and start accepting responsibility for their own future.</p>
<p>It is easier to blame the world for our shortcomings than working on bettering ourselves. Unfortunately it is less productive and does not work.</p>
<p>I know that I strayed a little from the subject, but I hope that users will start respecting each other. Then it will not be neccesary to quarrel like old women with wet pants on the website of a brilliant Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The world might just start laughing at South Africa. That will be the worst kind of insult to the Great Men (white, black, indian, coloured, blue, pink) that walked upon the soil of this wonderful country and gave their lives to build a country that is the envy of the rest of Africa.</p>
<p><br />
"Allow me to bring to your attention the fact that they have officially been re-named 'the South African Wars'". It is fascinating that you would bring that up. Everywhere else in the world they are still referred to it as the Anglo-Boer wars - the current South African government seems obsessed with the name changing of anything that has remote white afrikaans connections. As for the name still being anglo-boer war - checked at the British Museum library today and I am correct. How many black people were killed in these so-called South African wars? It was the gold discovered by the Boers that prompted CJ Rhodes to invade the Boer republics. In plain english it was between the Boers and the British. Also courtesy of the British Museum. You cite one book in defense of your opinion but according to many sources wikipedia included "the black Africans were not considered to be hostile to the British, and provided a paid labour force." This is from the article Second Boer War. I did not insult you, I merely told you you were wrong and you were and you still are. MJ Van Schalkwyk</p>
<p><br />
Black empowerment? Very funny. Is that how you see including black people in a history in which they were more than silent images forming the backdrop (which this account barely pays them the 'respect' of being)? That's unfortunate. If anyone is being racist (or nationalist), I put it to you that it is yourself. On one hand, you try to sound well informed by pointing out that there is more than one black nation in South Africa. (True, as that is, not one of those nations is given a voice in this history, which entitles me to refer to them en bloc; and, in fact, contrary to your 'opinion', many were active - if unintentional - agents in the war ... that is a historical fact). On the other hand, you make an ill-informed comment such as that the Anglo-Boer Wars were not South African. Allow me to bring to your attention the fact that they have officially been re-named 'the South African Wars', in recognition of the fact that black people (and people of other races too, for that matter) inadvertently died fighting in the wars. Thus, from where we stand (as coevals), they were South African wars. Whether or not there was a named South African state at the time is of little but historical significance - certainly, it is of no current, descriptive value. That error is what I was trying to point out by my so-called insinuation. Incidentally, it is unfortunate that you would react so harshly to me, rather than in the scholarly spirit of discussion becoming of one who concerns oneself with the accuracy of an account in an encyclopedia. I ask that, next time, you check YOUR facts before you begin hurling all manner of insult at strangers.</p>
<p>P.S. You might want to take a look at the following book for support of my observations: <i>The Boer War diary of Sol T. Plaatje&#160;: an African at Mafeking</i> by Plaatje, Sol. T. (Solomon Tshekisho), 1876-1932 / edited by John L. Comaroff</p>

Please note user 163.1.173.229 that this is an encyclopaedia and not a black empowerment website. Please ensure that all future posts are based on fact and not offensive racist nationalism. There is more than one black nation in South Africa; not just blacks in general. Do not assume opinion as fact. Historically the Anglo-boer war is just that - Not the South African war as you so incorrectly insinuate. The South African Republic was a boer republic; there was no named South Africa before the boers.</p>

I am horrified at the silence of the black actors in this account! South Africa's history (and, I would think, by the same token, that of Afrikaner/Boer South Africans) cannot be viewed in isolation - it was not simply an engagement between the Brits and themselves. What about the "other" (I would argue MORE) indigenous groups who are herein dismissed, in vilification, with quotes that refer to them as 'savage' and references that denote them as faceless, potentially unjustified warmongers standing in the way of the noble cause of the Voortrekkers who they continue to massacre for no apparent reason. Have we lost sight of the fact that the Voortrekkers/Trekboere were in the midst of taking other people's land?!!! The 27,000 that died in concentration camps in the Second <b>SOUTH AFRICAN</b> War (as atrocious as their killing was) pale in comparison to the unnumbered who died in the wake of the carnage these Voortrekkers/Trekboers unleashed. This article makes the Trekboers out as lofty defenders of their land; what about the similarly courageous (black) defenders of <i>THEIR</i> land who are made to seem like a mere obstacle to the Boere's advancement?!!! This article picks South Africa's history up rather late, it would seem; only darting back occasionally to suit its needs - stepping over dead black bodies as it does so. I'm not saying revile the Afrikaners/Boere, but at least put things in full perspective. Give the black actors a voice in this history!!!</p>

<p>The term indigenous to describe the Boers is not controversial in the least. The Boer people &amp; culture (including their language) all developed on African soil. I think what you are doing is confusing the term indigenous with aboriginal which are two different things. A given group can be indigenous while not necessarily being aboriginal. Remember: the Bantu populations are also not aboriginal to the region as the aboriginal people to the South African region are the Khoisan related groups of which only a small amount still exist mainly in the Northern Cape &amp; Namibia. There are significant Khoisan genes among the Cape Coloured population including the Griquas / Basters / Cape Malays as well as fewer Khoisan genes among the Xhosas &amp; the Boers &amp; Afrikaners. The Boers have been called the White Tribe of Africa by the world at large &amp; they have been recognized by neighbouring Bantus as a tribe in the past.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>It would be entirely wrong to regard the trekboers as members of an exotic civilisation transplanted to the South African interior: these new-comers had become as much a part of Africa as its indigenous people and as the Bantu who, all unknown to them, were at the same time migrating southwards down the continent.</tt></div>

<p>Concerning the contention that the page does not address their migrations into the eastern Cape frontier: well for one thing that would be a subject much more suitable to the section on South African history as the purpose of this page is strictly describe the cultural / ethnic group of the Boers / their origins &amp; their history. Their impact on other peoples (&amp; vice versa) is something better dealt with in a history section. After all no one describes Anglo-Saxon invasion &amp; the displacement (&amp; absorption) of the native Celtic British peoples in the entry on the English people.</p>
<p>When the Boers moved in the eastern Cape frontier -while not done in a vacuum- one must also remember that what occurred was nothing different to how the Bantus moved into somebody else's territory as well. The Bantus moved into &amp; dispossessed the Khoisan people too, but this fact is not deemed necessary to mention when strictly discussing the origins &amp; nature of the various Bantu groups. Furthermore: the Boers did not encounter the Xhosas until a full 120 years after their first European originated ancestors arrived at the Cape. When the Boers encountered the Xhosas it was at the furthest end of the eastern Cape frontier.</p>
<p>While you might want to call the Boers move into the east Cape frontier a "faux pas" one must remember that virtually every other group in the world has committed similar "faux pas"s as well. There is hardly a single ethnic group in the world who has not at some point in their past moved onto another person's land &amp; committed "faux pas"s in this regard.</p>
<p>True social justice would not discriminate in any fashion for any reason. The new form of discrimination going on is not social justice except perhaps in an Orwellian context.</p>
<p>No one seriously believes that the Xhosa nationalist regime running South Africa has any real commitment to democracy: otherwise all of those DA (the liberal opposition) supporters who were seen on news reports all around the world would have been much more represented in the Parliament. The laughable results of the ANC receiving a suspiciously convenient &amp; unheard of 70 % of the vote while the popular campaign of the DA only incredibly received a ridiculous 12 % of the vote stands as testament to the lack thereof.</p>
<p>While you might just be able to get away with accusing the Trekboers of "taking other peoples' land" (in fact the Boer ethos forbids the claiming of other people's lands &amp; the clashes between them &amp; the Khoisan was no different to other peoples inter struggles among competing groups) it is much harder to make that inflammatory claim against the Voortrekkers as the Voortrekkers purposely trekked around the densest Bantu populations (the went the long way around the Xhosas) &amp; specifically trekked into de-populated lands to the north of the Orange &amp; Vaal Rivers. The Boers under Piet Retief (French surname) even acquired a treaty from Dingaan the Zulu king to settle the unoccupied land south of Zululand. Furthermore: the Boers were allied with the Rolong (West Sotho) &amp; the Griquas (Boer / Khoi ethnic group with Tswana admixture) during the era of the Great Trek.</p>
<p>Do you have a single shred of evidence to back up your offensive assertion that the Boers were more brutal to their neighbours than the British were to them. Remember: the Boers fought wars of self defense. While Shaka on the other hand fought wars of aggression &amp; committed a massive genocide against neighbouring tribes in the region.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>This article makes the Trekboers out as lofty defenders of their land; what about the similarly courageous (black) defenders of THEIR land who are made to seem like a mere obstacle to the Boere's advancement?!!!</tt></div>
<p>First of all: the various Bantu tribes did in fact try to defend their land -from Shaka &amp; his genocidal campaign -yet all I ever hear from you is how the big bad humble pastoral Boers are somehow the only group to have ever clashed with Bantus in the region. The Bantus were not an "obstacle" to the Boers' "advancement" as the various Bantu groups remained free &amp; independent until the British came &amp; conquered them as the British did indeed see both them &amp; the Boers as an obstacle to their imperial advancement which claimed far more lives than can ever be accused against the Boers.</p>
<p>The problem here is that you are illogically arguing that non Boer people should be "given a voice" in an article that has nothing to do with them. Taking this new standard into practice: When will the Celtic people then be given a voice in the English people article? This is just pure anti Boer hypocrisy once again. Furthermore: do you know how many dead Black bodies the various Bantu groups stepped over? A lot more than you could ever accuse the Boer of. Shaka's genocide claimed the deaths at least more than one &amp; a half million people. Let's not forget the many dead White bodies as well particularly all of those unsuspecting civilians (including many children) Dingaan killed at Weenen.</p>
<p>Furthermore: I am troubled by your one dimensional use of "Black" here as the people you refer to are not a single block but are comprized of many different ethnic groups &amp; nations. Just as there are also numerous ethnic groups among the so called Coloured &amp; White groups as well.</p>

The article states that there is a difference in meaning depending on pronunciation. Is this correct or is it just written in a confusing way? If it is correct, than some extra explanation might be in place.</p>
<p><i>Boers were also the natives of southern Africa with Dutch decendence.</i> Apart from the spelling error, is this how it is (or was) seen in Britain? In my edit I've assumed that, but I'm not sure, so please comment (or correct). Also, I've added what I knew from the top of my head, but this may easily be incorrect and certainly isn't complete.</p>

<li>The more I look at this article the more I am persuaded that the second and third paragraphs should be cut. The second paragraph sounds like pure personal opinion; the third paragraph is a précis of general South African history and duplicates several other articles.

<p>The Boerevryheidsstigting (BVS) is a relative large group in SA who is a strong proponent of the Afrikaner/Boer difference. I added a news article to the referneces about this. The BVS has a webpage <a href="http://www.boerevryheid.co.za" class="external free" title="http://www.boerevryheid.co.za" rel="nofollow">http://www.boerevryheid.co.za</a>, but is predominantly Afrikaans, would it be okay to put the site as a reference(/external link) as well? There is a document called the Majuba Declaration, which is also relevant to the above mentioned news article, but I believe that is also only available in Afrikaans (<a href="http://www.boerevryheid.co.za/files/MAJUBA_DEKLARASIE.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.boerevryheid.co.za/files/MAJUBA_DEKLARASIE.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.boerevryheid.co.za/files/MAJUBA_DEKLARASIE.pdf</a>)</p>

The statement saying that "boor" still means churlish etc in English is misleading; it makes it sound like the basis for the word refers to the Boers in the article. In fact, it just refers to the fact that boer in Dutch means farmer, and so derived to mean someone with "farmer-like" poor manners. In the same way, churlish/churl comes from the German word "karl" which also means farmer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <span class="plainlinks">Jacques.viviers (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacques.viviers_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Jacques.viviers">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jacques.viviers_5316.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jacques.viviers">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.samspade.org/t/lookat?a=Jacques.viviers" class="external text" title="http://www.samspade.org/t/lookat?a=Jacques.viviers" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">WHOIS</span></a></span>) .</small></p>

<dd>Welcome aboard Jacques Viviers. I appreciate your recent contributions &amp; I like your name due to the fact that they are both of French origin &amp; I understand that it a somewhat common or popular Afrikaans name. -Like other common or popular Afrikaans (first &amp; sur)names of French origin such as: Etienne Le Roux / Louis Le Grange / Jacques Duplessis / Francois Pienaar / Jacques Cronje &amp; Pierre Viljoen to name just a few other notable examples. I am fascinated with the French Huguenot influence on the Boer &amp; Afrikaner peoples. This influence not only gave the Afrikaans speakers their numerous French names but also strengthened their Protestant religious outlook &amp; even shaped the Afrikaans language to a notable degree as well.</dd>

<p>The following wording "are descended mainly from Dutch Calvinist" gives an erroneous impression because the fact of the matter is that the Boers are not "descended mainly from" Dutch Calvinists.</p>
<p>The wording concerning the cultural /ethnic origins of the Boers creates the erroneous impression that the Boers are mainly descended from just the Dutch ancestors when the fact of the matter is that the Dutch component of the Boers only accounts for about 35 % to 40 % of their ancestral origins. The Boers are in fact mainly a rather homogenous mix of Dutch / French / German &amp; Frisian with significant Flemish / Walloon &amp; other origins.</p>
<p>The French origins of the Boers accounts for at least 15 % to as much as 24 % of their genes. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm" rel="nofollow">Visit this link to read more about the French Huguenot ancestors.</a></p>
<p>The German origin of the Boers accounts for at least 30 % to 35 % of their genes.</p>
<p>Therefore it is factually incorrect to assert that the Boers are "primarily" or "mainly" descended from Dutch Protestants as this erroneous pronouncement overlooks &amp; omits the true / full &amp; complete picture. It would be similar to claiming that the English are "mainly" descended from Angles while neglecting to point out that they are in fact mainly a mixture of Angles &amp; Saxons -as well as Jutes- or even similar to claiming that the French are "mainly" descended from Romans while neglecting to point out that they are also significantly descended from the Gauls.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>Research by J. A. Heese indicates that as of 1807, 36.8% of the ancestors of the White Afrikaans speaking population were of Dutch ancestry, 35% were German, 14.6% were French and 7.2% non-white (of African and/or Asian origins).</tt></div>

<p>I do not have it right here, but if someone wants to fix the article I remember a couple of very interesting chapters in John Reader's <i>Africa: A Biography of the Continent</i>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 067973869X</a>. Among other things, the Boers settlers relied a lot on black populations to acquire knowledge necessary to survive, and constantly moved towards their survival strategies. They were in conditions of such poverty and illiteracy, before the gold rush, that had the rush not happened they might have merged with the local black populations or become the only white native population of sub-saharian Africa.</p>
<p><br />
Well in fact the Boers were &amp; are the White native population of sub-Saharan Africa. This is an obvious &amp; confirmed fact. See the above quotes I posted concerning this matter in response to the author of the No Title quasi rant.</p>

<p>I've known about 7 or 8 Afrikaans- speaking whites from SA and I'm not familiarised with all of the areas but they all liked to be called Boers, so surely it's just their word for themselves and it's nothing to do with which part of the country you come from.</p>
<p>86.27.49.214 10:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Not all White Afrikaners like to be called Boers for the main reason that most of them are descended from those who were not part of the specific Boer designated group.</p>
<p>There are even a number of Boers descendants who do not like to be called Boer due to the perception of it having oddly become a "derogatory" term but mainly as a result of having been brought up to view themselves as Afrikaners.</p>
<p>Concerning the point that the term is not geographically specific: this is because the Boers have moved all over the country since the past one hundred years because they shared a common State with the Cape based Afrikaners &amp; the English not to mention the rest of the multi racial / cultural population.</p>
<p>The Boers are descended from the Trekboers who settled into the eastern Cape region beginning in the 1690s &amp; into the 1700s. They were generally poorer which was one of the main reasons they began trekking away from the Western Cape.</p>
<p>The ones who remained in the Western Cape were often called the Cape Dutch &amp; were generally more affluent than the Trekboers. The vast majority of the Voortrekkers were descended from the Trekboers who had settled into the eastern Cape as nomadic pastoralists.</p>
<p>All White Afrikaans speaking people born at the Cape were originally loosely referred to as Afrikanders. Those in the frontier would soon be called Boers while those in the western Cape often known as the Cape Dutch would later adopt the term Afrikaner (without the "d"). It was the Cape based Afrikaner who ran Apartheid South Africa due to their larger numbers over the Boers of republican &amp; Trekker descent.</p>
<p>The Afrikaners were instrumental in co-opting &amp; assimilating quite a significant number of Boers after the devastation of the second Anglo-Boer War due mainly to the destitution of the Boer people who flocked to the cites in search of employment as their farms &amp; livelihood were destroyed by the British &amp; the fact that almost half of the total Boer child population died in the British concentration camps.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERon7_c44d.html" title="User:Ron7">Ron7</a> 18:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</div>
<p>The cultural difference between the Afrikaner &amp; Boer can best be summarized as the following: the Afrikaner is neo colonial &amp; tends to view all White Afrikaans speakers as being all part of the same group regardless of cultural distinctions while the Boers are republican / independent oriented &amp; view themselves as a distinct &amp; separate entity from the greater White Afrikaans population as they are descended from the republican Boers &amp; the Voortrekkers who were themselves descended from the frontier pastoralists who trekked away from the Western Cape centuries ago where the ancestors of those who would control the later emerging Afrikaner designation remained. This is an essential component to understanding the different outlooks within the greater White Afrikaans speaking population.</p>

<p>I've taken a big interest in white South African culture and I've heard unconfirmed rumours that lots of Boers' who're very proud of being white have had ancestors who have mixed out of the white race, into Indian, Oriental or Native African ethnic groups but over the 350 years there's no facial features which denote it any longer in them. Is that true?</p>
<p>86.27.49.214 10:43, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Well a number of reports about researchers who have found this to be the case would appear to confirm this. Though there appears to be very little "Black ancestry" (as your title erroneously states) since much of their non White ancestors were Indian / Malay or Khoisan. Not Bantu or other Black group.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I support the cause of the Boervolk and their right to a white, Afrikaans- speaking homeland but it seems that they can't really talk about Boer supremacy if they're part non- white, I heard an allegation against Boervolk leader Eugene Terre'Blanche that his ancestry is impure, probably unfounded but perhaps we should look into it because as in any place where settlers have re- located breeding outside of the community will occur.</p>
<p>82.20.49.215 20:43, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well I support Boer independence too for those who want it. But: What difference does it make whether the Boers are part non White to their inherent right to self determination? How is their struggle to re-acquire their independence (which was revoked in 1902 with the Treaty of Vereeniging to which they have been struggling since 1795) dependent upon or in any way lessened due to having a small percentage of non White genes? I would think that if anything it would only strengthen the case of the Boer iredentists as it is a demonstration that they are even more ethnically a product of their cultural beginnings at the Cape.</p>
<p>What do you mean by Boer "supremacy"? The Cape based Afrikaners to this day still think that they are "superior" to the alleged "un-cultured" (they should talk considering their role in the partial destruction of Boer culture) Boers of Trekboer &amp; Voortrekker descent. The Afrikaners even have derogatory terms for the Boers of frontier &amp; republican descent. The Boers who are attempting to re-acquire their independence are not doing so based on any claim to any sort of alleged "supremacy" but rather under their inherent right to self determination which is a matter they are entitled to under international law.</p>
<p>This talk about "impure ancestry" is a meaningless distraction to the true nature of what the Boers are facing &amp; have been facing for much of their 3 centuries long existence. So what if they have some Indian / Khoi &amp; Malay genes? It does not make them any less Boers. This would just demonstrate even more that they are the product of a rich heritage. The Boers would still be Boers regardless of what their genetic heritage is. The right of the Boerevolk to be independent again is something that they are entitled to under international law. The Boers were after all independent in the past &amp; their major republics were recognized by Britain / the Netherlands / France / Germany / Belgium &amp; the United States.</p>
<p>What is the point of bringing Eugene Terre'Blanche into this? A lot of people are of the view that he was an obvious foil to the reemerging Boer nationalist movement by being conveniently placed in order to attempt to give it a bad name. The AWB did more to discredit a true Boer nationalist revival than just about anything else. If the old South African government did not invent them they might as well have as they benefited enormously from their existence. It made the government's work all the more easier.</p>
<p>There were other lesser known Boer nationalist movements which did not stress race &amp; were not flirting with the extremist concepts of his confusingly named organization. Just who was he fighting for anyway: the Boer of the Afrikaner? Who funded him &amp; gave him that occult based Triskelion symbol -which is similar to <a href="http://w3.iac.net/~moonweb/archives/RTP/Polish1.html" class="external text" title="http://w3.iac.net/~moonweb/archives/RTP/Polish1.html" rel="nofollow">an ancient Polish heraldic device</a>: (see third image third row third symbol) for his then militant organization? The triple seven is a high occult number.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>Manner: The AWB was riddled with agents, informers and agents provocateur. The "invasion" of the black homeland was ill-conceived, badly planned and disastrously implemented. . .</tt>
<p><tt>Coetzee: The question should rather be asked where the <b>money came from to enable a relatively poor official of the former Secret Police to set up a paramilitary apparatus</b> such as the AWB, with its (Nazi-like) banners, uniforms, etc. Someone should study precisely what the AWB did where and when and divert the activities to a budget. Then one should evaluate the situation [to see] whether it was reasonable to expect such huge funds coming from individual sources. Another in-depth research should be done on exactly what the government's secret project to discredit right-wing politics in SA . . . precisely entailed.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Botha: The AWB was <b>a government setup from the start to open the gate for negotiations</b> with the ANC and discredit the conservative Afrikaner by linking him with Nazism. It was the most brutal and destructive mechanism to destroy the Afrikaner resistance ever devised in the history of the Afrikaner people by the left-wing National Party ministers of the time.</tt></p>

<p>Not just to discredit the so called conservative Afrikaner but the Boer of Voortrekker &amp; republican descent in particular. Remember: the largest support for Boer irredentism was in the regions where the former Boer republics once existed. The AWB only began growing when they began espousing the resurrection or restoration of the Boer Republics as Robert van Tonder had been advocating since 1961. At any rate the AWB had very little support even among the Boers of republican descent. Furthermore: Conservative Afrikaners were supporting the Conservative Party or the HNP for the most part.</p>

<p>The following is not quite accurate.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>Over time the obvious differences between Cape Afrikaner and Boer would subside and the terms "Boer" and "Afrikaner" would eventually be used as synonyms.</tt>
<p><tt>It was only after the assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd, the subsequent disintegration of the National Party and the slow dismantling of apartheid, that the more conservative of the Afrikaners (some the decendants of the Boers) started referring to themselves as modern Boers.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Some of these modern Boers[1] would argue that they were forced to accept the apartheid establishment and that they were suppressed whenever they attempted self-determination, however, the absence of "Boer"-parties in a political system where all white adults could vote, speak to the contrary[2].</tt></p>
</div>
<p>For one thing there was a Boer political party founded in 1986 known as the Boerestaat Party whose leader Robert van Tonder began advocating for the restoration of the Boer Republics as early as 1961 when he left the National Party to pursue this ideal. Furthermore: the Boers were indeed suppressed &amp; out right repressed whenever they attempted self determination particularly during the Boer Rebellion (also known as the Maritz Rebellion) of 1914 when a number of Boer Generals attempted to restore the Boer Republics during an armed rebellion against the Afrikaner-British government of Louis Botha. Furthermore: while many were indoctrinated out of referring to themselves as Boers: there were indeed still quite a lot who continued to refer to themselves as Boers during the 20th century particularly in private among themselves.</p>
