<p>The article states "The longest ETOPS-related emergency flight diversion (192 min. under one engine power) was conducted on a United Airlines' Boeing 777-200ER, carrying 255 passengers, on March 17, 2003 over the southern Pacific ocean."</p>
<p>The NTSB Searchable database has no mention of this flight. See <a href="http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/month.asp" class="external free" title="http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/month.asp" rel="nofollow">http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/month.asp</a></p>
<p>Anyone have evidence of this flight?</p>
<hr />
<p>The 777-300ER (242 feet long) set a new record, on October 16, 2003, during a 13-hour flight from Seattle, to Taiwan. It operated on one engine for 5.5 hours. It was equipped with the GE90-115B engine, the most powerful engine in commercial service at that time.</p>
<p>Boeing spokesman Ed McGinn gave out the press release. The Test pilot was Capt. Frank Santoni. Such test flights would not be found in any NTSB database, of course. I am not sure that all engine failures get in there either, if there were no other problems, and the plane landed safely.</p>
<p>I am aware of the one United 777, that was on a flight from either AKL or SYD, to LAX, that diverted to Hilo, after the precautionary shutdown of one engine, I think because of low oil pressure. That is probably the one you have mentioned above.</p>

<p>We do not have precise numbers about the diameter of the engines on the 777-300ER. Many websites claim them to have "a diameter larger" than the diameter of the fuselage of a 737, yet the only precise numbers I could find on the net were 3,43m for the engines and 3,52m for the 737, making the 737 3% LARGER. Also, in the wikipedia article on the GE-90, numbers given are 3.25 and 3.4m making the 737 larger again.</p>
<p>Thisis a very serious issue and should be looked into. Wikipedia should not be spreading uyrban legends nor condoning hyperlatives.</p>
<p>Could somebody with more knowledge investigate this and debunk or confirm the saying? We'd like numbers and trusted links. --Some anonymou sguy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The diameter is 3.429 meters. However, that does not include the nacelle, which is a factor in the comparison against the 737. I don't know the diameter of the nacelle, but it's definitely more than 10cm in thickness. <a href="http://www.geae.com/engines/commercial/ge90/ge90-115b.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geae.com/engines/commercial/ge90/ge90-115b.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 20:14, 2004 Dec 10 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I edited the article only after reading about the engine within wikipedia itself. To be internally consistent, the wiki article about the engine should also be modified accordingly to mention the nacelle thing. Otherwise, other people will be confused reading both articles.</dd>

<dd>Quote from AirlinerTech Series Vol.2 Boeing 777 "The GE90 engine is the largest fan jet engine in the world: its 123-inch diameter fan is approximately equal to the fuselage diameter of a Boeing 727"</dd>

<p>The diameter of the B737's (as well as the 707's, 727's and as far as I know even the 757's, as they are all based on the 707 orginal design) fuselage is 3.76m on the outside (for those unfamiliar with the metric system, that's 148in). Cabin width is 3.53m (roughly 139in). So could someone PLEASE come up with reliably sourced values for the GE90's diameter, with and without nacelle? It's time to finally end this widely spread argumentation... just google'ing for "777 diameter 737" gives you thousands of inconsistent entries about whether being smaller or larger than a 737 - and a lot of evidence for plagiarism, too, btw! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.247.247.238 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.247.247.238.html" title="User talk:129.247.247.238">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.247.247.238_f562.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.247.247.238">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><i>The 777's undercarriage is the largest ever used in a commercial jetliner, and its tires are the largest ever fitted to a commercial aircraft.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Really? Anyone have any evidence of this? Considering the 777's MTOW is about two-thirds that of the A380 (351 tons vs 560 tons), I find this slightly dubious (but am very willing to be proved wrong!&#160;:) ). <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantumEleven_2375.html" title="User:QuantumEleven">QuantumEleven</a> | <a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuantumEleven_5e82.html" title="User talk:QuantumEleven">(talk)</a> 15:57, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I'm not sure about the largest tires, I believe the undercarriage comment is based in fact, though perhaps poorly worded. The key difference between the 777 and A380 undercarriage is that the 777 supports its weight on a two-post main LG (with 12 wheels), while the A380 relies upon a four-post main LG array with 20 wheels (as shown here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1er_vol_de_l%27_A380.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1er_vol_de_l%27_A380.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]). This was done to maximize space for cargo &amp; fuel in the 777. So the correct statement is that the 777 has the largest and strongest main LG assemblies ever used in a commercial jetliner (even though others like A380 and B747 have an overall larger undercarriage, composed of more smaller assemblies).</p>

<dd>Tire pressure on the 777 is 218-221 psi. It's much more difficult to get configuration information from Airbus then Boeing, but it appears that the A380 is at 200 psi, which is the same as the 747-400 (190 - 200 psi, depending on configuration, except the 747-400D which is 150 psi). Not sure that this belongs in the article, though. <a href="../../../t/o/i/User%7EToiyabe_d751.html" title="User:Toiyabe">Toiyabe</a> 22:40, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps it would be better to say that the 777 has the most heavily loaded undercarriage rather than using the somewhat ambiguous term "largest". The 777-300 carries 313,900 lb per strut according to the specifications found in Boeing documents <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/7772sec7.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/7772sec7.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> vs. a maximum of 204,600 lb per strut carried by heavier variants of the 747 <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/7474sec7.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/7474sec7.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. However, I have not found the specifications for the A380, and it appears that the A380 might exceed the 777's load. Its 1,300,000 lb MTOW divided by four struts comes to 325,000 lb per strut; however, the strut's maximum rated load is always slightly less than MTOW divided by number of main gear struts, so I'll have to check final A380 pavement data to know for sure.

<p>The 777 was ingrained in my memory as being the first plane to be designed entirely on computer, and I was surprised to find that fact not mentioned in the lead section—enough to think "wait, am I thinking of the wrong model?". Upon looking at the scope of the article I realize that might seem like a kind of random thing to call out, but it is a reason why most everyone I know of (geeks, admittedly) thinks of it as an especially notable plane...and I think it did get considerable press on this issue. So I moved that in as a second paragraph. Any vehement disagreement, or otherwise a reference to back up my belief that this was a big issue mediawise? P.S. The stuff about Airbus competitors seems less useful than information about how many 777s are in service or things of that nature...but maybe all that could be folded into a third lead paragraph about market reception and impact...so I took that statement out of the first paragraph and left it as a placeholder for a third. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaeducation_c35a.html" title="User:Metaeducation">Metaeducation</a> 01:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I agree. How can the 777 be a direct competitor of the a330, a340 and the a350. The A340 claims to be a 747 competitor. The A330 a 767 competitor. Airbus doesnt really have a competitor for the 777 until the XWB is built.</p>

<p>When the Boeing 777-300ER completed its first flight in 2003, the pilots said that the 777-300ER had very impressive performance, having enough range and able to resist structural fatigue. When I say "resist structural fatigue," I mean by able to avoid breaking up in flight. This reminds me of what a lovely, patient lady the 777-300ER is.</p>
<hr />
<p>??? I don't understand what you mean by "able to resist structural fatigue." I have never heard any pilot describe an airliner that way. Could you clarify, just to satisfy my own curiosity?</p>

<p>Not breaking up in flight is structural integrity. Resisting structural fatigue is a life issue. Two related but different things.

<p>The 777 was launched and designed in the early 1990's. Back in 1990 the 777 had the worlds most efficient and advanced wing. That is true. Even when Airbus went the winglet route Boeing still claimed that their wing was so efficient that it needed no winglets. Thats also true. However now in 2007, this is not true. The most advanced wing seems to be the one on the upcoming 787. The wing is so lite and strong it bends up during flight. For planes currently in service and flying today the A340-500 and a340-600 have one of the most efficient wings.--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 02:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bangalalunga: Thank you. That is good feedback. What makes a wing "the most efficient"?

<p>There is really no comprehensive site on the net explaining what an efficient wing is. The best way to read more is get a text book on wings and airplanes. But here is some definition in a nutshell: A wing that is the most efficient is one that ballances 3 criteria and brings it all into an equilibrium whereby no one criteria takes too much significance over others. The criterias are: Payload, Speed, and Weight. A large wing can lift more but becomes heavy. A wing that has a high sweepback can fly faster but produces less lift (payload). And so on. Planes typically travel around Mach .83 so a wing is designed to produce enough lift to keep a plane flying at this speed only. If it flys any faster the wings produce more and more lift causing the horizontal stabilyzers to cause the plane to pitch downwards. This creates a drag and makes the plane less efficient. I can go on and on, but I will end it on why the A340-500/600 has a very efficient wing. This wing on this plane is totally new and has nothing in common with the wing on the A340-200/300. It is super light and strong. It is very thin for its wingspan. It has the ability to lift 800,000 lbs easily and cruise at mach .83 Even though the plane uses 4 engines which are also very efficient, it is only 8-10% less efficient than a 777-300ER. The wings deserve most of the credit. When the 777-300 first came out everyone marvelled at the engineering of the wings. With a plane length of 242 feet and a MTOW of 660,000 lbs, it only had a wingspan of 199ft!! this was amazing. It had and still has excellent low speed lift and high speed efficieny. The 787 is going to set the bar even higher! --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 19:00, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main reason for the 777-300ER's extra 3,500 km (1,900 nm) range over the 777-300 is not just the extra 2,600 gallons of fuel (45,220 to 47,890) but the other host of improvements; especially the increase in the maximum take-off weight (MTOW). The 300ER is slightly less fuel efficient than the regular 300 because it weighs slightly more and has engines that produce more thrust. Both the -300 and -300ER weigh approximately 360,000 lb empty, have the same passenger and payload capacity, but the ER has a higher MTOW. Under aviation rules, the MTOW must be subtracted by the empty and payload weights to determine the zero-fuel weight or landing weight, then any remaining weight gives the capacity for carrying fuel. This enables the ER to fly roughly 34% farther with the same payload. Even without the increase in fuel capacity, the range given for the -300ER would still be able to fly 25% farther than the 300 based on being able to carry more fuel. Since entering service, all orders for the -300 series have been ER versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part seems confusing. I don't understand how a 300ER is less efficient than a 300 when it talks about the the advantages of the 300ER below (ex: being able to fly 25% farther than the 300 without the increase in fuel capacity.</p>
<p>Most of the given information contradicts the fact that the 300ER is less fuel efficient. If the 300ER is less fuel efficient, the extra 2,600 gallons of fuel would give its extra range.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarcity_ai_21aa.html" title="User:Starcity ai">Starcity ai</a> 19:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know it sounds wiered but this is how it is. Ask any pilot. MTOW is the biggest determining factor to range. Common sense would say that all planes in the world can fill up with passengers, fill up with luggage, fill up with cargo, and fill up the tank with fuel. But this is never the case. Manuafacturers always put the MTOW below this possibility. The reason is that 99% of the time the plane does not need to completely fill up with people and cargo and fuel. Look at any airliner and their financial statements. They always say they have a load factor of 70% or around there. Nobody is constantly sold out. And no plane always travels the maximum range. Numerous routes are only half the range the plane can fly. So why have a plane with capibilities higher than needed most of the time? This leads to higher trip costs. The 300ER is ofcourse more inefficient than the regular 300. Its heavier and has much bigger engines. We always hear in the media that the 300ER is super efficient. THIS IS TRUE. But not when compared to the 300. They are different. How can you have a plane weighing 120,000 pounds more and 40,000 lbs of thrust more and use less fuel? You cant. However, there is a silver lining to all this. The extra MTOW allows for more fuel. The regular 300 only goes 11,000km because it maxes out early. When filled with payload it takes on about 60% fuel in its tanks. Ask a 777 pilot if you get a chance. The ER version can have same payload and fill up its tanks to about 95% and be at MTOW. This extra carrying capacity allows it to go so much farther. Thats why when empty planes fly they have longer ranges. Its because they fill up the tank 100% with fuel and they are also lighter with zero payload. So typically on delivery flights 777-300ER can go 16,000km. Or when the 777-200LR went from Hong Kong to London it went 20,000 km. Now this phenomenon occurs with larger planes. A cessna can fill up its tanks with fuel and take 4 passengers and everything is fine. But a 747-400 cannot. For a 747-400 to have 500 passengers and luggage and cargo and maximum fuel it would need a MTOW of 950,000 lbs. But its MTOW is 875,000 lbs. Boeing at first wanted to make the 300ER with the same tank as the 300. They used to mention a 25% increase in range just by a higher MTOW (from 660 to 775). However, when redesigning the landing gear and the underside of the plane to handle the extra weight, they realized a bulge would occur and they can take advantage of it by enlarging the center tank. So not only did they increase the MTOW they also added another 2600 gallons. Then they promised a 30% increase in range during development. However, during testing the plane performed very well and even exceeded the promised specifications. I hope this helps! --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 16:58, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
