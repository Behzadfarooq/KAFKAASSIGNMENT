<p>Very nice entry. Don't make subpages. There are no good reasons in this case I think. --css</p>

<p>We need to add some history of the company -what other aerospace companies they swallowed up especially. Mcdonnell-Douglas I think? --rmhermen</p>
<hr />
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter was listed as a product on Boeing's homepage, but that was before the contract was officially awarded to Lockheed. If and when an article on the JSF is written, it might be a reasonable idea to remove the JSF from here and simply add a footnote to the JSF article that Boeing bid and lost. Maybe describe the design of their prototype there or something, I'm not an aircraft buff so I don't know the details. -<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">BD</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hmmm, in all fairness I might just dispute the article's statement of Boeing designing the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-2_Spirit_9d58.html" title="B-2 Spirit">B-2 Stealth Bomber</a>; AFAIK that honor goes to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northrop_Grumman_1c67.html" title="Northrop Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>, with Boeing being part of the subcontractor team. Anyone care to comment on this? I'll correct it as soon as I have done a little further research. In the meantime, have a look at <a href="http://www.iss.northropgrumman.com/products/usaf_products/b2/b2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iss.northropgrumman.com/products/usaf_products/b2/b2.html" rel="nofollow">the B-2's home page</a> over at NorthGrum Integrated Systems. –<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 03:43, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to your comments: Northrop Grumman is almost exclusively a management organization that the government uses to aid in program management. NG should get SOME credit for items in which Boeing was the 'subcontractor,' but Boeing actually did the work, and therefore, credit should be given where it is due. Boeing was only the subcontractor because there is another level of management that the government traditionally uses. In some smaller programs, the government opts to leave that extra level of management out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just look at the dates in the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-2_Spirit_9d58.html" title="B-2 Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> article - the design and production was for the most part carried out by Northrop prior to the merge with Grumman. Saying that Boeing <i>designed</i> the aircraft is flat-out untrue. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricg_f5fa.html" title="User:Ericg">ericg</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricg_b3f5.html" title="User talk:Ericg">✈</a> 02:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1903, the ingenuity of two brothers launched the United States on a flight path that would put an astronaut on the moon in a mere 66 years. Only a dozen years after the Wright brothers' famous flight, a Seattle timberman, William Boeing, was assembling his first seaplane in a boathouse. This was the humble beginning of the company that today produces more commercial jetliners than any other in the world. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELeger_6218.html" title="User:Leger">Leger</a> 03:55, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you are separating Boeing and Boeing IDS there should be at very least a link to the IDS Company on the main page of Boeing. The issue about Boeing not being a DoD company needs really detailed explanation as I have seen many reverts about people trying to add Boeing to the Category DoD contractors. No one says a Military Airplane is a Boeing IDS Conglomerate Subunit- they just say it’s a Boeing Plane. So to end the debacle add a link to the IDS page and give some detailed information on the separate entities and why it is this way from the Boeing company perspective. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupercoop_2229.html" title="User:Supercoop">Supercoop</a> 13:28, 2004 Nov 24 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Despite having only two engines, the B777 is certified to fly routes over oceans and deserted zones (see <a href="../../../e/t/o/ETOPS_2248.html" title="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>), and is being sold very successfully." From that statement, one can only infer that the plane can run on a single engine. That, in my opinion looks very unlikely. How the heck did 777 certify for ETOPS?

<li>Yeah, i kind of feel like a moron. In fact, i came across the information on the Boeing 777 article. It was hard to believe a single engine could sustain a freight, but considering the engine's power, i kind of can now see how it works. Just move the flaps to the point that the planes seize to have a circular movement. "</li>
<li>The 777-300ER has been tested flying with only one working engine for as long as six hours 29 minutes over the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> as part of its <a href="../../../e/t/o/ETOPS_2248.html" title="ETOPS">ETOPS</a> trials. (<i>Note: 3 hours successful and reliable operation of one-engine-out is sufficient for ETOPS 180 min certification, based on current rules.</i>)"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I got a bit confused by your comments and looked it up so just to clarify for the rest, regardless of how long the plane may or may not be able to run, it's only certified for 207 mins by the FAA and 180 mins by the JAA/EASA. There has been a Boeing proposal to extent this but it has hit a stalemate due to EASA objections. Whether the FAA are overtly eager because it's Boeing or the EASA are stalling because it's Boeing not Airbus it anyone guess. However the ETOPS article does say several international organisations have objected (no mention of the names but if they're not European, they're less likely to be purposely stalling because it's Boeing not Airbus. Also I just noticed the ETOPS article says EASA have their own proposal so it seems to be more complex then just the EASA stalling or the FAA rushing <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 22:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Also I wonder if we should rewrite the bit. It seems to suggest the 777 having ETOPS is unique when it's not. There are differences (it's currently the only to have the FAA 207min and the only one to be given quick 180min by the FAA) and more significantly, it's a longhaul plane cf the 767, A310 etc so it's more significant to desert and pacific routes but the ETOPS is not unique so I think the article need rewording <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 23:06, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm just a newbie but is it common practice to have the main article listed under the short name of the subject entity? I would expect the article to be titled "The Boeing Company" with the "Boeing" entry redirected to "The Boeing Company". Of course, the opposite is the case.</p>

<dd>I tend to agree with you, Paul. Typically you'd see the redirect FROM "Boeing" TO "The Boeing Company" where the article actually resided. That is, after all, the actual name of the company we're talking about. I'd definitely propose moving this article to its correct location and swapping the redirect - unless someone can provide some reason this hasn't already been done. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 00:31, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the Boeing logo supposed to symbolize something? Maybe something flying around a globe, and ... some other angle-y line?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The logo was created from elements of the former Boeing logo and the McDonnell-Douglas logo. It was adopted shortly after the merger. It doesn't "officially" represent anything but my guess is that the swoosh is a stylized orbit -- representing Boeing's space business and the other object is an aircraft. Together they represent Boeing's "aero"+"space" business. That said, there was a lot of comment among Boeing employees that it looked more like Pinnochio than anything else.

<p>In both the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus.html" title="Airbus">Airbus</a> articles, it seems accepted that Airbus is leading. After so many years of being the pionneering follower, Airbus was so proud to reach the magic 50% market share figure that it was maybe a little fast in advertising it had become the world leading commercial aircraft manufacturer. Although this has been true for some years in terms of orders, and for two years in terms of deliveries (see <a href="http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/Airbus_short_history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/Airbus_short_history.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), Boeing still has a considerable lead as to the number of aircraft flying (3/4 of the aircraft flying today), and could just as well reclaim the leadership in the number of sales in 2005 or 2006.</p>
<p>To avoid constant modifications of the articles as to who comes first which year and on what figures, could we just call it a tie for a while&#160;? I feel too new to Wikipedia to edit the articles themselves - are there any oldies to back me up on this&#160;?</p>
<p>Suggested modifications in the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> article: '[Boeing is] with Airbus, one of the two largest civil aircraft manufacturers, [...]'</p>
<p>And in the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus.html" title="Airbus">Airbus</a> Article: ' [Airbus is] one of the world's two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers, with Boeing.'</p>
<p>For those who want constant update on which comes first and which comes second (like tennis players ranking), you can have the airbus official figures here <a href="http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/orders_and_deliveries/#" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/orders_and_deliveries/#" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and the boeing ones there <a href="http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>I do think it would be a lot easier putting them both down as the worlds 2 largest aircraft manufacturers. Although airbus does have the larger share, it isn't by much.</p>

They go back and forth yearly, and as it is basically Airbus/Boeing and then...............................................Embraer (or whoever it is) there is a HUGE gap between them and the next largest. I believe a rephrasing would be appropriate. I'll take a stab at it. A word to both of you though...this is Wikipedia...DON'T BE SCARED OF EDITING, EVEN IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE. There are no "suggested modifications". You can edit it yourself, so why waste time "suggesting" small things when you could actually change them? If you do something wrong, you will know about it within a very short period of time and it will be corrected or removed even before you are aware of it. It is all about collaborative effort. If everyone spent their time suggesting small modifications wikipedia would not be as large as it currently is. You can contribute as much or as little as you want. Keep that in mind as you go forward. And welcome to wikipedia!&#160;:)</p>

<li>Secondly, "extend its lead?" Airbus will have the delivery lead this year, but Boeing has a formidable sales lead this year. Industry consensus is that they have achieved long-term parity, and the year-to-year balance will rise and fall. To say that Airbus will "extend its lead" indicates a lack of perspective. <a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 17:09, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Don't want to get into the largest dispute but anyone reading these articles (Boeing, Airbus and the planes) should observe the complexity of the politics behind them all. It's far from being just a US vs Europe deal. Japan and their airlines have had very close ties to Boeing for obvious reasons. China made a load of Boeing orders this year, but it appears this was more of a political move then because of the technical or price merit. Incidently, China appears to have a closer tie to Airbus to some extent but are not stupid enough to let that get in the way of using the competition to their advantage. Airbus says the 7E7/787 is utterly crap and destined to fail until they finally come up with a decent A350. Boeing evaluate the superjumbo jet but decide it'll be a bad idea to for both of them to join in to the market so spend the next few years dissing the A380 until they come up with a workable 747-8. Still each side has their respective 'crown jewel' (A380 or B787) and so keep on claiming their 'way' (long distance or high passengar load) is the way of the future and dissing the alternative view while quitely trying to get people to take their alternative (B747-8 or A350) knowing that both views are of the future. Meanwhile if an airline decides to go down a certain route, they hype their choice and diss the alternative... China is the next hot thing so everyone decides to have as many 8s in their model names as possible. Airbus+Europe and Boeing+US accuse each other of relying on government subsidies in one way or another (which is mostly true) and keep on making threats and posturing but I think we know neither side really wants the WTO to evalute their practices. Each side offers goodnessknows what kind of deals to get people to jump on the bandwagon fast and to stay on the bandwagon while each airline and government does their best to manage the complex political and competitive aspects to get the best deal for themselves. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:26, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gah, I made an edit to the statement about the 717's end of production, under the impression that it was referring to the 717 production end signifying the end of the Douglas-designed era, with the C-17 really being the last.</p>
<p>Giving it a bit more thought, that's not true on either count though - in hindsight, it appears that the original intent was to point out that the 717 was simply the most recent design by the company, and there are other Douglas designs still in production (Export F-15's come to mind).

<dd>Boeing makes military <b>and</b> civilian aircraft. Airbus, while owned by EADS and BAE Systems, has a much more limited scope.

<p>Does anybody know of a possible citation that could be used for these Boeing subsidies? Tax breaks are subsidies? I'm not aware of *any* tax breaks that Boeing gets which Airbus would not also receive for any manufacturing it would do in the states. IMHO these spurious accusations of subsidies for Boeing only appeared after Airbus began to feel the heat in the WTO for it's huge loan guarentees that insulate it from ever needing to accept risk for product development cost. Now THATS a subsidy!</p>
<p>Zebulin 17:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC) I found a good source for subsidies that aren't tax breaks or military contracts or other inappropriate concepts of 'subsidies' and placed the citation in the article.</p>

<p>I am wondering if it'd be worth mentioning the employment dynamics in the article, for example that in the early 2000-s, Boeing laid off tens of thousands of people (some 20,000? or more?) in Seattle area alone (<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/39369_boeingweb.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/39369_boeingweb.shtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> in 2001 and more over the following years), which must've had quite an impact on the economy of the region with them being one of the major employers. I am afraid I don't have reliable sources to cite for accurate numbers and the sequence of events, but if someone interested in economics could write about this, I think that'd be appreciated by many. - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161">~</font></a> 05:08, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>That'd be OK to mention lay-offs in the relavent spot with sources cited. But Boeing is a worldwide company.

<li>Considering Boeing's current employment of 150,000, laying off a full eighth of their workforce - regardless of location - should be considered worthy of emphasis. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricg_f5fa.html" title="User:Ericg">ericg</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricg_b3f5.html" title="User talk:Ericg">✈</a> 08:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks for your comments ~ yes, the disconcerting sight of their near-empty assembly building at Boeing Field struck me, a few years ago. A mere mortal&#160;:), I'm interested in the today's dynamics: I was reading about their alliance with Lockheed and some of the research and re-design that they seem unfolding, also about fleet expansion and orders for aircraft placed with Boeing by major carriers such as Lufthansa or Alaska, and does it seem that they may be winning over Airbus, too. So it caught me curious, are they ever going to hire big? or if they do, then might that happen in the Puget Sound area, at that. I'm hopeful that somebody someday will help with good info on this. Thanks again, and regards - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161">~</font></a> 02:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, the situation is far more complex than that. One has to consider that many of the lost employees were rehired. Many of them moved to other departments (chiefly IDS.)
