<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_X-32_d06c.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In 1990 the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency_c280.html" title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA) launched the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter project (CALF) as a stealth-enabled design to replace all of the lighter weight fighter and attack aircraft of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Defense_b846.html" title="United States Department of Defense">DoD</a>, including the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-16_Fighting_Falcon_2462.html" title="F-16 Fighting Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>, <a href="../../../f/2F/a/F_A-18_Hornet_e256.html" title="F/A-18 Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/o/STOVL_4552.html" title="STOVL">STOVL</a> short takeoff / vertical landing <a href="../../../a/v/-/AV-8_Harrier_II_c9ea.html" title="AV-8 Harrier II">AV-8B Harrier II</a>. Around the same time the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) project was started. In 1994 the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">US Congress</a> ordered the two to be merged into the Joint Strike Fighter project.</p>
<p>Many companies took part in the first phase of this project, which involved drafting concept aircraft designs for submission to the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a>. However on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">16 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, only <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Martin_7877.html" title="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin</a> were awarded contracts, allowing them to produce two of their concept aircraft each. Under the contract, these fighters were required to demonstrate Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL), carrier take off and landing (CV version), and Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (<a href="../../../s/t/o/STOVL_4552.html" title="STOVL">STOVL</a>). They were also expected to include ground demonstrations of a production representative aircraft's systems, such as the Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC).</p>
<p>One major departure from previous projects was the prohibition of the companies from using their own money to finance development. Each was awarded $750 million to produce their two aircraft – including avionics, software and hardware. This limitation promoted the adoption of low cost manufacturing and assembly techniques, and also prevented either Boeing or Lockheed Martin from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupting</a> themselves in an effort to win such an important contest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_X-32_d06c.html" title="Edit section: Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h2>
<p>The X-32 featured a large chin mounted air intake and a large one piece <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">carbon fiber</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composite.html" title="Composite">composite</a> wing, neither of which contributed to the sleek, awe-inspiring look expected from a high tech fighter, though the design does resemble the design of some <a href="../../../u/n/m/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle.html" title="Unmanned aerial vehicle">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)</a>. The wing would prove a challenge to fabricate.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Boeing had proposed in the 1960s a similarly aesthetically challenged supersonic fighter with a mid-center-of-gravity mounted engine with vectored thrust nozzles, but this never proceeded beyond pictures published in Aviation Week. By comparison, the Lockheed entry looked like, if anything, a sleeker version of the large <a href="../../../f/-/2/F-22_Raptor_e789.html" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> stealth fighter. Aesthetics would play no role in official scoring, but many defense analysts commented that fighters usually looked right, though the highly successful "double ugly" <a href="../../../f/-/4/F-4_Phantom_a9dc.html" title="F-4 Phantom">F-4 Phantom</a> was a notable exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The first flight of the X-32A (designed for CTOL and carrier trials) took place in September 2000, from Boeing's <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmdale.html" title="Palmdale">Palmdale</a> plant to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwards_Air_Force_Base_d770.html" title="Edwards Air Force Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>. The X-32B demonstrated STOVL flight, first flying in March 2001. The X-32 achieved STOVL flight in much the same way as the Harrier with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_vectoring.html" title="Thrust vectoring">thrust vectoring</a> of the jet and fan exhaust. The Lockheed Martin team used a riskier alternative, a shaft-driven <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_Rolls-Royce_F136_1bd2.html" title="General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136">lift fan</a> powered by the main engine which was designed to generate more thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases. A successful design would have more payload, and thus, longer range than a simple thrust vectored <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbofan.html" title="Turbofan">turbofan</a>.</p>
<p>The experimental prototype had a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_wing.html" title="Delta wing">delta wing</a>, but the design had changed to one with a conventional tail which would make it more agile. It was judged that the prototype was sufficient to demonstrate the technology. The Lockheed aircraft would demonstrate a full transition from vertical to supersonic flight, and back to a vertical landing. The Boeing jet was not configured to do a transition, and was tested separately in vertical, or rolling takeoff / landing modes. Flight testing of both companies' aircraft continued until July 2001.</p>

Boeing X-32 with competitor, Lockheed Martin X-35 (right)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">26 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> the Department of Defense announced that the Lockheed Martin X-35 (later named the <a href="../../../f/-/3/F-35_Lightning_II_386f.html" title="F-35 Lightning II">F-35 Lightning II</a>) won the JSF competition. One of the main reasons for this choice appears to have been the method of achieving STOVL flight, with the Department of Defense judging that the higher performance lift fan system was worth the extra risk. When near to the ground, the Boeing X-32 suffers from the problem of hot air from the exhaust circulating back to the main engine, which causes the thrust to weaken and the engine to overheat.</p>
<p>The loss of the JSF contract to Lockheed Martin in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> was a major blow to Boeing, as it represented the most important international fighter aircraft project since the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-16_Fighting_Falcon_2462.html" title="F-16 Fighting Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>. The production run of the JSF is estimated at anywhere between 3000 and 5000. Prior to the awarding of the contract many lawmakers pushed the idea of retaining the losing competitor as a sub-contractor, however the "winner takes all" principle was not changed.</p>
<p>Boeing views its investment in the X-32 as a strategic investment, yielding important technologies which it has been able to adopt in the <a href="../../../f/2F/a/F_A-18E_F_Super_Hornet_acbf.html" title="F/A-18E/F Super Hornet">F/A-18 Super Hornet</a> and other studies.</p>
