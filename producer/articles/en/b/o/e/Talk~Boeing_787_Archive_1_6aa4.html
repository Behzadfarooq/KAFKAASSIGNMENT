<h2><span class="mw-headline">A 'Radical' New Plane?</span></h2>
<p>What are the thoughts on how giant a leap forward the 787 is? Is it more of an evolution than revolution? It is still a very conventional airframe configuration, and many of the systems are just a progression of existing technology than a great advancement. Composites are already widely used in airframes (although not to this extent on large aircraft). 11:07 Feb 11 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taking everything individually, it's more of an evolution, but combined I see it as very much a revolution. An aircraft of this size has yet to have a fully composite fuselage, and bleedless engines are also brand new. Compared to the A380 (hailed as a revolution by the press), which is in essence just a scaled-up A340, the 787 has a lot more new features. But yeah, it's a pretty subjective claim. -<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricg_f5fa.html" title="User:Ericg">eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricg_b3f5.html" title="User talk:Ericg">âœˆ</a> 01:46, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Technology on the 787</span></h2>
<p>How much 'new technology' is there exactly on the 787? Apart from the airframe, which we know will mostly be composites, little seems to be known regarding aircraft systems. Details I have heard from industry sources suggest that systems design won't be so much of a step ahead as the change to the airframe. For example, the 787 will use AFDX (an ethernet variation) on a copper medium - not particularly radical since this is also on the A380. The use of bleedless engines though does mean that some systems will need significant changes.</p>
<p>Any details on technical aspects of the aircraft, particularly that which can be classed as 'new technology' would be welcome. As ever, cite sources where possible for validation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Regarding "new technology," the 787 will use an entirely new electric-based architecture. Every single subsystem is revised to deal with this new architecture. The concept is a lot like the fuel-efficient "hybrid cars" starting to appear on the road today. The 787 also has a central computer instead of hundreds of individual boxes to further improve efficiency.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">7E7 is dead...long live the 787</span></h2>
<p>There is no longer much point in referring to the aircraft as the '7E7' or discussing what the 'E' may have stood for. '7E7' was only ever a pre-development designator for the programme, just as the 757 was the 7N7, the 777 the 767-X and the A380 the A3XX.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hell you say. People still want to know the history behind the project. It's part of the development history. â€”<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 14:47, 2005 Feb 10 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Discussing what the 'E' may or may not have stood for is not relevant to the background of the project. In fact, as in all pre-development designators, letters such as these rarely stand for anything, apart from when it fits a publicity soundbite at a particular time. Hence why it changed so often; there is little evidence to show it stood for one thing in particular from the start.</p>
<p>Additionally, please remain polite when providing comments.</p>

<dd>You should sign your comments. Adjectives such as the ones you have attempted to temper are explained elsewhere in the article regarding some of the design features of the aircraft. â€”<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 20:16, 2005 Feb 10 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is one very substantial question that I have yet to see answered regarding the new bleedless engines. How is Boeing going to pressurise the aircraft? Since all modern aircraft except the 787 use bleed air to pressurise the aircraft how will Boeing do it. Use of some sort of electric fan/ compressor is the most likely but I am unsure how effecient that will be. Also heating becomes a problem that was easily solved with bleed air but will be more difficult with the now use of electric heaters? I am usure of the effeciency of electric heaters and their relaiability is unproven. Answers are sought and not yet given to these items..</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese Aerospace</span></h2>
<p>Excerpts from research paper <a href="http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/papers/aerosp.htm" class="external text" title="http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/papers/aerosp.htm" rel="nofollow">"Japan's Aerospace Industry by Bill Gordon, Wesleyan University, November 1997"</a></p>
<p>"Several key conclusion can be reached from this essay's analysis of the Japanese aerospace industry:</p>
<p>Japan effectively competes today in the international aerospace industry in the manufacture of aircraft and engine components through its strategy of participating in international collaboration projects and focusing on strong niche technology areas.</p>
<p>Based on Japan's learning on the F-2 fighter program and their international collaborations, the country will soon possess the capability to develop and produce an indigenous aircraft, but it still lacks critical technologies to effectively produce a large aircraft engine without foreign assistance. Even though Japan may have the ability to produce an indigenous aircraft, it would be a strategic error to pursue this project alone due to its huge cost and commercial risk.</p>
<p>Japanese aerospace companies still have weaknesses in certain areas such as systems integration, assembly, design, and marketing, but they are actively seeking to gain experience and improve their skills in these areas by participating in key international collaboration projects.</p>
<p>Based on the worldwide and Japanese aerospace industry trends analyzed in this paper, I offer some predictions of the future:</p>
<p>Japanese companies will continue to join in international collaboration projects and will demand more significant participation in future projectsâ€”both larger percentage workshares and more critical and high technology sections of planes and engines. Japan will achieve this by exploiting the intense rivalry of the international prime contractors. Building on their Boeing collaboration projects, the Japanese will gradually increase their participation in Airbus projects.</p>
<p>Within twenty years, and maybe much sooner, the Japanese will join with a current prime aircraft or engine contractor in a 50/50 joint venture to develop and produce a new aircraft or engine. This joint venture might be similar to the successful CFM engine joint venture between General Electric and the French company Snecma.</p>
<p>Japan will never launch a totally indigenous commercial aircraft or engine program, but in the future Japanese aerospace companies will participate as equal rather than junior partners in international collaboration projects.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">7E7 second production line</span></h2>
<p>I think at this stage it qualifies as a 'rumor,' but there have been noises about a second 7E7 production line, based upon strong initial demand. We probably won't know the answer to this one for a little while yet, but probably something to keep our ears to the ground for. If Boeing does a second line, it will definitely affect their ability to deliver product, given the sold-out status for 2008/2009. -<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">N328KF</a> 15:31, 2004 Jul 25 (UTC)</p>

The <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_New_Zealand_67b2.html" title="Air New Zealand">Air New Zealand</a> order is a joke, most likely they had the order forced on them in order to get a good deal on the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_777.html" title="Boeing 777">777s</a> they were buying -<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Anatidae_6ed5.html" title="User:James Anatidae">james_anatidae</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">07</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_26.html" title="July 26">26</a>, 05:12 <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Standard_Time_966c.html#UTC-5_R_.28EST_-_Eastern_Standard_Time.29" title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</a></dd>

<dd>Well, that's why I didn't just go add it to the article. The WSJ says Boeing has 200 orders, but just hasn't made it public. That qualifies as strong initial demand, but since it's not public, we can't say in the article "they have 200 orders." All I was saying was that it was something we should note for future potential inclusion into the article. -<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph</a> 11:15, 2004 Jul 26 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, go to newairplane.com and notice on most of the pages (LIKE THE ONE ON HOW IT IS EFFICENT) and notive how they say enabled. And these are not just somebodies they are people that work for the company, just last week there was a Boeing PR rep on the radio saying how the 'E' ultimatly stood for ENABLED. OK found it! LOOK HERE please <a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/june/i_mv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/june/i_mv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/june/i_mv.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Actually, the "E" originally meant "Efficient." Then Boeing began touting the idea that the airplane was "E-Enabled," which means the airplane is linked digitally to the passengers, the crew, and the airline's operations center. Then for marketing reasons they came up with all kinds of other things the "E" stood for. In fact, they made an "E is for..." video, where they listed all the things the "E" was supposed to stand for.</li>
<li>It's important not to take these pre-launch letter designations too seriously. The 777 started out as the 767-X, for example, and the 757 was the 7N7. The 7J7 was another Boeing airplane that was devloped to a great extent and then died. --Komodon 00:45, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 7E7 design has replaced the earlier Sonic Cruiser that was offered as Boeing's answer to the Airbus A380 mega-airliner. In fact, it appears that the Sonic Cruiser, a new generation of high speed subsonic passenger aircraft after the (supersonic) Concorde, existed only in artwork and no engineering had actually taken place. Many commentators suggested it was a trial balloon offered to test the waters for a higher-speed airliner. The design proved to be uninteresting to the airlines, and was generally ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is nonsense. Neither the 7E7 nor the SC were meant to "answer" to the A380. The rest of the paragraph is obviously POV. Refs please? I know that Virgin Airlines for one expressed serious interest in the SC, before completely switching to supporting the A380. <a href="../../../x/m/n/User%7EXmnemonic_d4e1.html" title="User:Xmnemonic">User:Xmnemonic</a></p>
<p>--The claim that the Sonic Cruiser existed "only in artwork" is likewise nonsense, as any of the 1000+ engineers who worked on it (including me) would tell you. At the beginning of the program, BCA CEO Alan Mullaly said the same technologoy could either make a fast airplane of equivalent efficiency to current airplanes, <b>or</b> a plane of equivalent speed which was 20% more efficient. The airlines said, "Make the efficient one instead."</p>
<p>-- Well we know the BWB will be in direct competition with the A380, But I am sure Boeing would rather you get a 7E7 over an A380 anyways.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The BWB? You mean a fragment movement of a few Boeing engineers has suddenly transformed into a fully fleged project? Even as Boeing reps deny that any BWB designs have gone further than the research stage, and company attitudes towards it are quite negative? Do tell.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why shocking?</span></h2>
<p>The 7E7-8 variant was priced at a list price of $120 million per copy, shocking the industry. Launch customer ANA is rumored to have received a 50% discount, though that may never be easily confirmed. Why is this shocking? Is it because the price is too high or could it be too low? Also, Boeing said they will announce most of their customers by September 2004. I can't find any information on this, so maybe we should edit out that phrase from the article. Anyway, i now understand why there is this heated debate between Airbus and Boeing. It is more to do with A350 than A380. The former is bound to affect 7E7 profitability by all means.</p>

<dd>The initial list price of $120 million for the 787-8 was "shocking" at the time because it was lower than anyone expected. The Boeing 767-300 list for about the same, and a new generation of aircraft will typically cost more than the previous aircraft it replaces (for no other reason than inflation sometimes). <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanmac06_4a01.html" title="User:Ryanmac06">Ryanmac06</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanmac06_ea68.html" title="User talk:Ryanmac06">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryanmac06_3e8e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryanmac06">contribs</a>) 18:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>While I have not read this officially anywhere, I think it is safe to assume that AC is going to buy GEnx power plants for their 787's, since the accompanying 777 orders exclusively use GE engines, and they would strive as much as possible to maintain fleet commonality. Is this enough of a basis to make them down under the GE column?</p>

<dd>No, IMHO. I have not put any engine selection data up until there is a formal announcement. Someone tried to do that once before and I reverted for that reason.

<dd>An option is like a reservation. Aircraft manufacturers often have huge amounts of orders that would otherwise be first-come, first-served. In order to cut in line, if you will, they place options with the manufacturer.

<p>Air Canada ordered 787 and 777 in April, 2005 which was then recently cancelled because of labour issues. Air Canada then solved the issue with their pilots about flying the Boeings and then there was a fresh new order for 14 787s, with 46 options and 18 777s with 18 options. This new order was signed in November, 2005. So actually the order was cancelled.</p>

<li>I nixed the "contract signed" column. My opinion is that this is less important to most people. For the people that care specifically about that, we can direct them to the BCA orders page. Unfortunately, BCA recently removed the ability for us to link to a specific type of report, but users can still generate their own. This column also widened the table.</li>
<li>We should clearly explain the difference between an "order," an "option," and a "purchase right."</li>

Eric's comment (above) about keeping the table entries to one row should be noted, as two-row entries are far less readable than one-row entries.</li>
<li>The vitrol embedded in table comments needs to be removed.</li>
<li>Let's think about other ways to express information. I submit the use of color coding to represent a firmed contract as an example.</li>

However, at "eye level" (fifty inches above floor level) the interior width of the 787 will be least 14" wider. Boeing considers "eye level" to be critical in the perception of space. Originally, the 787 was planned to have 18.5" wide seats (excluding armrests) with 21.5" aisles at eight abreast seating. For comparison, the 777 accommodates the same width seats and 19.25" aisles at nine abreast. Recently, the interior width has been widened by about one inch due to the elimination of some insulation. --71.1.199.139 16:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)Tim G</p>

<li>The -10 will be put back when confirmed by Boeing. Now that Airbus has its hands full with the A350, Boeing will not be launching the -10 anytime soon. Word I got is it would be launched no sooner than end of 2007 or even later regardless of what Emirates wants. Delivery would be in 2013, around same time A350 will be delivered. Boeing wants to keep selling 777-200ER and LR untill Airbus forces it offer the -10. Most People think the first A350 will be delivered in 2013. The 900 version which needs the 787-10 response will not be delivered till around that time. So there is lots of time. Thats 7 years from now.--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 19:42, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">787-3</span></h2>
<p>I want everyone to know that about 1 month ago I went to Seattle and did a tour of the Boeing facilities there. I also visited the 787 display and had a chat with the people there about the 787. All the stuff mentioned in the 787-3 section are from notes I took while I was there. There were about 15 of us that day and we asked questions about the 787. Everyone except me asked general questions with regards to the whole plane and so on. I asked specific questions about the -3 version because I have always been intrigued by the purpose of this plane. I was told by sources there and all this can be confirmed by calling or e-mailing (Scott C. Strode 1-425-717-0571 or Adam Morgan 1-425-294-6103 or adam.k.morgan@boeing.com ) to confirm all my writings. There are no articles on the 787-3 any where on the net. Nobody cares about this variant. Nobody writes about it. The internet is all about the war between Airbus and Boeing and orders and deliveries and general stuff about the 787 program. Even after 2 years of development there is no single comprehensive site on all the details and everything. This is a combination of secrecy for the product and also lack of desire for journalists to get technical. Even while I was asking questions at the tour, the other tourists there looked at me funny as if "whatever dude, move on".</p>
<p>Boeing thinks the 787 is targeting the right market. For long haul it will be efficient and great for point to point flights. For shorthaul it is also a game changer. I would never make statements that are not true or theoretical. If you look at Boeing 777F, 2 months ago I added that parcel carriers would be intrested in 777F because they can make non-stop trips from U.S. to China without stopping at Anchorage on flights with lighter loads. And just this week, fedex orders 15 of them. Because of my previous employment I used to follow the aviation industry very closely and I had heard rumblings about FedEx negotiating a deal for a long time. Cancelling the A380 however was news to me.</p>
<p>I encourage you to contact the people I mentioned. Adam Morgan is the 787 communications director. He will confirm my 787-3 comments. Nothing is final with regards to specs however, but the general statements about it connecting major hubs and bringing higher capacity to these routes will be confirmed by him. The person at the 787 display is the one that mentioned the whole pendulum swinging too far comment. He said I quote "Thirty years ago flights from New York to LAX were on 747. Then moved down to 767. Then the 757. Now its on the 737. And Jetblue may even put people on Embraer 190 planes. We believe a correction will occur and the equilibrium will settle around the 787-3 size for major cities."</p>
<p>As the 787-3 comes on line in 2010, you will see more orders by large legacy carriers for this variant. I know wikipedia is concerned about people stating comments not cited and I am the first to agree with that. Just because some website haven't written on this does not make this untrue.

<p>Hi Mark, thanks for your input. Although independantly varified is great, we always rely on the manufacturer to give us details. Look at how many times we cite the Boeing website to varify a claim in a paragraph. Many times. I am proposing to have Boeing send me an e-mail on this. Its not hard. I can get one. Then I can scan it and turn it into an image and put that as a citation. This is extreme but if it need be, I can do this. The Boeing communications department is very easy going. The receptionists are excellent and they will answer you within days at most. Many journalists, analysts, and even the public call them all the time.

<dd>It should be cleaned up or sources provided.

<dd>This was not the opinion of the editors involved (one of which was me.) It was from trade articles at the time, such as AvWeek, Flight International, etc., and reflected what the magazines asserted that Boeing was thinking but could not say. The items should stay but we should find references. This was a pretty widespread statement at the time and not based upon one Wikipedia editor's thoughts. I strongly oppose removal, and suggest location of the statements in question. â€”<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 07:14, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. I'll add in the UTC/Pratt position that it was the fact that Pratt couldn't make the business case work: <i>According to UTC CEO <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_David_0be4.html" title="George David">George David</a>, Pratt &amp; Whitney "couldn't make the business case work for that engine." Also, according to industry sources, Boeing may have wished to rely on evolved versions of existing engines rather than the higher-risk option of an all new engine from Pratt &amp; Whitney. <s>particularly in light of Pratt &amp; Whitney's recent failures in the Regional Jet market and failed PW6000 engine for the A318.</s></i> I'll work on the George David citation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarimvibe_b78e.html" title="User:Marimvibe">Marimvibe</a> 08:35, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The other facet of engine interchangability, though not specifically stated by Boeing is â€” if you can switch between GE and R-R easily, then there is no reason why you couldn't switch to a newer engine variant that is not yet in production. So after the 787 has been around for ten or fifteen years, and a significantly improved technology arises (say, geared turbofans), then flash the computer, attach the new engine, etc...I'm obviously oversimplifying but I think my point is clear. â€”<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 05:09, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi everyone, you may not be aware, but PW is leaving the engine business on a stand alone basis. They only want to do alliances with Rolls Royce and GE on projects. They want to concentrate on their military engine business. You wont be seeing anymore PW engines as the 4000 is retired. 2000 was retired with the 757 and the 6000 has not done well. This has been the case since about 2002. Thats what the new CEO wants. He wants to make PW a smaller company with higher profits.--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 17:30, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a new PW4000-100" package that will be going through certification starting next year, and as has been mentioned they are developing the geared turbofan, scheduled for a ground test next year and flight test the year after that. Then there's the new V2500 package, which is mostly turbine changes (i.e. Pratt development.) Also, there's the JT8D which will undergo modifications to be sold on the Aerion SSBJ. And the CEO has been there for 10 years. So basically the statement was completely unfounded. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarimvibe_b78e.html" title="User:Marimvibe">Marimvibe</a> 23:04, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Show me one link, one source, one statement, one article, or one speech that says PW is developing an all new engine today or anytime in the future. A new engine like RR with Trent 1000. A new engine like GE with Gnex. Not a new variant and not a package for a fixup. If you guys go and see, Korean air and Ana are extremely upset with any large PW4000. they have had terrible fuel burn and reliability. the new 100" package is a patch up job. I love Pratt and Whitney. It has been my favorite engine maker ever since i was a kid. PW was the leading edge of engine technology. Most famous airplanes started with PW as launch engines. 737, 727, 747, A310, 707, DC9, and on and on. To me it is very sad that they messed up the last ten years under poor management and rather then getting themselves up and fighting back, they do a half ass job on the PW6000 then simply throw their hands up and give up on the commercial aviation market. Now they do engine alliance this and engine alliance that. They are not the once proud and dominant company they used to be. At one point not a single commercial airplane could survive without offering a variant of PW engine. Not so anymore, numerous Airbus and Boeing today dont offer PW. Its their fault and thats that. They want to be a small company of engineers that designs concepts then partners up with RR or GE. And on the side they can do military engines that pay well. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 23:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what you've described, it sounds more like they want to be a military engine company, with a small civilian design team on the side.</p>
<p>Anyway, such is life - nothing stays the same. In 50 years tehre are liable to be many different players in the aircraft and aeroengine sectors, esp from Asia. Boeing and Airbus both act as if they'll be around forever. But even now, Bombardier and EMBRAER are both encroaching the low end (100 seat) airliner market (tho not very well). They or someone else, like a Chinese or Russian company, could well make headway in the next few decades.</p>
<p>Remember, 50 years ago Boeing was primarily a military company, though they had several civilian designs which, while innovative, did not sell well. It wasn't until the company took a big risk on privately developing the Model 367-80 that its fortunes changed. Yes, they sold the KC-135 to the USAF first, but that didn't gurantee success in the civilian market. In fact, they had to widen the 135's fuselage, among other changes, to sell the airlines on the 707. They also gambled on the 747. I think one reason Boeing raises such a fuss over Airbus's "government subsidies" is that they risked the company several times with no guarantee of a customer, or bailout by the government.</p>
<p>Yes, it's sad when former big-name companies fail, especially if they did it to themselves. Douglas and McDonnell Douglas enjoyed a top position for many years, but is now a subsidiary of a company it once rn wings around. GE Engines floundered for years in the civilian market before finally being successful there.

<dd>Again, that proves my point. They want to be an engineering company. reverse engineer, develope, design, make kits, and so on. I am really sad about PW not being a powerhouse it used to be. In the mid 70's the vast majority of all large airplane engines were PW. They were even dominant in the propellor engine market. Where was GE? they were making toasters. Where was RR, they were bankrupt and insignificant. Jack Welch the CEO of GE for 20 years in his book (straight from the gut) even mentioned it. He saw the weekness at PW specially under this current CEO and pushed GE into engine building. RR was bankrupt in the 70's and doing nothing in the 80's. Now they are the number one engine company in terms of after sale service. They make engines from scratch and on their own left and right. Trent 500, Trent 900, and Trent 1000 are not very similar. They were all made the last 6 years. Did you know every RR engine in the world sends back signals to RR head quarters. they monitor the engines and call them in for service. PW doesn't do any of this. GE does. Look at Boeing deliveries for last year: <a href="http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&amp;pageid=m25063&amp;RequestTimeout=20000" class="external autonumber" title="http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&amp;pageid=m25063&amp;RequestTimeout=20000" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> You will see that of the 290 planes delivered, 13 planes left the factory with PW engines. That is mind boggling. The 13 planes are 747-400ERF and some 767 models. In 20 years PW has gone from domination to insignificance. Many engineers have left PW and work for GE now. As mentioned PW profits are up everyyear, but based on lower revenues. They want to be a nimble small company making high margins. Thats fine. They can do that, but I believe we should just remove the PW part from the 787. No need to mention it. Just reword the paragraph and say the plane is offered with GE and RR engines. done. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 18:29, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Are you quite done now? â€”<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 00:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">787-3 Fuel Capacity</span></h2>
<p>Page 7 of the linked document gives a maximum fuel capacity of 11,086 gallons (41,965 liters). I doubt that the Boeing would install the fuel tanks from the longer range variants and have airlines partially fill them. Smaller fuel tanks are easier to make, easier to design and perhaps most importantly, they are lighter.

<dd>If you read the 787-3 it says this model "currently" has the same fuel capacity as the 787-8. you are currect in that why have a huge tank if it will not be used. Center tanks and wing tanks typically cannot be removed because they are designed to conform to the structure. And a tank is only an empty shell not adding much weight normally. Details about the 787-3 are still not available in a comprehensive way. Thats why it says currently. If a firm spec is given by Boeing, it will be changed. The link you provided seems to me as a guideline on how much fuel to fill up a plane with at an airport (airport compatibility)--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBangabalunga_caf7.html" title="User:Bangabalunga">Bangabalunga</a> 21:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
