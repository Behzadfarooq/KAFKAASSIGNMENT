<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">9 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, during a game of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> against the Cheetham 2nd XI at Cheetham Cricket Ground in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsman</a> from the visiting team hit the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">ball</a> for <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_%28cricket%29.html" title="Six (cricket)">six</a>. The ball flew out of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ground.html" title="Cricket ground">ground</a>, hitting the claimant, Miss Stone, who was standing outside her house in Cheetham Hill Road, approximately 100&#160;<a href="../../../y/a/r/Yard.html" title="Yard">yards</a> from the batsman.</p>
<p>The club had been playing cricket at the ground since 1864, before the road was built in 1910. The ground was surrounded by a 7&#160;<a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29.html" title="Foot (unit of length)">foot</a> fence, but the ground sloped up so the fence was 17&#160;feet above the level of the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28cricket%29.html" title="Pitch (cricket)">pitch</a> where the ball passed, about 78&#160;yards from the batsman. There was evidence that a ball had been hit that far out of the ground only very rarely, about six times in the last 30 years, although people living closer to the ground reported that balls were hit out of the ground a few times each season.</p>
<p>The claimant argued that the ball being hit so far even once was sufficient to give the club warning that there was a risk of injuring a passer-by, fixing it with liability in negligence for the plaintiff's injuries. The claimant also claimed under the principle in <a href="../../../r/y/l/Rylands_v._Fletcher_9ac0.html" title="Rylands v. Fletcher">Rylands v. Fletcher</a>, that the ball was a dangerous item that had "escaped" from the cricket ground, and in nuisance.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_v._Stone_7870.html" title="Edit section: First instance and appeal judgments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First instance and appeal judgments</span></h2>
<p>Oliver J heard the case at <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_instance.html" title="First instance">first instance</a> in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelmas.html" title="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a> <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assizes.html" title="Assizes">Assizes</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">15 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>. He delivered a short judgment on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">20 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, dismissing each ground of the claimant's case, holding that there was no evidence of any injury in the previous 38 years, so there was no negligence; Rylands v. Fletcher was not applicable; and a single act of hitting a cricket ball onto a road was too isolated a happening to amount to a nuisance. (<a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">[1949] 1 All ER 237</a>).</p>
<p>The claimant's appeal was heard in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Appeal_4d95.html" title="Court of Appeal">Court of Appeal</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">14 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, and judgment was delivered by on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">2 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. All three judges, Somervell, Singleton and Jenkins <a href="../../../l/j/j/LJJ_4151.html" title="LJJ">LJJ</a>, dismissed nuisance on the same grounds as Oliver J. Somervell LJ, dissenting, held that the claimant had failed to establish that the defendants had not taken due and reasonable care, so was not negligence either. However, the majority, Singleton and Jenkins LJJ held that an accident of this sort called for an explanation, and that the defendants were aware of the potential risk. On that basis, applying the legal maxim of <i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Res_ipsa_loquitur.html" title="Res ipsa loquitur">res ipsa loquitur</a></i>, the defendants were found negligent (<a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">[1949] 2 All ER 851</a>).</p>
<p>The defendants appealed to the House of Lords.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_v._Stone_7870.html" title="Edit section: House of Lords judgment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">House of Lords judgment</span></h2>
<p>The House of Lords heard argument on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">5 March</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">6 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, delivering their judgment on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>.</p>
<p>The House of Lords (<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Porter_473f.html" title="Lord Porter">Lord Porter</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Normand_4c02.html" title="Lord Normand">Lord Normand</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Oaksey_7e04.html" title="Lord Oaksey">Lord Oaksey</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Reid_e799.html" title="Lord Reid">Lord Reid</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Radcliffe_de82.html" title="Lord Radcliffe">Lord Radcliffe</a>) unanimously found that there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making the key question one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would have in mind regarding assumption of this risk. Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that the border shot is an objective, “and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about”. The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what we can do in our everyday lives in an urbanised modern society.</p>
<pre>
 In words of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Atkin_44c3.html" title="Lord Atkin">Lord Atkin</a> in <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donoghue_v_Stevenson_7f90.html" title="Donoghue v Stevenson">Donoghue v Stevenson</a></i>, "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour."   Whether the defendant had a duty to the claimant to take precautions had to take into account the foreseeability of the risk and the cost of measures to prevent the risk.  The risk in this case may have been foreseeable, but it was so highly improbable that a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reasonable_person.html" title="Reasonable person">reasonable person</a> could have anticipated the harm to the claimant and would not have taken any action to avoid it.  In the words of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Normand_4c02.html" title="Lord Normand">Lord Normand</a>, "It is not the law that precautions must be taken against every peril that can be foreseen by the timorous."

<p>By way of contrast, a cricket club was guity of negligence and nuisance in a later case, <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_v_Jackson_5db0.html" title="Miller v Jackson">Miller v Jackson</a></i>, where neighbours of the club were hit by cricket balls several times each season. Similarly, in <i>Castle v. St Augustine's Links</i>, the defendant <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_club.html" title="Golf club">golf club</a> was liable in nuisance for damage caused by <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_ball.html" title="Golf ball">golf balls</a> repeatedly hit out of the club.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../o/v/e/Overseas_Tankship_%28U.K.%29_Ltd._v._Morts_Dock_and_Engineering_Co._Ltd._cf38.html" title="Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd.">The Wagon Mound</a></i> shows that the case does not establish a principle that small risks can be ignored, but rather that the risk must be balanced against the defendant's purpose in carrying on its activities and the practicability and cost of taking precautions.</p>
