<p>I added an item on Bolognese sauce, and it was removed with a comment on my talk page <i>The problem is that this sauce is not from Bologna... If you go there, they'll look at you as you were crazy if speaking about "Bolognese sauce"</i>. Well, this may be true, but if so, the article on <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolognese_sauce.html" title="Bolognese sauce">Bolognese sauce</a> needs to be corrected, as it says "Bolognese sauce (ragù alla bolognese in Italian, also known by its French name sauce bolognaise) is a meat based pasta sauce originating in Bologna, Italy...The people of Bologna traditionally serve their famous ragù with freshly made tagliatelle". One of these views is wrong. I propose putting back my text, unless or until the Bolognese sauce article is changed. In effect, the text has a reference, back to the other article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 11:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Footnote: it seems clear that it is indeed called <i>ragù alla bolognese</i> in Italy. It is very likely that (just as the London Times is really called the Times, in London) it will just be called <i>ragù</i> locally, the <i>alla bolognese</i> going without saying. But the derivation of the dish seems relevant; you wouldn't necessarily expect the inhabitants of Bologna to understand the English name of their native dish. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 12:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I confirm it. In Bologna (and most part of Italy) you simply speak of <i>ragù</i>. And Bo<b>u</b>logne (France) is not Bologna (Italy, called Bologne in french). --<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiopresto_dedd.html" title="User:Biopresto">Biopresto</a> 16:08, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For what it's worth, I agree that the term "Bolognese sauce" needs to be included. I live in Florence, Italy, and we refer to "Bolognese", meaning meat sauce as is popular in Bologna, more than we say "Ragu", although we use that term, too. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForeverfreebird2_3ff9.html" title="User:Foreverfreebird2">Foreverfreebird2</a> 12:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)foreverfreebird2</p>

<p>One thing after visiting bologna this summer and touring multiple restaurants is the heavy milanese influence using special cheeses (i cant recall their name for the life of me) in the risottos. Possibly the most shocking thing is that the bread in this part of italy is simply terrible. Restaurants do not typically serve fresh, dark breads, but rather things that taste of a complement between elmers glue and white superfine flour. I know that might not be scholarly, but I hope real world experience counts for something.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably you simply went in the wrong restaurant. If you eat a risotto it is obsiously "a milanese influence" since it is a milanese dish. What special chees are you talking about? I live in Bologna and I agree that it is not easy to find a very good restaurant, or putting it in a different way it is easy for a tourist to step in the wrong place. Regarding the bread, the comment could be the same, or maybe you just expect to eat the same things your are used to. In any case I don't think it is the case to put on the article personal impressions of a tourist. Ciao (next time you come over I'll take you to a good restaurant and to a good bakery). --<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiopresto_dedd.html" title="User:Biopresto">Biopresto</a> 16:03, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparhently some particular people believe that editting to link to something else mentioned within another article is wrong. Stated clearly in the article <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Sigma_Fraternity_a3c0.html" title="Kappa Sigma Fraternity">Kappa Sigma Fraternity</a> is the fact that Bologna, Italy is the birthplace of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity, therefore, I chose to link it to the category: Kappa Sigma Fraternity. I was told that I still feel it should be in an article, I should mention it in each pages discussion and thus, I am. Thanks a bunch Egil for correcting my "mistake" even though the article clearly applies to the category I placed it in. Richard.longstreth 21:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Fan-1967. Additionally Kappa Sigmas claim of a connection to Bologna, antipopes and who knows what is obviously bogus, and can in no way be substantiated. <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 21:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately I lost connection when I last tried to reply, but here is the deal. Bologna is absolutely relevant to Kappa Sigma, thus being placed inthe Kappa Sigma category. Kappa Sigma, is easily argued as being important to Bologna because of the number of people that visit the city just to view the sites associated with the fraternity and spend money there. There are merchants that sell only Kappa Sigma merchandise at the base of the Torre San Petronio and Torre Degli Asinelli. Why? Because of the impact the organization has on the city. What's more is, the fraternity is clearly mentioned within the article of Bologna and as such should be allowed to be placed within a category whose purpose is to provide links to articles related to Kappa Sigma.Richard.longstreth 22:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You didn't answer the question. I didn't ask if it was "relevant"? I asked if your site provides information <b>about</b> Bologna. That's what people come to this article to find. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:14, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My "site" isn't a "site". It is a category that provides any person interested in Kappa Sigma more information <b>about</b> topics related to the fraternity. So, no on providing more information <b>about</b> Bologna, but yes on providing more information <b>about</b> places and items related to the founding of Kappa Sigma.Richard.longstreth 22:18, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not appropriate to put categories relating to articles that mention Bologna into the Bologna article, that would have been totally chaotic, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Bologna&amp;limit=1000&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Bologna&amp;limit=1000&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">all these</a> articles may have some relevance to Bologna.

<dl>
<dd>Ok, so the fact that those interested in Bologna may be intrested in a secret organization strongly associated with the city, tells me a tag to Kappa Sigma is appropriate, right?Richard.longstreth 22:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no such fact - you are just making things up. There is no reason to believe that <b>any</b> person reading about Bologna would be particularly interested in Kappa Sigma.

<dd>I'm not making things up. I'm tired of you not listening. Is there another moderator out there perhaps with some class? The purpose of the categories is to give people something else to look at related to the subject they are reading on. Kappa Sigma <b>IS</b> related to Bologna and visa versa. If you want to debate the facts and history, go ahead. If not, then logically you must agree with me that the two are at least related historically and as such a category <b>might</b> be appropriate.Richard.longstreth 07:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not a moderator, but many, many Kappa Sigmas want to know more about the city of Bologna. The fact that this article has been edited multiple times by different people in reference to Kappa Sigma is a testament to that fact. To imply that Kappa Sigma has no connection to Bologna is quite ignorant - their history is well documented in Bononia Docet (Bologna Teaches). <a href="../../../j/g/l/User%7EJgladding_4cde.html" title="User:Jgladding">jgladding</a></dd>

<p>Okay, a few questions. I just copy-edited this article, as I found quite a few grammatical errors. First, there were two sections labeled "transport." I changed the first to "Importance" because only the first line had anything to do with transport, and the section is really about the notable things about the city. So, unless someone can think of a better title for that section...</p>
<p>Also, there are many instances in this article where something is referred to as the "first" in Italy or the world (for example, the first sentence in the "Importance" section). I use "first" to mean the earliest-begun of something; however, in several cases, it seems that it is used to mean "most important." This is quite ambiguous and rather confusing. Perhaps this is a dialect issue; but for someone who speaks American English from the south-east, it is confusing. I changed a few where it seemed obvious which meaning was intended, but there are many more that I left alone because I wasn't entirely sure which meaning was true. So, if whoever wrote it that way could clarify which is true? Are things first in time or of the most importance?</p>
<p>Another common phrase in this article is "is considered." Considered by whom? This is bordering on weasel-words. If whoever wrote this knows who is doing the considering, please include that information. If not, it needs to be reworded in places because this phrase is quite prevalent.</p>
<p>One last question/comment: in the "main sights" section, in the part discussing the arcades, there is "289 m/o.l.s." What is the world does that mean? I just wanted to point out that this does not need to be abbreviated as the abbreviation is not globally recognizable.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don't mean to start out with all complaints, but I wanted to bring up some things that need to be considered. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForeverfreebird2_3ff9.html" title="User:Foreverfreebird2">Foreverfreebird2</a> 13:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)foreverfreebird2</p>
