<p>I don't have my books handy either but this list is missing DAK "Das Afrika Korps". I *think* he was a Mk XXIV. There were at least three other Bolos in that story as well. The clearest memory I have from the story is towards the begining. They'd found him buried in ruble or something and someone had said something that had set him off and he was speeding down some road heading no place in particular, and this general from this one nation he happened to be in had been called to do something about him and was speeding alongside in a jeep and saw the nameplate welded to his side and read it aloud as he drove alongside, which caused the Bolo to stop and decide that this guy was his new boss, and then he went on to win the upcoming war for this guys side by calling in his brothers who were all in hibernation aboard ancient satellites above the planet. Surely someone besides me remembers this Bolo?</p>

<p>I'm working on taking the data from Book 3 and wikifying it. You can find it at User:Falcorian/bolo, feel free to fuss with it.

<p>Don't have my books handy, but the list is missing LRH "Little Red Hen". I don't remember which Mark it was, but it was an odd, "light" Bolo for recon to transport and support a human crew to observe the enemy. LRH was severely damaged in action while attempting to save its crew. The data records were recovered and its AI core destroyed. I believe it was a Mark XXI something. Maybe (I)?</p>

<p>I do not think the text removed by Chairboy is copyrited. It was written up by 66.36.155.48, and while it is obviously using Bolo III as a reference, it is not a direct copy (although close at points, but a rewrite seems like a better solution than removal). I don't know the exact rules for wikipedia on the subject, but I do not think this violates any as otherwise no articles could be written that are also covered in copyrighted material. Can anyone confirm or deny? -<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcorian_ed64.html" title="User:Falcorian">Falcorian</a> 22:29, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The text was indeed rewritten to avoid copyright issues, though perhaps not enough. User Falcorian seems well on the way of formatting the full history of the Bolo, so I will not re-add these texts. - 66.36.155.48
<dl>
<dd>Howdy! Maybe I jumped the gun, I just read BoloIII a few days ago, and when I read the test in question, I could have SWORN it was an exact match, because it was so very very very similar. If it's not, then I apologize. I'd suggest that the list of in-depth descriptions be increased to include more models.

<p>I was wondering if this rticle could discuss the Bolo personality. It has always been a king of king in shining armour but I need some help in making it more clear --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisuser_e51d.html" title="User:Thisuser">Thisuser</a> 03:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed references to the Bolo being 'like a tank only bigger [etc]' to 'super-heavy tank.' There's no real difference between a Bolo and a tank other than scale, so it's fairly ridiculous to claim it's anything but a super-heavy tank. Hrimfaxi 11:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC) The difference between a tank and a bolo is like that between a pussycat and a tiger; both feline, but a cat is not a tiger.</p>

<p>In the short story Cultural Exchange, an oddly numbered Bolo model is mentioned: "That's the model WV," she said. "It's what is known as a Continental Siege Unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower—"</p>
<p>"There must be an error somewhere," Retief said. "The Bolo model I want is a tractor, model WV M-1—"</p>
<p>"Oh, the modification was the addition of a blade for demolition work.

<p>Personally, I'd be interested in some analysis of the stories themselves and the varying perspectives their authors have brought to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Keith Laumer page, the "Boloverse" is one of the universes Laumer explored least, yet the one that colleagues have been most willing to pick up and run with. Why is this?
<ul>
<li>The fact that the Boloverse is so little explored compared to the others, especially as iit covers a great period of time?</li>
<li>The lack of an anchoring character like Retief?</li>
<li>The opportunity for SF authors interested in war to speculate on the evolution of the tank?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's my observation that David Weber brings more pathos and character drama to the stories (contrast <i>Old Soldeirs</i> and <i>Bolo!</i> to William H. Keith, Jr.'s <i>Bolo Strike</i>), with possibly John Ringo and Linda Evans being his superiors (<i>The Road to Damascus</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And I'm sure there's more to say about the function of the Bolo characters in the stories than their mark numbers and other statistics.</p>

<p>I've been reading and collecting the stories for a few months now, but I haven't found any explanation as to how the name "Bolo" was chosen as a replacement for "tank" or "main battle tank/MBT." Did Laumer ever provide an explanation, and if so, could someone add that to the article? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Glas McBain (<a href="../../../g/l/a/User_talk%7EGlas_McBain_993d.html" title="User talk:Glas McBain">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Glas_McBain_51f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Glas McBain">contribs</a>) 20:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
