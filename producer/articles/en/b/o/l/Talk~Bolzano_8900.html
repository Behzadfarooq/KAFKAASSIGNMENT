<p>As an Italian city, should the article be listed under the Italian name Bolzano?</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_ba73.html" title="User:Pietro">Pietro</a> 06:39, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The city could be named int he two way: Bolzano or Bozen, this does not mean that its name is Bozen-Bolzano or Bolzano-Bozen. Put the articol under on of the two name (Bolzano or Bozen) and put a redirect on the other, but there is not a city called Bozen-Bolzano. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnyFile_a868.html" title="User:AnyFile">AnyFile</a> 10:13, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the article should be "Bolzano", with a redirect from "Bozen". <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_ba73.html" title="User:Pietro">Pietro</a> 11:42, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If anything, the double name should be in the form "Bolzano-Bozen", since Bolzano is a bilingual italian city, but it's still in Italy. On <a href="../../../../it/b/o/l/Bolzano.html" class="extiw" title="it:Bolzano">it:Bolzano</a>, the data panel lists the city as "Bolzano (Bozen)". <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfio_ae11.html" title="User:Alfio">Alfio</a> 11:56, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the current way of naming has been agreed upon after a lenghty edit war, no point in stirring it up again, I suggest to leave it the current way since Bozen is with an italian majority, however is the capital city of Südtirol which is german speaking. In that case it could be argued, that <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merano-Meran_4007.html" title="Merano-Meran">Merano-Meran</a> be renamed into <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meran.html" title="Meran">Meran</a> only, since the population there is German-speaking. However for the sake of harmony and language-equality better to leave it the way it is. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 16:23, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As we are in the English version of the Wikipedia, the English more common naming convention should be used. A Google.com search in English language for .uk domains gives the following results:</dd>
<dd>- city bolzano: 15.800 pages</dd>
<dd>- "bolzano-bozen": 1.300 pages</dd>
<dd>- city bozen: 470 pages</dd>

<dd>I didn't know this project was called "Googlepedia"&#160;:-) Again, there are language sensitivities and it seems that this is the format that has been agreed upon. For the sake of harmony I would not push this issue further. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 00:11, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the summer I raised the issue of moving the South Tyrolian locations to Italian article names at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Talk%7EMeran-Merano_effc.html" title="Talk:Meran-Merano">Talk:Meran-Merano</a>. Markussep pointed out the current compromise system, which I find acceptable. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 17:21, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't a matter of keeping German or Italian names: we have to use English names. If Googlepedia is not the right way to sample common English, could it be <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080526?query=bolzano&amp;ct=" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080526?query=bolzano&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a>, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bo/BolzanoIt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bo/BolzanoIt.html" rel="nofollow">Columbia</a> or <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=bolzano" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=bolzano" rel="nofollow">Encarta</a>&#160;? <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_ba73.html" title="User:Pietro">Pietro</a> 19:32, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but if you find 99 wrong pages, then Wikipedia has to follow??!</dd>
<dd><b>Bozen has two names. Officially. In 2005. Not one.</b> Even if you don't like it.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia IS NOT Encarta and IS NOT Britannica. It is better. It shows the reality.</dd>
<dd>Especially an Italian wishing to delete german South-Tyrolean names really gives a strange impression about the way Italy treats minorities... <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFantasy_8c32.html" title="User talk:Fantasy">容</a> 19:40, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also: Why is there a redirect from Peking to Beijing. Everyone knew Peking, but "it was decided" that the official name is Beijing. So, if there are two official names for a city, we don't follow, only if there is one? Or are the Chinese leaders more important to Wikipedia then some German speaking people who are always suppressed by italians (as you see here)? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFantasy_8c32.html" title="User talk:Fantasy">容</a> 19:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the above user. Any moves to strike everything down for Italian names to me does not sound objective or neutral anymore, it is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. If Italian users want to use the name <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, that's fine they can do that in the Italian Wikipedia. And the German ones can use <a href="../../../b/o/z/Bozen.html" title="Bozen">Bozen</a> in the German one. However this is an English-International Wikipedia version, so obviously we have to be as neutral as possible. It is not easy, but it is possible. German and Italian are both official languages in South Tyrol, therefore the double names, why is this so difficult to accept? <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 23:04, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if German and Italian are both official languages in Alto Adige, in the English Wikipedia we have to use the name used by the English speaking people.

<dd>If someone says in Wikipedia "we have to..." he does not understand Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is about a neutral point of view mixed with common sense.</dd>
<dd>Pietro, before you speak about "we have to" please try to understand how Wikipedia works. A hint: it has something to do with "working together", "understand each other" and "showing respect" (that is particularely missing in your first post in this thread...) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFantasy_8c32.html" title="User talk:Fantasy">容</a> 16:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: In case don't understand why you don't respect other people: Bolzano is not an "Italian" city, it is a city where German and Italian speaking people live, incorporated as a autonomous province in the terretory of Italy.</dd>

<dd>Concerning Bolzano, according Wikipedia it is an <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Italy_9ade.html" title="List of cities in Italy">Italian city</a>: in my opinion, this point is something to respect at the same level of the rights of the German people living in Bolzano, as described in the article.</dd>

<dd>As for what Wikipedia "has to do", in my understanding "being rigorous" about the info we publish is one of the main goal: showing respect to people accessing to en.Wikipedia to know how English people name Bolzano, for instance, "we have to" publish the right info, not a compromise between personal POV. -- <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_ba73.html" title="User:Pietro">Pietro</a> 22:48, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just saw that italian and german speaking Wikipedians sat down together this weekend and found a kind of compromise: <a href="../../../t/r/e/Talk%7ETrentino-South_Tyrol_792f.html#What.27s_in_a_name.3F" title="Talk:Trentino-South Tyrol">Talk:Trentino-South_Tyrol#What.27s_in_a_name.3F</a></dd>
<dd>one line is interresting <i>"for Cities an villages in South Tyrol the german name shut be used if there are more etnic germans then italians (the same for ladin villages)"</i></dd>
<dd>Does this mean, that cities with italian majority should just have the italian name?</dd>
<dd>And that every time a "majority" changes the article name has to be changed (as it happens in Finnland with village-names)?</dd>
<dd>If this would be accepted as a general en.Wikipedia rule I think I could life with it. What do others say to this?</dd>

<p>I think we should stick on bureaucracy. Since Bolzano/Bozen is an Italian city, and not a German one, and is also the only city in South Tyrol which is inhabited by more Italian-speaking people than German-speaking, using Bozen/Bolzano instead of the other one is just anachronistic nationalism. On our identity card documents are written first in Italian and then in German - that's clear since Bolzano/Bozen is in Italy. Also all road signs are written on the first line in Italian and on the second one in German, when quite everywhere else in South Tyrol the roads are written first in German and then in Italian, or they don't even have an Italian name. When you arrive at Bolzano/Bozen station you find the sign "Bolzano/Bozen", not "Bozen/Bolzano". Bolzano is a city placed in Italy nearly from a century, so it is clear that non-German speakers tend to use the Italian name instead of the German one. Bolzano/Bozen became a big city just because many Italians migrated there (and also obviously because of the Options that chased many of the previous German inhabitants), so it is logical to think of Bolzano primarily as an Italian city. The other big populated centers in South Tyrol are mainly of German language and it is right to leave them with the German name first; but Bolzano is a full Italian town where also the most part of Germans speak normally the other language.</p>
<p>I'm congratulating with Fantasy for his work on this page, but the choice of moving it to Bozen-Bolzano instead of Bolzano-Bozen is highly and openly unfair. Also each page with Bozen-Bolzano in its name should be changed according to this, leaving the rest of South Tyrolean cities the way they are.</p>

<dd>I was not talking about how streets are translated from one language to another, but about the fact that street signs in Bolzano/Bozen are written _everywhere_ with the first line in Italian and the second line in German. That's something that doesn't happen in other cities in South Tyrol (maybe in some towns near BZ like Laives/Leifers or Bronzolo/Branzoll, but I don't swear it since I didn't notice the signs last times I've been there).</dd>
<dd>Since the street names are probably ordered on the population base, I think that criteria should be strictly followed, enforced by street signs criteria. Therefore at least the following inhabitated centers:
<ul>
<li>Bolzano/Bozen</li>
<li>Laives/Leifers</li>
<li>Salorno/Salurn</li>
<li>Bronzolo/Branzoll</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>which are mainly inhabited by Italians, as written on <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltradige-Bassa_Atesina" class="external text" title="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltradige-Bassa_Atesina" rel="nofollow">Italian wiki</a>, should have a page with the first name in Italian.

<p>If that is so, then why first name in the article title is in German and not in Italian? This is city in Italy with majority Italian spakers and I see no reason to have first name in German, a language spoken by only 23% of population.

<p>This is a good point, it seems that the compromise decided on above only works when it favours the Germans. Personally I think we should keep the double-barrel names (i.e. both versions) as whenever I look on atlasses of the area that I have to hand, they list both names usually slashed like Bolzano/Bozen. Since this dual naming seems to be an 'official' situation in the area I don't see any reason why we can't put both (or in Ladin areas all three) names for the towns and cities, with the majority inhabitants of that city given precedence (i.e. their version first). Following this rule, this page would be Bolzano-Bozen, while Merano's page would be Meran-Merano and for a Ladin example St. Ulrich in Gröden-Urtijëi-Ortisei (currently favouring the German name) should be Urtijëi-St. Ulrich in Gröden-Ortisei (80% are Ladin speakers, most bilingual in German hence German comes second and Italian comes last). I bet we have another edit war if someone tries to do anything that reasonable though Seek100 18:18, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no "favouring" towards any language. Since all three languages enjoy official equal status, it is irrelevant in that case who speaks more in what place. For the sake of order, in this case languages and names are listed by alphabetically. This is the most neutral solution and pre-empts any naming conflict based on number of speakers. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 07:38, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't Bolzen german slang for going really fast in a car? I'm Sicilian so I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, if the majority of the inhabitatns are Italiani, it should have the italian name first. On the other hand...that is so far north it might as well be Germany. We Sicilian-Americans have a term for people so far north in Italia, we call them yankees =P.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Rocchio_29b8.html" title="User:Josh Rocchio">Josh Rocchio</a> 21:11, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following Andrewa and Markussep advices given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Discussion" rel="nofollow">here</a> (as the one from Septentrionalis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Survey" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Survey" rel="nofollow">here</a>) both of those criteria should be used. I agree for the elimination of double names, but I would like to remember that this kind of choice - for the many reasons given by both of you and by who's supporting the conversion to <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano-Bozen_e09f.html" title="Bolzano-Bozen">Bolzano-Bozen</a> that such an action would automatically move the pages on Italian names, leaving German names to be redirected to that pages.</p>
<p>However, I think that this should be the fairest of solutions: removing the double names, even if German names are redirected to Italian ones and not vice versa, would also remove the question of "ordering". A user who enters wikipedia and writes "Bolzano" or "Bozen" would automatically be redirected to the right page, which explanes the reason why it is double-named. The actual criteria for choosing an only language for all South Tyrolean pagenames, given the fact that there is no English-translated name, should be that English-talking people searching for the city know or want to know the actual location of the city, which is in Italy. If the name they receive is the German one there is no problem: a page for Bozen will redirect actually in Bolzano, explaining the reason for double names; so will do the page for each one of the South-Tyrolean pages.</p>
<p>Even if I'm Italian and I actually like being it, I think nationalist questions should be left elsewhere on both sides of this barricade. Giving an only name to this page is a matter of knowledge organization (for which wikipedia should be a reference) and not of dominion of a population on the other one that a double-named page strongly shows. If there is no double name, no matter of ordering population will be taken out, and so I think it is the best solution for this problem. The rest of the pages should be also reordered, but I think they may remain the same. Of course the first thing we should put in evidence on the page of each city are the German and Ladin names; maybe someone could also write a page to link in forefront that explains the problem of double names, so to introduce people to reasons for choosing names of a language instead of the other one.</p>
<p>If this reasons are accepted (as I hope, because I think this is a community of reasoning people), therefore I propose the direct moving of this page and of all South-Tyrolean cities to the Italian names, leaving the redirect on German ones - for example: <a href="../../../b/o/z/Bozen-Bolzano_9a0a.html" title="Bozen-Bolzano">Bozen-Bolzano</a> -&gt; <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brixen-Bressanone_42c5.html" title="Brixen-Bressanone">Brixen-Bressanone</a> -&gt; <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bressanone.html" title="Bressanone">Bressanone</a> etc. Votations are something that should be left to politics, not to something scientific as an encyclopedia.</p>

<dd>Searching for either the German, Italian or Ladin name should always result in finding the article, and it will if there are redirects.

<dd>If we move the pages on the name based on majority of inhabitants speaking a language we're back to the old problem: What if Merano/Meran population suddenly becomes mainly Italian? Do we have to keep watching the census and move the pages? Remember that these pages are mainly for users who don't know something about those cities, and one of the first things to know may be that they are in Italy.</dd>
<dd>Since there are no English names, removal of double names works only if we choose a common language through all that. Sincerely, English-speaking people who live not in a German area won't receive the German name first, unless they live in the pre-World War I; since the cities are in Italy they would search the Italian name, of course, and so maybe it would be better for encyclopedic uses if all names are turned to Italian. We must think of Wiki-users before than local inhabitants, as Centrx noted on the previous talk.</dd>

<p>I don't think there will be many changes in population composition in the near future, and there's only a census once every 10 years. Meran is the only municipality where it's really close (and the German speaking majority was larger in 2001 than in 1991). It doesn't really matter if Wiki-users start searching for the German or the Italian name, if we create redirects from the other name. But I can live with moving all articles to the Italian names. (almost) Anything is better than these bi- and trilingual names. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 17:17, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a matter of what's more likely to happen, since it is equally possible that in 50 years the population languages do not change or that tomorrow all Italian people in South Tyrol and just them explode altogether leaving only ashes. If we're going to choose a stable criteria, it must not be based on local population which easily come and go (actually I'm not in Bolzano, maybe tomorrow the city becomes Bozen?); instead everything has to be ordered by the language mainly chosen by the entire community which lives not in South Tyrol.</dd>
<dd>I think I already gave reasons to choose Italian as a first language, but I'd like to support them with these statistical datas:

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>which show that Bolzano is overall 3 times more common than Bozen - unless obviously all people saying "Bozen" chose together to not write it on the Web. Shall we then start moving things to an only language?</dd>

<dd>I don't see how the Italian should enjoy any preference over the German name in this case. All three languages are equal in Trentino-South Tyrol. So should villages with a Ladin majority have the Ladin name first? and then we count the few Italian and German speakers and argue which name comes next? Where does it end? The most simple solution is to go by the equal status, as is given in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and list languages alphabetically. That would be the most neutral and fair solution IMO. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 18:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, but Giovanni Ivan Benussi is NOT more mayor, because the Italian government's representant in Bozen-Bolzano chose a special administrative commissioner for the city and this one has already taken Benussi's place today (23th June, 2005). Bye.</p>
<p>Please let's get rid of these horrible bi- and trilingual article names. The article title should be one name, not two or three names in different languages. See for instance <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natz_-_Schabs-Naz_-_Sciaves_f7f4.html" title="Natz - Schabs-Naz - Sciaves">Natz - Schabs-Naz - Sciaves</a>, is it Natz in German, Schabs-Naz in Ladin and Sciaves in Italian, or is it Natz-Schabs in German and Naz-Sciaves in Italian? If there is no common name for the place in English, let's take the name that is used by the majority of the population. Take for example the French-Dutch bilingual municipalities of Brussels capital region such as <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auderghem.html" title="Auderghem">Auderghem</a> (Oudergem in Dutch) and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermael-Boitsfort_daf2.html" title="Watermael-Boitsfort">Watermael-Boitsfort</a> (Watermaal-Bosvoorde in Dutch). Of course there should be redirects from the names in other languages, and they should be mentioned in the first line of the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 13:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The criterion is what most people use <i>when speaking English</i>. This includes people whose native language is not English of course. As many people speak English at least occasionally, in many areas (such as France where English is a compulsory school subject) the local usage of the name in English will drown out any usage by outsiders. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 06:32, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't doubt that it <b>is</b> the Italian name, I don't really care either way. What I'm looking for is evidence as to whether or not people use this name <i>when speaking English</i>.

<dd>I'm coming more and more to realise that there is no perfect answer to this one. IMO <b>both</b> names are probably acceptable, but we need to use one or the other. The problem is, to use either has political implications. This is a common problem with place names in multilingual areas. In that we're <b>forced</b> by our software and naming conventions to choose one name for the article, that choice shouldn't be seen as support by English Wikipedia for there even <b>being</b> a preferred name, let alone by implication for the territorial claims of an ethnic group.</dd>

<dd>I'm not proposing complete removal of Bozen, just from the article name. There are several contexts in which "Bozen" should be used, for instance pre-1918 history, births, deaths etc. And Bozen will be/stay in the first line of the article, as the German name. BTW the slash doesn't make it better in my opinion, nobody calls it Bozen/Bolzano either. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 16:24, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a bit divided now. I checked many other bilingual cities and they seem to bear just one name in the title of their respective articles. I could just change my stance to neutral, but I'm also not very fond of the "(city)" addition, considering that Bolzano/Bozen as city is likely the most common search. BTW, the slash doesn't mean that when referring to the name, both words are to be pronounced (that would happen with the hiphen). The slash just means that two forms exist and you may choose the one you prefer when referring to the city.--<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">Hús</a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">nd</a> 17:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

This does not sound to me as an opinion on this could have an influence on all the other pages.

<dd>You started it a little bit the wrong way. Maybe if you rethink about what you/we want to achieve we find a way all can agree on how to preceed.

<dd>Isn't it perfectly clear? My proposal is to move all municipalities to their Italian names. Since <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a> is taken by a disambiguation page (there's a mathematician Bolzano), that's an exception. If it makes you feel better, I'll change the title. BTW this proposal is the result of a discussion I had some days ago (see below). That's why I didn't include other options, such as everything German, or everything to the name in the majority language of the municipality. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 21:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is still some room for discussion, see above. This is essentially, however, a simple question: double name or single name? The approval poll will be a bit of a problem for the closing admin, but not too big a one. I doubt the wisdom of a&#160;!vote on all South Tyrolean names; there may be different arguments for Bolzano and for some barely notable hamlet on the side of an Alp; but I would bear this in mind when voting on the hamlet's article. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article should be moved to whatever its most common denomination in English is (lest we forget, this is English Wikipedia).

<p>The problem is, that for some places in South Tyrol the german name is more common, for some the italian. How do we decide what name is used for what place?</p>
<p>In South Tyrol we have officially two languages. How do you want to decide which one is more important.</p>
<p>Simply saying "lets take italian" means: I come from a place where 0 Null zero no niente Italians are living. Its a german place. No one uses the invented italian name. It did not exist until an italian came and tried to impose it without success. And now WIkipedia comes and imposes the italian name on all german speaking people in that place?</p>
<p>Think about what power Wikipedia has, and what you are doing to the minorities with simple answers to complicated questions. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> 22:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we have agreed this discussion is *only* about Bolzano. As for the rest, whatever its most common name in English is should be chosen.

<dd>This is a too simple answer. You can not change one South Tyrolean name (the main city!) without influencing the rest. It's a wrong milestone. We need a Solution for all names of South Tyrol. <i>"As for the rest, whatever its most common name in English "</i> is the wrong answer. You mean, we have 2000 discussions like this in 2000 pages??!! That is not a solution. Or do you really mean that?! <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> 06:06, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fantasy, you're reasoning in terms of the place where you live, not from a neutral point of view. It is equally obvious that in a place in Italy where no one speaks German everyone will refer to the city as Bolzano and not Bozen.</dd>
<dd>Again, choosing a language on the other is NOT a matter of offending a people instead of another one. I personally think only very stupid people will offend themselves just because on an encyclopedia - which tends to be <i>general</i> - of another language it is preferred the name of a language instead of the other one. There is simply no political meaning behind that, whereas the title "Bozen-Bolzano" displays it a more clear preponderance of a group to another one.</dd>
<dd>To me - and to all reasoning people, I think - makes absolutely NO difference if the language chosen for ALL cities in South Tyrol is German or Italian ('cause the proposal of Markussep was just the start of this global convertion process). The reasons why Italian should be a better choice are widely explained in a previous topic.</dd>
<dd>I sincerely think that when the page will be moved to an only language, indifferently whether it would be German or Italian, all those questions of "offending" a part of the population will be quite completely forgotten.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, you will see that you're the only one that's turning that problem to a gigantic size, by opening several threads trying to complicate something that is really simple when viewed from a logical side. Here there should be no space for nationalisms, from both sides. Making a final report on what we've found since now:
<ul>
<li>double and triple names should be removed, since:
<ul>
<li>1. they show a priority of a language to another;</li>
<li>2. they create ridiculously long pagenames, which on an encyclopedia - an organized system of notions that tends to be strict and direct - should be avoided at first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the name should be chosen based on naming conventions, which consider the English-speaking community and the overall-speaking community.</li>
<li>answering to Gryffindor arguments, the English name is not necessarily a translated one, since in every language there are a lot of words taken from other languages which have become also part of the new language (for example, in Italian there is no other word for "computer", so "computer" has become an official Italian word). The language is born not by scientifically analizing the terms, but by <i>common use and acceptance</i> of certain words.</li>
<li>therefore the choice for the English wikipedia should be done based on popularity of the name. Google is a good statistical instrument for that sake. By looking at google.com you may see that quite all little cities in South Tyrol have equal pagecounts, with little prevalence of a language on another (for example, Meran has more pages than Merano, Brunico more than Bruneck, Vipiteno more than Sterzing, Brixen more than Bressanone etc). But for all towns where Italian-speaking people are more than German-speaking one the pagecounts are enormously unbalanced on Italian side - Bolzano has 3 times the pagecounts of Bozen, Laives 2.5 times the ones of Leifers, Bronzolo 2 times the ones of Branzoll, Salorno 1.5 times the ones of Salurn.</li>
<li>since there is such a great unbalance on names, based on the obvious reason that <i>Italian</i> names of <i>Italian</i> cities are more widely spread among the <i>entire</i> speaking community, therefore the Italian names should be preferred <b>for ALL South Tyrolean cities</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We're not considering local disputes, which are left to people who cannot see further than their own nose. From the possibly widest point of view, South Tyrol is still part of Italy, and since this is not a South Tyrolean wikipedia but an English one - I'd rather say international - we should forget that double language problem.</dd>
<dd>If you find reasons for German names to be chosen instead of Italian, well, you may explain it here and discuss with the others. But the reiteration of things you continue to say from months without reading what the others write is not discussion. I think that people from Germany or from other parts of Italy don't even care of those double names, which are a problem taken out by German-speaking Southtyroleans first and Italian-speaking Southtyroleans second. Septentrionalis and Markussep easily agreed for the remotion of double names and the choice of an only language (which I previously supposed should be Italian); I think they are no Southtyroleans at all, and then may gain a much more neutral point of view rather than people who lives or lived in South Tyrol like me and you. Should we continue forever by complicating these stupid (sorry for the aggressive term) problems?</dd>

<p>I think it is ludicruous to try to force a single name "in English". There is an Italian version and there is a German version, both of which are official and equal. So both versions are correct. Obviously a solution has to be found that can satisfy both sides, instead of forcing one version on the other. Because if you change one city, what about the other ones, it would be a complete mess? <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 07:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny, because you yourself have pushed for a single name in English for the Province of Bolzano (i.e. your South Tyrol). I've never witnessed such hypocritical behavior...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see I opened Pandora's box here. It's not my intention to suppress minorities or something like that. I hope that most users understand that the present double or triple names are unworkable and unencyclopedic. Equal official status of two names doesn't mean that both names must be used all the time. I don't really care which name is chosen, but a choice must be made! The idea of making a guideline for it is fine with me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 08:24, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I think the current way is a good equilibrium. It has both the Italian and the German version in it, why try to force a version that many of the local inhabitants would see as "colonial" and "fascist"? I am not from that area, but I am very much aware of the sensitivities surrounding this issue and I think we need to thread very carefully here. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 09:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually anticipated you and did that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Don.27t_use_simple_answers_to_complicated_questions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bozen-Bolzano#Don.27t_use_simple_answers_to_complicated_questions" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I tested Google on a certain number of important citynames in South Tyrol, and as a result there is a sort of balance (NOT preponderance) on cities where German is the main language; instead, in cities where Italian is the main language there is a big prevalence for the Italian name.</dd>
<dd>The reason might be that the biggest part of the province, where German-speakers are the most, consists in places which are quite rural and detached, so they don't spread the German names in many places outside their homes. That obviously make the Italian names more proper for the task.</dd>
<dd>Also I add that, since South Tyrol is an Italian province, even the places for tourists have to learn a little Italian; where most of Italian Southtyroleans, knowing they're in Italy, don't actually have the need to learn German for their living.</dd>
<dd>These things are something normal for the local people; German Southtyroleans don't feel themselves "German", they feel "Southtyrolean". Italian Southtyroleans feel themselves Italian and Southtyrolean.</dd>

<dd>Also, Bressanone was probably more notable in the eighteenth century, when it was the capital of a sovereign bishopric, than it is now; and anglophones called it Brixen then.

<dd>You'll probably find different results if you only search in English books or scientific articles. I think it's safe to say that except for Bolzano, Meran and maybe Brixen there are few places in South Tyrol that are frequently mentioned in English language publications. You're right BTW, my only connection with South Tyrol is that I spent some days in Meran in '95 (nice town). IMO, there are three consistent ways to name all municipalities:</dd>
</dl>
<p>A - all Italian (rationale: they're in Italy)</p>
<p>B - all German (rationale: German speaking majority in South Tyrol)</p>
<p>C - all in the language of the local majority (103 German, 5 Italian, 8 Ladin, see my 2001 census based list here: <a href="#Removal_of_double_names" title="">#Removal of double names</a>)</p>
<p>Exceptions should be made for towns that have a single widely used name in English. Shall we put this up for a survey? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 17:49, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops; I did search English only, and posted the wrong URL; I hope that's fixed now. I would prefer to make the exception: <i>where a preference in English usage can be determined</i>; but that's still going to exclude most places.

<p>The result of the survey in a nutshell: if there's a commonly used name for the place in English, use that.

You have to realize that there is a long history on the WP of Austrisns (namely Gryffindor) that have pushed for a naming convention on WP that emphasize a German POV.

That, and that is the official name of the city, capturing both the Italian and German names for the city, since the Province of Bolzano-Bozen (BZ) is ethnically mixed.

<p>I don't mean to make a personal attack on this individual, but the method that he has systematically had Bolzano-Bozen renamed as Bozen-Bolzano. The Province of Bolzano-Bozen (BZ) now referred to as the Province of South Tyrol.. and the region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol referred to as Trentino-South Tyrol is quite creepy, to say the least. I read in the discussion above where Gryffindor writes, "I didn't know this project was called "Googlepedia"&#160;:-) Again, there are language sensitivities and it seems that this is the format that has been agreed upon. For the sake of harmony I would not push this issue further." Yes, of course he doesn't want to push it anymore, because it is now how he desires it (i.e. his own harmony). This process has been of the most scary I've seen on the WP and actually is foremost the type of "work" that discredits this project. Taalo 20:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Italian name is Bolzano. This is the name used commonly on English maps, etc. There is no English equivalent to Bolzano (Italian) or Bozen (German). As this is an Italian city, in a mixed Italian-German area, it makes sense to me that we list both names as Italian-German. This is not to step on anyone's toes, it shouldn't matter what is first or second (though it appears to have mattered to some...). Anyway, if you even see the main sign entering Bolzano-Bozen.. it says just that: BOLZANO-BOZEN. So, lets please not use Bolzano, Italy; Bozen, Italy, Bozen-Bolzano, Bozen, Bolzano. Please use what is used in the region: Bolzano-Bozen. Now let the POVs, I mean discussions, begin.&#160;:) Taalo 08:47, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b>. This city is in Italy and majority of its population speak Italian, thus I do not see one single reason to have German name first. South Tyrol is autonomous entity and I do not see a problem if German names are used for the places of South Tyrol in which majority of population speak German. But this city is not one of those places.

<dd>Ok, as I've said before. In theory it is an approach. In practical implementation it is kind of crazy. The example of Merano-Meran where the population is 50/50.

<li>(reposted from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> talk) <b>Here we go</b>: My hypothesis to why a lot of this debate is going on is the following. <b>If</b> this region was not part of Italy now, but instead was part of Austria, in all likelyhood the Province would be called Sudtirol (aka South Tyrol). If the ethnic Italians would have enjoyed the same rights as the ethnic Germans now do, we will never know. That said, I commend that the German people of the region stood up for their rights, and that we have the situation we have now, the people who have lived here for centuries (Italians and Germans) living in peace. Going back to the hypothetical argument that if Austria had retained control after the breakup of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. If the local Italians would have no say, most likely the province would of been called the Province of Sudtirol (as this is the common way to name provinces in Austria). The cities would of likely retained only their German names: Meran, Bozen, Brixen, etc., etc. As I have ancestors from Austria, I sincerely <b>hope</b> that they would of done a mirror of what exists in Italy now (i.e., naming cities Bozen-Bolzano, Meran-Merano, etc.). But I can only hope and guess. Now, the reality of how things did come to end is that the Italian gov't has control of the region. The Italian convention of naming provinces is by the major city of the province (and I've gone over this a lot above, and I find it hard to see now this is debatable). So, therefore the province (by this simple method) is called the Province of Bolzano (or Provinz Bozen in German). In fact, I find it even harder to believe that any average neutral non-political guy/gal in Bolzano/Bozen will not agree the province is called Bolzano/Bozen. Now, what I find disturbing in all of this, and I'll let you all be the judge, is when I see an insistence by primarily Austrian/German individuals (and mostly all not even from the region) to call the province <b>Province of South Tyrol</b>, the region Trentino-<b>South Tyrol</b>, and work on making the city names either <b>Brenner</b>, Italy or <b>Bozen</b>-Bolzano -- I feel sickened. Why? If you read the basic history I have outlined, I hope you can see that this mindset would be what an extremist minority would hope to convey -- because for all intents and purposes -- it is the naming convention that <b>would of</b> existed had Austria retained this area! Now, I know not everyone who is supporting using South Tyrol is German/Italian/etc., so don't blindside me with that argument please. I'm not trying to generalize or accuse German/Austrians. I'm just pointing out what I have seen. Anway, to me, whose family is from this region, I find this discusting that individuals would try to migrate the names to a <b>would of been</b> convention. Sorry, but that is my opinion. I have absolutely no problem with the history of the region (as long as it is done fairly). My culture is Trentino/Tirol/Tirolese. My background has "Italian" and "Austrian" roots.. though by far if you look in the archives and cemetaries, much of all our roots are firmly from Rome and Latin. This is really a family squable, because the people are all the same. I have Italian relatives that are blonde-blue eyed and look similar to user Fantasy.&#160;:) I have others that are dark haired and darker skin. All these relatives have their family tree tracable for literally centuries through the local churches. Anyway, by rights, and going by the rules of Wikipedia the cities should be in Italian, the region should be Trento-Alto Adige to preserve neutrality and the province should be the Province of Bolzano. But this risks a war going on forever, especially from those who have these extreme views I detailed before. So going all Italian is not a good way (and I don't buy this English in English wikipedia -- these places <b>do not</b> have straightforward English names. I am a native English speaker, I have some clue on this!). Going with the ultra-South-Tyrol mode of trying to move everything to how it <b>might of been</b> if the Austrian Gov't would of retained control is even worse --- <b>far worse</b>. Downright horrendous in fact. That is why I have said over and over again, for this special region in Italy, use the Italian-German as has been actually used in the region. The cities can be Bolzano-Bozen or Bolzano (Bozen). The province can be Province of Bolzano-Bozen or Province of Bolzano (Bozen). I would prefer to have the region as Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol or Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol. Something that maintains neutrality. People saying that the area is South Tyrol in English when arguing the province should be Province of South Tyrol are either absolutely oblivious to the history and reality of this region or are trying to push through a German POV. Anyway, I hope my small dissertation&#160;:) has helped a little bit to understand the cities, provinces, regions, and issues this brings up. The culture of this region is sharing.. everyone needs to back the heck up and realize this, and also think of how this page can be the most neutral and fair. Not an attempt to re-write history through WP or fantasies of the province being part of Greater Austria. Life is too short, doesn't this simple-minded stuff not get old? To the individuals who made it their purpose in life to start this a year ago.. come on guys, go down and visit the rivers and mountains and -- RELAX. regards. Taalo 23:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let's break new ground man! LOL... ok, seriously, I understand your point, and I also see how this could lead into new complications. Names that go on forever is one, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> would arguably have to be hyphenated for each of the member-state languages. Or you would have to set limits to a two or three name max, which would also be sort of a fuzzy rule. However, just because it hasn't been a solution before, shouldn't mean that we disregard it as a possible solution <u>here and now</u>. It is just my opinion, but I don't like the Italian nor German name to be used only. I don't like the idea of randomly thought-up naming conventions such as choosing the name based on <i>current</i> ethnic majority either. So that would likely lead to the situation where we go with only the Italian names, and this will cause future conflicts, not be neutral, etc., Especially since there are no equivalent English names really. The German <i>looks</i> more like English in many cases, but it is not English. Of course on the other hand, I love the argument Supparluca makes in his first paragraph...&#160;:) If the World could only work that well. take care. Taalo 23:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL, where do you get this my friend. The province is called Bolzano / Bozen. The area/region is Alto Adige/Sudtirol/South Tyrol. Region vs. Province. Province vs. Region. I'm gonna go crazy.&#160;:) Also, even though in theory it may sound good to use the Italian name for Italian majority cities and the German name for German name cities, in practice this is just madness. Some cities like Merano-Meran are nearly 50/50. Are we going to monitor the babies born annually and update the names? Come on now. Also, even though Bolzano is ~75% "Italian", I see no reason not to also list the name Bozen which has it's own cultural significance, and is actually closer to the original Roman name. So please rethink an idea from a practical perspective on how it can be reasonbly implemented. I still say: Bolzano (Bozen) Bolzano-Bozen. It ain't that complex guys. ... and for the love of God, please realize the Province's name is Bolzano in Italian and Bozen in German. Grazie, Danke, ciao,.. cya. Taalo 00:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, the present solution is absolutely unreasonable. There is hardly a place in wikipedia in which such a policy as the one displayed here for naming cities. If there is one thing I've learned by editing in the Balkans, is that you can't make everybody happy, and that the interests of the general community and those of the local editors can be in contrast; and we should use the former, not the latter.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 00:44, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But there is no present solution.&#160;:) Well, I'm proposing a neutral stance, listing both names as they actually do in the province. Bolzano-Bozen, Brennero-Brenner. I mean, this is straight down the middle. If people can't grow up and learn to at least live with that, then neutral admins need to come in. Do you at least see my point that trying to name things all by their ethnic majority is just not practical? Also, I disagree these are even different ethnic people. The people have all been here for centuries, the languages and rulers have revolved around them. anyway, thanks for joining in. Taalo 01:07, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>South Tyrol is incorrect, that is the whole point of this debate. Fair and square, the names should be as the Italian government put forth - remember what Panonian said (a good point at that) - to leave it in only the germanic form would be to discriminate against the Italians in their own country and language. That should be enough in itself to cancel all of this discussion and to end this debate and to correct the format to either "Trentino-Alto Adige" or "Trentino-Sudtirol". If you want to keep the "Trentino-South Tyrol", well, you MUST make concession by allowing the "South Tyrol" change to "Bolzano". Plainly stated, it IS the name of the region. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 00:44, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is a part of Poland that used to be part of Russia before WWII. The town names are in Polish. So we aren't removing the history from the region, nor the cultural diversity of its background. But the region is now in Italy, and there are Italian names set forth. Don't talk about "colonization" or "occupation". The Italian government maintains control (albeit that it is an autonomous region). It wasn't "colonization" - the populace adapted and now mostly speak Italian. Just like the former Poles who are now speaking German (and who are German citizens), and the former Russians who are now speaking Polish (and are Polish citizens). The list could go on and on and on. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 03:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree with the intention of your post, I want to point out that parts of Germany became Polish/Soviet (Russian/Lithuanian) and parts of Poland became Soviet (Lithuanian/Ukrainian/Belarusian), not the other way around.

<dd>That's what I meant (it was late last night, and I was tired - got them mixed around). So yeah - part of Russia (then the Soviet Union, now Ukraine) was part of Poland, and the cities - they are in Russian/Ukrainian. And to call other examples, while talking about the Soviet Union, would be to call out cities in <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakhstan.html" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> (which are in Kazak, not Russian), or cities in <a href="../../../k/y/r/Kyrgyzstan.html" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> (which are in Kyrgyz), or cities in <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> (which are in Azerbaijani]], etc. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 13:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with this. I will definitely look into it even more, but I believe this story that propogates that the "Italians" came in and occupied the region during WW2 is false -- and boils down to politics. It is a lousy way to say some people belong and other do not. From what I've gathered, the people have stayed mostly the same -- and adapted -- as you put it Rarelibra. I'm not trying to ignore the fact that some people were pushed out and other came in during that time. But it wasn't the massive colonization/occupation that one side is trying to portray. Fascism wasn't half as efficient as Nazism (?) -- luckily. Mussolini asked for the Jewish to be thrown out, but if you see the history, for the most part the Italians shrugged and went about their business. If Mussolini asked people to move to Bolzano, some may have, but the vast majority of Italians would typically have it go in one ear, and out the other. People don't even like to move from one village to another 1 mile down the road! Finally, the idea of "German" and "Italian" in this region (and many regions in this area) is more political than real ethnicity. For the most part, the people are of the region, and have been for centuries. Taalo 03:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Gonna bail for a bit. I've spend way too much time this past day and a half on this. I feel like I have talked too much also.&#160;:) I assume this process will be discussed at least for a week or two. I'll check back later.

<li>(copied from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South Tyrol</a>): I'll provide this link I dug up. <a href="http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/1_3kag.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/1_3kag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/1_3kag.htm</a> This does show that there were roughly 73,000 Italians that moved up to Bolzano-Bozen to help build hydroelectric plants. The only thing I can feel happy about this lousy time was that it appears the majority of "Germans" who were going to emigrate, ended up staying afterall. At least this is good to know that no one was cleansed out -- but there does appear to be many new families who moved in. I guess this fits with what I've seen in the churches/cemetaries at least -- that the original people have stuck around. My only point of contention then is that I still disagree with this strict term of "German" or "Italian" -- often based on language. I still believe the people of Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol are <i>a people</i>.. and the "German" or "Italian" is actually a lot due to the rulers who have come and gone. Also, the people are definitely a mix of Roman, Germanic, etc., etc. -- so I really just can't agree that there is a "German" people in Bolzano and an "Italian" people in Trento. All in all, the cultures are almost identical.. and a lot of the dialects (that are actually used more than Italian or German) interweave. Anyway, I hope you all take this history lesson in good faith. I for one learned something more about what happened to my neighbors/cousins over the <i>hill</i>. Regardless, lets try to come up with a neutral position that respects this region and the people -- and indeed the new ones that arrived during those bad days some 70 years ago. That said, my current feeling goes to: cities: Italian-German (this is multiethnic Italy); using the proper Province of Bolzano-Bozen (with a page or section describing South Tyrol/Sudtirol) and maybe we do this page as <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-Alto_Adige_South_Tyrol_f62b.html" title="Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol">Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol</a>? Then we follow what is in the maps of the World (i.e., we do not go against the grain of what is really out there on maps, britannica, etc.), while respecting the Tirolese culture. I don't think this name is too confusing. How do you all think? Ok, now I really got to get work done.. damnit.&#160;:) Taalo 05:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Although the region "Trentino-Alto Adige" was not abolished, its name was changed to "Trentino-South Tyrol" and most of its important powers were taken away and transferred to the two provinces South Tyrol and Trentino." I really hope this author is giving an accurate account. So does this mean both names are in effect? Also, "Until the present, German and Ladin speakers did not distinguish between Italians in South Tyrol and Italians in general. Most of the people did not even distinguish between the Italian people and the Italian government. There is no awareness of the two distinct levels of the conflict. But Italians in South Tyrol can no longer be seen only as the invaders and as tools of the Italianization politics. After living in the province since the 1930s, or at least since the 1950s, they consider South Tyrol to be their homeland too. Their offspring were born there, went to school there and work there. Italians became, over the years, Italian-speaking South Tyroleans." Anyway, that is really a great historical article, if it is accurate. I don't know, I've given credit to the Trentino-South Tyrol folks, without them actually doing any research.&#160;:) I still think though, to be fair with what is on the maps, etc... more and more <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-Alto_Adige_South_Tyrol_f62b.html" title="Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol">Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol</a> makes the most sense. Again, with the cities, we really should use both names. The province, it is hard to argue with what exists.. i.e. the Province of Trento and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen. I like Olessi's idea the best to have a subpage or something describing South Tyrol. Man, for sure I did not like what the Austrians did in the 1800's to the Italians of Trentino... and no more do I like what the Italian Gov't did to the people of Bolzano-Bozen in the 1900's. I hope you all who are from this region can at least realize that many of us have been around here back when we were even all under Rome. I still consider all the <i>people</i> of this region brothers/sisters/cousins. regards. Taalo 06:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand why I should write this, since it seems to me that there are a lot of intelligent people here, and I'm not an <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>.</p>
<p>I think that the problem is that you want to be as neutral as possible, right? How could we be neutral? It's simple, we can just apply the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">naming conventions</a> (not because they are conventions, but because they are good conventions, and they should settle controversies) to all the articles about cities, and also for the Southtyrolean cities.</p>
<p>If we do so, when an Italian will ask "Hey! You chose the German names. So does it mean that you think that the German people are better and that I have to kill myself?" we can reply "Nooo! We just applied the naming conventions, in a logical way!" and he will agree, and will not kill himself; when a German will ask "Hey! You chose the Italian names. So does it mean that Italy is super-power and that I have to kill my family because they aren't true Romans?" we can reply "Nooo! We just applied the naming conventions, in a logical way!" and he will agree, and will not kill his family.</p>
<p>So, step 1: the naming conventions say: "Use the name that English speaking people are more likely to use (even if it is an incorrect name)."</p>
<p>Ok, it's obvious that English speaking people are more likely to use the Italian names for the Southtyrolean cities. But some users don't agree (without any proof, of course).</p>
<p>Step 2: "If there isn't a common English name, use the current local name."</p>
<p>I don't think this step is needed, but if we need that, Ok, we should move all the articles about the Southtyrolean cities to the Italian names.</p>
<p>This is the only way, if you want to be neutral and correct and you want to have consistency whith the rest of the encycolpedia. If you want to make the minorities and/or the majorities happy, well, you can have 100 names per city, and there will be always someone who will complain.--<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupparluca_7508.html" title="User:Supparluca">Supparluca</a> 12:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Brilliant reply Supparluca. At least your first paragraph.&#160;:-) The only problem though is both step 1 and 2 are not easy to figure out really. I know some people really dislike the double names, but my opinion would still be Italian-German, as is on the signs in the region. You don't know how much I agree that either side should relax, that there is no war here for cultural domination, etc. I fear that not everyone can quite feel confortable with that yet..

<dd>Calling it 'Bolzano-Bozen' helps people get along on this page, but works <i>against</i> that globally. As <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupparluca_7508.html" title="User:Supparluca">Supparluca</a> says, having a convention and sticking to it limits offence - a German reader might be disappointed not to see 'Bozen', but will understand that it's not an anti-German step, just a convention. He can go look at other pages and see the same convention followed there, when it favours German names and when it doesn't. If we break that convention here, it undermines it elsewhere - if <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timbuktu.html" title="Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a> has half a dozen ethnic groups each with their own name for the place, each and every one of them can look at <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano-Bozen_e09f.html" title="Bolzano-Bozen">Bolzano-Bozen</a> and argue that they should get the same treatment. And then we end up with a page called Timbuktu-Wagga Wagga-Back Of Burke-Albuquerque-Outer Woop Woop-Evenmore and start arguing about what order those names should be listed in... I think it's better to follow the convention than to look for complete coverage in the title. The place for inclusiveness and completeness is in the body of the article, IMHO. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok then. You know what, maybe it is the best way to go afterall -- nice argument. The one thing though, is I feel human nature makes it hard for people to simply see the convention as used and leave it at that. Why? Because just as they would like to see the German name used instead of the the Italian name (just making an example guys!), some will just then simply want to try and have the <i>convention</i> itself changed. Maybe that is partly what has been going on here, consciously or subconsciously. Regardless, this is an issue individuals have to work out themselves I guess. As for me, if we do go to just <b>Bolzano</b>, <b>Brennero</b>, etc., etc., next time I visit the region I'm going to start taking photos of all the city signs on the roads and post them on the page. In that way at least I'll see both names, Bolzano-Bozen, Brennero-Brenner somewhere. That will be enough to make me happy, and remember the Roman/Italian-Germanic/Austrian history of the region.&#160;:-) Taalo 02:21, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would still prefer going with Bolzano-Bozen or Bolzano (Bozen), but if people are so against using double names -- so be it. I don't know what the hard rules are in Wikipedia, so I will defer to those more knowledgeable. I will still assume that the rule above all is to be correct, fair, and neutral. I would like to make one suggestion though. I would very much like to see that first paragraph of <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupparluca_7508.html" title="User:Supparluca">user:Supparluca</a>'s comment permantly quoted at the top of every town, province and regional page that are connected with this province.

<p>I'll try to start the proper discussion process. User PhJ, we use consensus on Wikipedia, and neither of us actually have it at this point. My proposal is simple for the naming order: Italian-Ladin-German. Italian first, because the pages describe objects in Italy; this is basic convention on Wikipedia. I know PhJ wanted German first on some of the Bolzano-Bozen pages, it is very nice of him to have given up on that one. Putting Ladin second was my idea to just give some respect to what is actually the most native language of this region. I thought maybe German could go last (but not least) since well.. I think German has a lot more stuff out there than the small Ladin world. I guess for some, having German last is just proving too much to take. Anyway, that was just my idea and my opinion.

<dd>Just a word to Taalo: Choosing the order it-de-ladin for Meran was an offer for a compromise to avoid edit warring, but you were holding on. In fact my present proposal reflects best the practice on using South Tyrolean article names approved by Wikipedia. This should also be practised for the order of names where English names are used. --<a href="../../../p/h/j/User%7EPhJ_8c2f.html" title="User:PhJ">PhJ</a> 08:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just a word to PhJ. It takes a minimum of <u>two</u> to <i>hold on</i> and have an edit war. As far as a simple proposal, a simpler proposal would be to use one convention across all pages. IT-DE-LA or IT-LA-DE would be fine. It is typical for the country the location exists in be listed first. To be blunt, isn't there something more interesting out there than trying to push DE higher and higher? Taalo 16:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we need more opinions now. There have been three clear proposals so far:
<ol>
<li>order depending on number of speakers: EN - it-de-ladin OR EN - de-it-ladin</li>
<li>EN - it-de-ladin</li>
<li>EN - it-ladin-de</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>As you see, Taalo, there has been no proposal "de-it-ladin generally". So you are obvious wrong saying "PhJ wants to push DE higher and higher".</dd>

<dd>Hmm. Well, a lot of this came about when I saw you do this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merano&amp;diff=113672926&amp;oldid=113033738" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merano&amp;diff=113672926&amp;oldid=113033738" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merano.html" title="Merano">Merano</a> on 8 March 2007.

<dd>I did that because of this: <i>According to the 2001 census, 51.50 % of the Meranese population speaks German as a first language, 48.01% Italian, and 0.49% Ladin.</i> <a href="../../../p/h/j/User%7EPhJ_8c2f.html" title="User:PhJ">PhJ</a> 19:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless, what you did was done unilaterally and simply based on your particular POV. Is it <i>vandalism</i> then? In reality most people in Italy speak their local languages; would you like to go through Wikipedia and please fix this for every page then? Look, on en.wikipedia it is common to list the home country's national language first. By moving "German" to the front it simply appears dubious, maybe also easily misconstrued given your ethnic background. I noticed recently you like to go on pages and delete the Standard Italian naming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sepp_Kerschbaumer&amp;diff=114555032&amp;oldid=111595040" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sepp_Kerschbaumer&amp;diff=114555032&amp;oldid=111595040" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>Meran is not a ladin name even if the ladins use also Meran Meran cut be latin but was created after the roman time</dd>

<dd>So Meran is a Germanic word in your <i>opinion</i>? As far as I know there was Latin proper that came from the Roman times. In this region of the Alps "a conservative branch of the Romance (i.e. Latin) family" popped up. I'd make a wager that this is where these local words come from originally. We also use Meran in Nones/Solardo, the languages you <i>think</i> are dialects, but are in fact variations of Rhaeto-Romance, the Italian language of our area. Anyway, I'd say that <u>both</u> Bolsan/Bulsan and Bozen sound pretty darn similar to Bauzanum. Go figure.&#160;:) ps. and maybe we are getting a bit off subject, but then again, you don't like to discuss Italy/Italian stuff on your talk page.&#160;:P Taalo 20:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just see a lot of it as being very fuzzy. In the Val di Non I know some people who speak in Standard Italian and then some in Nones, and it flips back and forth. That is why I have said before that things are not so cut and dry: the "Italians" and the "Germans". In reality there are basically people from this spot on Earth. The languages do not really identify ethnicity. Almost, my opinion is that languages like Ladin and Nones are Italian languages (and due to their location with particular influences of other languages). Martin, you will likely disagree. That is fine, it is just my opinion. I just know that Nones feels <u>much</u> more related to Standard Italian than German. Taalo 18:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bozen and variant are of latin origin maybe Meran too, but Meran is not a ladin word, because the language wasn't spoken there in this Time--<a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmes_a600.html" title="User:Emes">Martin Se</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Ladin came after Latin, of course. My only point is that languages such as Ladin in this region very predate both German (very likely) and Standard Italian (definitely). Regardless, I consider Ladin, Nones, Sicilian, etc. all languages of Italy, just as Cantonese, Mandarin, Hakka are all languages of China. It is my POV. end of story.&#160;:} Taalo 17:34, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Rarelibra: you win&#160;:D. But seriously my point is, be the roots what they may, languages work and expand like that, from preesisting things; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Influencegraph.PNG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Influencegraph.PNG" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if the origin of a word determines its "legitimate ownership", the English language sure outsourced a lot! On the usage of Italian dialects in South Tyrol, Martin is 90+% right: you can hear Tridentine in the <a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cberetsch-Unterland_ce7c.html" title="Überetsch-Unterland">Überetsch-Unterland</a>, where the "historical" Italian minority resides. Elsewhere Mussolini sent colonists from the most varied areas of Italy, thus making standard Italian, well, the standard. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 19:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My only point also is that it isn't so black-and-white when someone might say that <i>Meran</i> is not an Italian word. Just because it isn't the Standard Italian word, which has the vowel at the end, doesn't mean it is not an Italian word. That said, I'm not trying to claim a word under the flag of Italy, or any such thing. It is fine if someone wants to say/argue it is a German word, but then also try and consider that it is <i>also</i> an Italian word. We use it in Nones, which is a language of Italy. We are from Trentino, but we are also part of the overall people of Italy. I personally dislike the separatist/isolationist attitude that "we are X, and not Italian". It is boring to me, because everyone on the whole darn peninsula could say this if they so feel inclined. But whatever, everyone can thing as they want. Taalo 19:51, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and my point is that England was founded by hordes of invading Germanic tribes that migrated across Europe - look at the proto-Celtic population, for example, with their origin being as far as the shores of the Black Sea. England - or "Ang-land" (as in Anglo-Saxons) had it's language root in the Germanic (or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Germanic_47a8.html" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a>) family - <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germanic_languages_8c80.html" title="West Germanic languages">West Germanic</a> branch, to be more precise (and I don't mean the <i>original</i> or <i>native</i> population of the islands). So by sheer logic, we speak a descended form of Germanic - thus, "England" is a Germanic word.

<dd>I believe some genetic research recently suggested that most English are of Germanic stock actually, so it is more than just the language which is a descendent. It seems the local English, from way back when, were somehow made extinct (well, probably melted in, who knows). Anyway, I obviously didn't get it into in much detail, and my POV is that a lot of this genetic research is still pretty coarse. You just have to read about recent theories on Thomas Jefferson to figure that out. Anyway, I believe regardless -- we all still end up being shown to be human. Man, we are going off the subject.

<dd>Lol, my intent was simply to attempt a demostratio quia absurdum - I meant no harm. Rarelibra, I merely thought there was no other root for London other than the Roman "Londinium", I guess you just owned me. On English genetics, last week I read on the newspaper about a research claiming that Englishman and Irishman had virtually no genetic differences; could it be that Germanic tribes overtook the green island but conceded their language? Conversely, an anthropologist I once met told me that the object of his obsession was that the human type visible in Etruscan paintings was/is almost nowhere to be seen today in central Italy, rare as albino gorillas. What's the latest development on Jefferson? I have a weak spot for him, just because his buildings are the most exquisite examples of Neoclassicism I can think of. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 05:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Markussep - this is not quite a clear-cut case. When you go to the website of the city, it offers a version in Italian (Bolzano) and German (Bozen). When you go to the official tourism website and click on the "Welcome" for English, it gives you "Bolzano-Bozen"... even their email address is to "bolzano-bozen.it". I am all in favor of the dual-naming because of the sensitivity of the region and the proof of existence with the official governments. But to alleviate the need by many, I have already sent out emails to the governmental entities (region, province, and city) to ask about the proper reference to the cities within the province/region. Stay tuned. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 15:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="http://www.bolzano-bozen.it/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bolzano-bozen.it/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (the official tourism site) uses a double name because it's intended for German, Italian and English speakers. I checked several of the English pages, and saw that they use Bolzano in the text (and the page header and menus), not Bolzano-Bozen. The only instances where I see the double name is in the logo and the address. As expected, the German pages use only Bozen (except the logo), and the Italian pages only Bolzano (again except the logo). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 17:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I sincerely doubt you will find established use of dual names in texts that are primarily meant for English speakers, and written by English speakers. I'm sure you can demonstrate (limited) dual-names usage for Bolzano-Bozen, Vienna-Wien, Rome-Roma, Leeuwarden-Ljouwert or Fiume-Rijeka, but that doesn't mean that it's the most commonly used name in English. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 18:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me get this straight: the Gryffindor position is that every municipality in Alto Adige/South Tyrol (hey, if the regional name is a guideline for communes also, it must be for the province as well) should now have a double name? Adding those alternate names will be long: lots of communes, in AA/ST.<br />
I just can't see what was wrong with the old convention, which, in the lack of clear-cut English names, chose the language of the majority of speakers for every commune - although, as I said several times, how Meran became Merano just escapes my comprehension. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 18:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're kidding me, right? Merano is the name given by the Italian government. So you are arguing against the Italian usage? Anyway, it is not the "Gryffindor" position, it is a position held by several others (including myself). Stop singling out one editor.

<dd>Meran is also a name given by the government. The article title is Merano because of a survey (the main argument was that the Italian name is significantly more used in English than the German name). Italian usage is not very relevant, en.wikipedia describes English usage. This region is not more complex than for instance Quebec, Belgium, Switzerland, or western Finland, to name but a few bi-, tri- and quadrilingual countries and regions. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 20:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Neither was South Tyrol, that was WWI. My point is that in other regions with potential or actual linguistic struggles (Belgium!) no need was felt for Bolzano-Bozen type solutions.

<dd>I'm against the Italian usage <i>for the English Wiki</i>. First because there's a German majority there, second because since 1924 there's been a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF1E3FF93AA15752C0A9609C8B63&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FC%2FChess" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF1E3FF93AA15752C0A9609C8B63&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FC%2FChess" rel="nofollow">steady flow of English books and articles</a> (there's a NYT example) calling Merano Meran, albeit not for a mass audience perhaps. And yes, Deo piacente I'm not that blinded by patrioticism to always take the side of Italian, whatever the case.<br /></dd>
<dd>I'm sorry if I seemed to single out Gryffindor; it was just that it was him who made the moves in the first place. I think I just... followed the legal practice of calling a motion after its presenter&#160;:). As for the complexity, I thought I did: the above mentioned case of Merano should, if I dare say so myself, shows how unhappy I am with taking advantage of the belonging of South Tyrol to Italy to merely write off the German presence. There was a vote, and I didn't move the page just because I find it flat-out groundless. Back to the point: the example of Quebec, Belgium and Switzerland all point to the fact that, in Wikipedia, articles on cities in multilingual areas are named following the language most spoken there (barring cities with an established English name). So, <i>if</i> we accept this, why adopt a special policy here? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 22:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Well here I am and I can explain. Since we established finally by consensus to name the region with a double-name "Trentino Alto-Adige/Südtirol", I thought it only fair to name the capital city with a double-name as well as opposed to only one, the Italian version. I would support also to revert all the village and city names of South Tyrol back to their double-language names, which is how it was originally. These place names were moved although there was substantial opposition to such a move. There are various options: 1) either use double-names or 2) use the language of the majority-spoken population. I would support the double-names as a fair compromise (since issues pertaining to this region need to be apparently compromised upon), or use the names of the majority. In that case I could understand a simple "Bolzano", but then why is it "Merano" if the majority is German-speaking? So even if my moves seemed unilateral, I am seeking a neutral compromise, which is in line with Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 20:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to back up Gryffindor on this one. If the agreed upon policy was to use the name that was most common with the majority lingual speaking population, then it should fit that, with evidence, the proper names be assigned. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 00:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you might remember from the "Communes of South Tyrol" survey, there was a more substantial opposition to double names. Let's not go back there. The rules we agreed on are: take the most commonly used name in English (which is a naming convention, BTW), and if that's not clear (e.g. very limited occurrence in English), use the local majority language. Meran(o) is an arguable case, with nearly equal German- and Italian-speaking population. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 07:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The applicable policy, <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>, says to use the most common name <i>in English</i> if there is one; the problem with most of the region's communes is that there isn't one (so we came up with the majority-language, as a stopgap). I acknowledge that Rarelibra opposes this policy; but this is not the page to do it on. <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, however, is both common English usage, <b>and</b> the language of the linguistic majority. There is evidence that Merano is preferred in English, and the linguistic majority is feather thin; I forget whether 51 or 53%. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 22:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed - and, conversely, Merano should be moved to Meran - the German majority may be slim, but that's how it works.

<p>Thank you Rarelibra for your support and understanding. Again, I mean no harm and in no way do I want to be seen as "abusing" anything. My understanding is that since we agreed to use a double-name for the region (in this case Italian and German) as the most neutral solution, what is the problem in reverting to double-names for the cities and villages of that region? The articles were originally in that format. I think that is only a fair compromise and is fully in line with Wikipedia policy on being as "neutral" as possible. I know that many users took great offence when the cities were moved to single names (in either language), and the official name of the capital city of South Tyrol is a double-name anyway. So moving it to that format only reflects a fact, not an act of vandalism as some apparently want to construe. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 17:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree in principle, but I still believe common English usage should overrule. For example, Merano is probably the more used word in English. Ortisei is the name that is more commonly used as well. Even the <u>local people</u> will use this name for tourists, marketing, etc. It is the same word afterall!

<dd>Ok, lets be very clear here. Keeping things "professional" is accomplished first and foremost by not having these particular <u>actions</u> in the first place. Someone does not go and move pages unilaterally. Someone does not go and blank ongoing straw polls/discussions. This behavior is obviously not only annoying to me -- given the discussions I read above. I do not agree with this approach of going after the people who come forward and call out this behavior. I'm sorry if my adjective looks harsh (and I'll tell you that I'm being very polite already), but after all a word really pales in comparison to actions.

I would wholeheartedly enjoy having things discussed in a calm, rational way. You especially should know that I've wanted solutions which are for compromise and sharing from the beginning. I admit I was rather shocked when I saw the discussions on the TN page blanked today; and saying <i>shady</i> was being pretty darned polite already.&#160;:-) Ok, I can go to an Admin next time or do an RfC, though you know what?

<p>First of all <a href="../../../i/c/s/User%7EIcsunonove_23ad.html" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> aka Taalo I didn't "nuke" any discussions but simply archived them because of your habit to constantly sprout up "straw polls" all over the place that in the end no one knows anymore what and where to vote for. In order to bring some oversight I decided to archive that poll. Your move to erase a running official poll is a bad idea, I restored it + the previous straw poll since you insist. I hope that satisfies your demands.</p>
<p>Now about the names of the cities, I still would prefer double-names (yes, that means adding the Italian names to cities and villages which have a German-speaking majority). Since I thought we finally were able to agree to use the official name for the region of "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol", I think we should restore the articles to their original double names. However if there is little accomodation for that, I will have to agree in that case to use names of the majority-speak. It should be "Bolzano" then and "Meran", in order to be consistent. Again, I still would prefer double-names in order to be fair to every side. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 21:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You were virtually alone in that. It is not fair to the anglophone reader, who is consistently misinformed.

<dd>Here we go again, Gryffindor... with Pmanderson (the real name) making the big word "anglophone" statements (unnecessary!). If you would just <i>read</i> his statement, Pmanderson, you would realize that he said he thinks the articles should be restored, <b>BUT</b>, he agrees in the case of using the names of majority-speaking community (which is what we decided on to use - thus, Merano should be moved to Meran, etc). So it seems a happy outcome for all here... now, after all the names are settled, let's all take a break, protect the pages, and enjoy a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forst.html" title="Forst">Forst</a>, for God's sake. OH, and BTW, the only ones misinforming the reader are the ones like yourself who insist upon undue names like "Tenedos" for what is really "Bozcaada".&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 12:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL. First of all <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> aka <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a>, etc., etc., do not try to cover up your behavior by pointing the finger at me with this absurd <i>"constantly sprout up "straw polls" all over the place"</i>. I am not the only one that put up straw polls, and I'd much rather take the criticism of putting up too many polls before doing what you do. But, hmm, I suppose that is why you are attempting to turn the target from you to me? ^_- Fine, do whatever you want. We are trying to have a thorough discussion, which may take more time in the end, but leads to solutions where the majority of people can truly feel satisfied, just like at <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-Alto_Adige_S%C3%BCdtirol_20b3.html" title="Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol">Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol</a>. I completely agree with <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> as well, the English reader is constantly being misinformed in these naming conventions. I should have some inkling about that too, considering I am a native English speaker with roots in the region. Anyway, if I understand the previous discussions it was: 1) English usage first 2) majority-language second. The latter bit being debatable in itself, but at least reasonable. So that says, <i>Merano</i>, as <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> pointed out yet again. <a href="../../../i/c/s/User%7EIcsunonove_23ad.html" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> 23:00, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could support the solution "English <i>name</i> (if there is considerable <i>usage</i> of the name) first, majority-language second", but that does definitely NOT say "Merano" but the following, as the only place in <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-Alto_Adige_S%C3%BCdtirol_20b3.html" title="Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol">Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol</a> with an English name is <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent.html" title="Trent">Trent</a>: <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolzano.html" title="Bolzano">Bolzano</a> (it), <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meran.html" title="Meran">Meran</a> (de), <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brixen.html" title="Brixen">Brixen</a> (de), <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laives.html" title="Laives">Laives</a> (it), <a href="../../../u/r/t/Urtij%C3%ABi.html" title="Urtijëi">Urtijëi</a> (ladin), <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent.html" title="Trent">Trent</a> (en). On the other hand, we have come to a compromise on the region <i>abandoning</i> the English name <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South Tyrol</a> so it would be a bit inconsistent. Therefore my first choice is, as I wrote above, "Majority language as article name", my second choice, "Double names", and my third choice, "English name first, majority-language second". I am for the inclusion of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino.html" title="Trentino">Trentino</a> into the naming convention (which is relevant for a handfull of place names): e.g. <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vich_de_Fascia_0d54.html" title="Vich de Fascia">Vich de Fascia</a> (ladin) for <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigo_di_Fassa_6943.html" title="Vigo di Fassa">Vigo di Fassa</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gereut.html" title="Gereut">Gereut</a> (de) or <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garait.html" title="Garait">Garait</a> for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frassilongo.html" title="Frassilongo">Frassilongo</a> --<a href="../../../p/h/j/User%7EPhJ_8c2f.html" title="User:PhJ">PhJ</a> 08:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And where are you going to find official statistics on commune per commune linguistic usage in Trentino? I can agree to have Lusèrn, or Gareit although that one specifically is <a href="http://www.kib.it/pag_cms/articolo.asp?IDcms=477" class="external text" title="http://www.kib.it/pag_cms/articolo.asp?IDcms=477" rel="nofollow">highly dubious</a>, but let's not forget that readers of Wikipedia would vainly look for them on a road sign should they visit. We can have exceptions, but too many of them simply cross the line between <i>reporting</i>, that's what encyclopaedias do, and <i>taking a stance</i>, which would be to make official something that is yet not. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 12:13, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In the communes of the mòchena part of Fersina valley those who declare to know and use Mòcheno oscillate between 82,7 and 78,8%, depending on the village. Finally Ladins, the largest group: 81,3% affirmed in the Censiment to know Ladin, and 79,5% to use it. ... regardin children between age 0-10, in Fassa valley Ladin is known by 88,2% and spoken by 77,9% of the resident children".

<dd>Right, you are missing the point. I'm saying the consensus that was found previously was for 1) common English, then 2) local language. I would argue that especially for major cities (major cities, tourist destinations, etc.) like Merano, Ortisei, etc. -- that these names are Common English usage. You really confuse the reader by using Urtijëi, for example. I can back using names that the language majority use, but common English usage should overrule. <a href="../../../i/c/s/User%7EIcsunonove_23ad.html" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> 17:50, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I was under the impression that the consensus was for 1) Common English usage then 2) local language-majority name. Number two makes sense to me for a lot of these little villages and towns. However, for major cities like Merano and Bressanone, or famous tourist towns like Ortisei, does it really make sense to go with these "majority-language" names? I would argue that even the local people in Ortisei will use this spelling when they describe their town (especially in brochures, tourist guides, etc.). I respect the idea of using the local languages, but I think we have to remember to weight this together with a respect for the national language of the country, the guidelines on using what is common English usage, along with a little dose of reality.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../i/c/s/User%7EIcsunonove_23ad.html" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> 21:48, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
