<p>I noticed you nominated The Simpsons recently for featured status, but you had forgoten to archive the old nomination, and begin a new one.</p>
<p>According to "Nomination procedure" to archive anyone can follow this steps:</p>
<p>If the article you are submitting has had a previous FAC nomination, use the Move button to archive the previous FAC discussion. For example, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Television_c79e.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Television">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Television</a> → Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Television/archive1. Remember to change the old <code>{{facfailed}}</code> template on the talk page to <code>{{facfailed|Television/archive1}}</code>.</p>
<p>This steps are featured on the page <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_c58c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates</a> and are a general guideline for all wikipedians. So can I ask you kindly to archive the old nomination and start a new one? <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 21:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Qwghlm only made a suggestion, and not mandatory nor to you. As I have stated, many pages that have reached featured article status contain trivia sections. Also the information on marching on together which I updated, and you keep on reverting, is infact correct. Leeds! Leeds! Leeds! (Marching On Together) was the B-side to "Leeds United" as the information on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marching_On_Together_f58c.html" title="Marching On Together">Marching On Together</a> states and this is taken from many leeds fan sites available on the internet if you wish to find it. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChappy84_f29e.html" title="User:Chappy84">Chappy84</a> 20:36, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> confirmed this with you? You are correct about the snong title. But would it not be better to Wikify it than to stick a main article link in the middle of a section. And as said before a triva section seems very uncyclopedia. If you'd like to keep the fact in the aricle you could sick them into an existing section. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBole2_5cd8.html" title="User:Bole2">Bole2</a> 20:41, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the song, the link to main article is there so people can find out more information on the song.

<dd>I've dropped a note on Chappy84's page and also done some more PR work on the LUAFC article. The article's been improved a fair bit, but it still needs some citations. However the biggest obstacle to GA right now is the quality of the prose - as well as the odd spelling error a lot of it just doesn't flow very well, in my opinion - too many filler words and repetitions. Tighten that, get it more into <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a>, and you'll have a much better article. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 22:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Some good work with the FA. I think the part about copyrighting the crest may have to go.

<p>I did really get what you ment on your objection so can you please let me know. What did you mean by "Tournament and Media coverage sections need exspanding." like in - expand it with what other info were you looking for? because the tournament explains it as much as anyone can, i think. also "The "Performance of teams" section looks a bit odd stuck between two tables." can you please point out whats wrong with it so we can fix it. and please do point out original research too. thank you again for helping--<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThugchildz_4a0d.html" title="User:Thugchildz">Thugchildz</a></p>

<p>Why did you undo all the edits I made to the Monaco winners table? The background is pink, so why not say pink instead of "dark"? And you have reinstated all the incorrectly sized flags as well. In particular, what is wron with multiple links? You are making the assumption that someone would be reading the table from top to bottom instead of just trying to find a single winner entry. Multiple links is far easier to use, looks better, and is in line with convention used in the vast majority of other grand prix and formula one articles. So why do it? <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrope_6763.html" title="User:Pyrope">Pyrope</a> 17:47, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My question to you was "why are multiple links in a table wrong"? You haven't answered this yet. From what I can see, multiple links are by far and away the preferrable option because:
<ol>
<li>They allow easier navigation if you are using the table to find a specific year's winner.</li>
<li>They follow the convention used in the majority of other F1/GP tables.</li>
<li>They are far easier on the eye.</li>
</ol>

<dd>A guideline is not a reason. For a start it's only a guide, and secondly a guideline is the result of reasoning, not a reason in itself. In any case, as I understand the links guides they relate to the use of wikilinks in blocks of discursive text, not in tabulated data. I fully support the reasoning in text situations, as most text is read in a linear fasion, from start to finish. In these cases, all you need to link is the first instance of a noun, and any more clutters the text making it hard to read. Tables are very rarely "read" at all, and are certainly not used in the same way as a block of text, so having a noun linked wherever it occurs makes sense. I have given you my reasons why I think that multiple links in tables are a good idea. So, why do you think otherwise? <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrope_6763.html" title="User:Pyrope">Pyrope</a> 20:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You remember right, but as I mentioned above, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Wikilinking" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">guide</a> is talking about text, not tables.

<dd>Please do not keep reverting Colly's article to have a solid thick black line separating the overalls from the individual rows, it looks awful. The light grey separation is much more appealing, and is useful to show the difference between the rows and the totals.

<dd>Hello, I've added some information to address your concerns on the nom page for Ipswich Town. I believe both Dweller's and my explanation should hopefully meet your minor oppose and would ask you to re-consider. After all, the article's FA nom is based on that of <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a>, a well-established featured article, and in the lead there are no citations and information that is expanded upon within the main body of the text, just like the Ipswich page.
