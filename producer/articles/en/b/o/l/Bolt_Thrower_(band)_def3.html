<p>Bolt Thrower were formed in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_in_music.html" title="1986 in music">1986</a> as a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a> band, influenced largely by thrash bands such as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slayer.html" title="Slayer">Slayer</a> and hardcore punk bands like <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crass.html" title="Crass">Crass</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discharge_%28band%29.html" title="Discharge (band)">Discharge</a><sup id="_ref-Bolt_Thrower_Official_Biography_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bolt_Thrower_Official_Biography" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The band was founded by bassist <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavin_Ward_%28musician%29_58d8.html" title="Gavin Ward (musician)">Gavin Ward</a> and guitarist <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Thompson_0faa.html" title="Barry Thompson">Barry Thompson</a> in a <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a> <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">pub</a> toilet during a hardcore punk <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">gig</a>. Shortly thereafter <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Whale_f803.html" title="Andrew Whale">Andrew Whale</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_West_%28musician%29_b3c8.html" title="Alan West (musician)">Alan West</a> joined on drums and vocals respectively. In April <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_music.html" title="1987 in music">1987</a> the <i>In Battle There Is No Law</i> demo was recorded with this line-up.</p>
<p>Their second recording was the <i>Concession of Pain</i> demo, which they made in September of 1987. Gavin had switched to guitars and they recruited Alex Tweedy to play the bass. However, Alex did not show up for the recording, and so Gavin played both guitar and bass for the demo. Two weeks after the recording session, Gavin's girlfriend <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Bench_bc6f.html" title="Jo Bench">Jo Bench</a> replaced Tweedy.</p>
<p>With this line-up they recorded their first Peel session on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_music.html" title="1988 in music">1988</a>, with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a>, the alternative disk jockey of <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_One_22f7.html" title="BBC Radio One">BBC Radio One</a><sup id="_ref-Overview_of_Peel_sessions_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Overview_of_Peel_sessions" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He had received their second demo and became enthusiastic about the band. They recorded four tracks for it, resulting in a deal with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_Solution_3764.html" title="Vinyl Solution">Vinyl Solution</a> to release one album. Just before the recording of their first full-length album, they replaced their singer with their driver <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Willetts_1d62.html" title="Karl Willetts">Karl Willetts</a>. Their debut <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_record.html" title="Vinyl record">LP</a>, <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Battle_there_is_no_Law_bb6f.html" title="In Battle there is no Law">In Battle there is no Law</a></i> is only a half hour in length and has a primitive and raw sound.</p>

<p>They were not satisfied with the deal with Vinyl Solution as it was a pure <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a> label at that time. The label did little promotion for Bolt Thrower and their blend of death metal and hardcore punk, so after one album Bolt Thrower decided to leave Vinyl Solution and were signed by <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earache_Records_2af4.html" title="Earache Records">Earache Records</a>. Earache Records had also signed many other death metal bands including <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcass_%28band%29.html" title="Carcass (band)">Carcass</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napalm_Death_8a12.html" title="Napalm Death">Napalm Death</a>. The band worked a little on their style and changed to playing faster, more aggressive and powerful songs, becoming more of a <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a>, death metal band. The production of this album was not great, though it was an improvement on previous attempts. The artwork was done by <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> (they produce games such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer.html" title="Warhammer">Warhammer</a>) as a gaming supplement they produced had a similar name to the album Bolt Thrower was about to release. After Games Workshop heard the recording of the songs for Bolt Thrower's second Peel session, which was recorded on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a><sup id="_ref-Overview_of_Peel_sessions_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Overview_of_Peel_sessions" title="">[2]</a></sup>, they offered to do the expensive artwork for Bolt Thrower's album. The band accepted this offer. The record was released in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> with the title of <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Realm_of_Chaos_1776.html" title="Realm of Chaos">Realm of Chaos</a></i> and with the subtitle <i>Slaves To Darkness</i>. Most of the lyrics to the songs were also influenced by the game, but not merely because of the deal with Games Workshop. Karl, Andy and Gavin were very much into the games Games Workshop produced and they wrote a couple of songs about these games. Some obvious examples are "<a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurgle.html" title="Nurgle">Plague Bearer</a>" and "<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Eaters_3268.html" title="World Eaters">World Eater</a>". Most lyrics can however be projected on war, the general theme Bolt Thrower uses. After the recording of <i>Realm of Chaos</i> they went on the Grindcrusher Tour with label mates <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napalm_Death_8a12.html" title="Napalm Death">Napalm Death</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcass_%28band%29.html" title="Carcass (band)">Carcass</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morbid_Angel_2b82.html" title="Morbid Angel">Morbid Angel</a>. On the <i>Cenotaph</i> EP one song ("Realm of Chaos") appears that is recorded during this tour. This EP also features the two CD-bonus tracks from <i>War Master</i> and <i>Realm of Chaos</i> plus the song "Cenotaph".</p>
<p>Continuing, they recorded their third and final Peel session on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">22 July</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_music.html" title="1990 in music">1990</a><sup id="_ref-Overview_of_Peel_sessions_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Overview_of_Peel_sessions" title="">[2]</a></sup>. On this three songs from the upcoming album were performed in raw versions as well as "Lost Souls Domain" off <i>Realm Of Chaos</i>. Next step in the history of Bolt Thrower was the album titled <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Master_76e5.html" title="War Master">War Master</a></i>. This album is very ingenious, they took out the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a> influences becoming more <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> band. They put in some more skills in playing and making it all sound far more sophisticated. And this time the production was done skilfully. It was recorded, as the previous album in the Slaughterhouse studios, which burnt down two weeks after the recordings were completed. Again Games Workshop offered them to do the artwork; however as it was considered too expensive, Bolt Thrower declined the offer. The former head-designer of Games Workshop would do the artwork, resulting in quite similar artwork as that on <i>Realm of Chaos</i>. For the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> tour they did to promote the <i>War Master</i> album, they used an old US school bus as tour bus, loaded with many computer games. All three Peel Sessions were then released on one CD named <i>The Peel Sessions 1988-90</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_music.html" title="1991 in music">1991</a>.</p>
<p>Their next step was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_IVth_Crusade_8f34.html" title="The IVth Crusade">The IVth Crusade</a></i>. The title has a double meaning, as it was their fourth studio album (not counting the Peel sessions), but the album title also refers to the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Crusade_1f82.html" title="Fourth Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> and the capturing of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. The cover artwork is a painting from <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_4886.html" title="Eugène Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>, showing "The Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople".</p>
<p>They <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtune.html" title="Downtune">downtuned</a> their guitars even more and wrote slower songs which were heavier and more bombastic. It tends more to <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom_metal.html" title="Doom metal">doom metal</a> influenced by bands like <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candlemass.html" title="Candlemass">Candlemass</a>, in combination with their own massive death metal sound. The album was followed by the tour <i>World Crusade</i> with the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> death metal act <a href="../../../v/a/d/Vader_%28band%29.html" title="Vader (band)">Vader</a> and the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> death metal band <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_%28band%29.html" title="Grave (band)">Grave</a> in Europe. The band toured the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> again as well as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. During this time a single was released called <i>Spearhead</i> containing a very heavy, extended remix of the CD track "Spearhead" plus two new tracks and "Dying Creed" off the album.</p>

Both left the band because of changing life directions<sup id="_ref-BOLT_THROWER_Working_On_New_Material_-_Feb._12.2C_2007_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BOLT_THROWER_Working_On_New_Material_-_Feb._12.2C_2007" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The latest American tour did not go well, they returned home prematurely and by this time the band was quite fed-up with touring. They too made a partial return to their <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">Hardcore</a>/<a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a> roots, whilst not forgetting their doom influences, though the vocals tended to sound a bit different: less <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_grunt.html" title="Death grunt">growling</a>, but more hardcore punk styled; they were somewhat more like hoarse screaming, especially on "When Glory Beckons" and "Armageddon Bound". A limited edition of the album exists containing a bonus Live CD, called <i>War</i> (sometimes called "Live War"). After the album release Karl Willetts was replaced by <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutchman</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_van_Drunen_9252.html" title="Martin van Drunen">Martin van Drunen</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Kearns_eafd.html" title="Martin Kearns">Martin Kearns</a>, who took over the drum kit.</p>

Bolt Thrower in 2001</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_music.html" title="1995 in music">1995</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_music.html" title="1996 in music">1996</a> the band did two European tours<sup id="_ref-Tours_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tours" title="">[4]</a></sup>. Then in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_music.html" title="1997 in music">1997</a>, Martin van Drunen decided to leave the band again as he had never felt he really became a part of Bolt Thrower, and also because he got a disease that made his hair fall out due to which he felt insecure on stage<sup id="_ref-Martin_van_Drunen_Interview_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Martin_van_Drunen_Interview" title="">[5]</a></sup>. For at least one show in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> long time friend <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Ingram_c154.html" title="Dave Ingram">Dave Ingram</a> stood in. Martin Kearns decided to leave again. The position at the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_kit.html" title="Drum kit">drum kit</a> is now taken by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Thomas_d6a8.html" title="Alex Thomas">Alex Thomas</a>. Karl Willetts temporarily rejoined the band to do the vocal duties on the next album. The band switched record labels from <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earache_Records_2af4.html" title="Earache Records">Earache</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Blade_Records_0edb.html" title="Metal Blade Records">Metal Blade Records</a>, because since the US <i>...For Victory</i> tour they had seen a lack of success with Earache. Earache had also wanted to get rid of them and Bolt Thrower wanted to leave Earache as soon as possible, so they parted company.</p>
<p>The album titled <i><a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary_%28album%29.html" title="Mercenary (album)">Mercenary</a></i> was released on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">8 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_music.html" title="1998 in music">1998</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">10 November</a> 1998 in the USA, and features 9 tracks. It is over all a bit slower than its predecessors. However, it is definitely very heavy and sounds very much Bolt Thrower. And Karl returned to perform his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band have recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benediction_%28band%29.html" title="Benediction (band)">Benediction</a>.</p>
<p>In November 1998, Earache Records released <i>Who Dares Wins</i>, an album featuring various older recordings, including the songs from the Spearhead EP and Cenotaph EP. The band themselves do not agree with the release this album, as it is a cheap cash-in from Earache and they warn not to buy it. Originally, it was titled <i>No Guts - No Glory</i> but the title was changed because one song on <i>Mercenary</i> has the same title and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Blade_Records_0edb.html" title="Metal Blade Records">Metal Blade</a> objected. Following the release of the album a European tour was done, called <i>Into the Killing Zone</i> with <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Ingram_c154.html" title="Dave Ingram">Dave Ingram</a> on vocals<sup id="_ref-Tours_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tours" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After a short <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> tour in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_music.html" title="2001 in music">2001</a> (only 5 dates)<sup id="_ref-Tours_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tours" title="">[4]</a></sup>, they started to work on a new album. <i><a href="../../../h/o/n/Honour_-_Valour_-_Pride_93b6.html" title="Honour - Valour - Pride">Honour - Valour - Pride</a></i> was released in late 2001 on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Blade_Records_0edb.html" title="Metal Blade Records">Metal Blade</a> and shows a progression from the direction taken on <i>Mercenary</i>. It contains 9 tracks; the <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digipak.html" title="Digipak">digipak</a> has one bonus track. Martin Kearns is now back with the band after he settled his things in his life. Alex Thomas departed since he lacked interest in the musical direction of Bolt Thrower.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_music.html" title="2004 in music">2004</a> the band began working on new material for their latest album. They intended to record it in the May of 2004, with the release set to the end of the year by Metal Blade. Meanwhile a European tour and a US tour were prepared. Unfortunately, right before the recording could begin, Dave Ingram decided to leave, due to health and personal issues<sup id="_ref-Ingram_departure_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ingram_departure" title="">[6]</a></sup>. This put off the new record and tours, and priority was set to finding a new singer. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">18 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the band announced the return of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Willetts_1d62.html" title="Karl Willetts">Karl Willetts</a>. Recording of the album, titled <i><a href="../../../t/h/o/Those_Once_Loyal_57db.html" title="Those Once Loyal">Those Once Loyal</a></i>, started in May 2005; it was released on 11 November in Germany, 14 November in the rest of Europe and 15 November in the USA <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_music.html" title="2005 in music">2005</a>. It has been met with widespread critical acclaim from magazines such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Sound_c455.html" title="Rock Sound">Rock Sound</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Hard_7a1d.html" title="Rock Hard">Rock Hard</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Hammer_92be.html" title="Metal Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>. A European tour followed in January and February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_music.html" title="2006 in music">2006</a><sup id="_ref-Tours_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tours" title="">[4]</a></sup> A second leg followed in April, with dates in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and more<sup id="_ref-Tours_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tours" title="">[4]</a></sup>. A US tour was planned to take place later in the year, however lack of financial support from the label forced the band to cancel these plans<sup id="_ref-Interview_with_Willetts_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview_with_Willetts" title="">[7]</a></sup>. The band now considers leaving Metal Blade<sup id="_ref-Interview_with_Willetts_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview_with_Willetts" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Earache has coincided the release of <i>Those Once Loyal</i> with a re-release of the <i>Realm of Chaos</i> featuring new artwork. The band encourage people not to buy it as (like <i>Who Dares Wins</i>) it was released without their consultation let alone consent. Furthermore, it has been alleged that the band has not received royalties from Earache for a number of years<sup id="_ref-BOLT_THROWER_Condemn_EARACHE_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BOLT_THROWER_Condemn_EARACHE" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
