<p>Someone added paragraphs about students being bullied and rules not being enforced. He also added that Bolles never expels students from wealthy families and doesn't enforce its honor code. This is not only false (or exaggerated), but extremely POV. I have removed these paragraphs, and I hope no one will grind his axe on this page again. --<a href="../../../h/p/a/User%7EHpanic7342_f4fd.html" title="User:Hpanic7342">Hpanic7342</a> 02:18, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Whoever you are (and you keep posting anonymously, you coward), I will continue to remove your posts about "hours of free time" and students bullying one another, because they're extremely POV.

<p>Passages like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The school has had significant success in academic competitions. Bolles perennially ranks among the best in state and national Spanish, French, and German competitions. Bolles's top math students have a history of distinguishing themselves at the local, state, and national level in competitions like Mu Alpha Theta. The school's engineering team perennially ranks among the top ten nationwide in competitions like JETS.</dd>
</dl>
<p>are NPOV paragraphs that do not objectively compare Bolles to anything. Actual numbers instead of vague phrasing like "perennially among the best" would help. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcandeto_0bda.html" title="User:Dcandeto">dcandeto</a> 21:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've changed that passage to add some actual ranks and remove what looks like glowing praise. As such, I've removed the NPOV tag.

<p>I'm from the Jacksonville area. When I was younger, whenever I would be bad, my mother would say, "Shape up or you're going to The Bolles!" Of course, this would elicit sobs from me since my mother told me that The Bolles was a school where the kids lived in dorms and didn't go home for most of the week. Is this still true? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 18:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Something like 10% of the Upper School boards at Bolles, so yeah, they do live in dorms, and stay there year-round, like with any boarding prep school. There's also an option to board during the week and go home on the weekends (usually for people who live in Florida or Georgia, but relatively far from Jacksonville). By all accounts the living quarters for boarders are very nice. Of course, the vast majority of students are only day students. -<a href="../../../h/p/a/User%7EHpanic7342_f4fd.html" title="User:Hpanic7342">Hpanic7342</a> 14:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a recent, former alum, I can tell you that there are a number of borders, but none of them local. The vast majority of borders were foreign students, so of course they boarded. Local students never boarded. -<a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajlGT_b535.html" title="User:RajlGT">RajlGT</a></dd>

<p>Jeb Bush (the younger one) certainly went to Bolles and graduated in 2002. His article even says so, so I don't know why someone decided to remove him from the "Notable Alumni" section.

How is being the son of someone worthy of being notable? Florida is in America, not Europe. In America being someone's child does not make you worthy of any entitlement. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.139.251.25 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.139.251.25.html" title="User talk:69.139.251.25">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.139.251.25_2739.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.139.251.25">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>There is a Wikipedia article about him. If he were not notable, that article would be eligible for deletion. If you do not think that he is notable, take up that his issue on his page, not here.

<p>That's a bullshit reason, there's an article about him? Oh, so if I write a fucking article about myself I guess I'm notable too right? Lame. He's done nothign except be born to someone. This is AMERICA, we don't have an aristocracy here.

<dd>If you wrote an article about yourself, assuming you are not notable, the article would be eligible for deletion immediately (and would not last long on Wikipedia).

<p>Somebody changed the numbers of Bolles faculty with certain degrees, but that was information that I got straight from the school's website. If you want to provide evidence for why those numbers should be changed, go ahead, but don't just change them randomly. Also, the bit about community service was changed unnecessarily to a negative slant, and I reverted it back to my wording. Anyone who's ever been anywhere near Bolles knows that the school emphasizes community service among its students, and to say that it "emphasizes sports more than community service" is unverifiable and reeks of sour grapes. - <a href="../../../h/p/a/User%7EHpanic7342_f4fd.html" title="User:Hpanic7342">Hpanic7342</a> 04:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
