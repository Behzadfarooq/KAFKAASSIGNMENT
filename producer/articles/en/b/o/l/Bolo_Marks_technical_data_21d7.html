<p>The Mark I Bolo was introduced in 2000 as a comprehensive upgrade of the <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_Abrams_e831.html" title="M1 Abrams">Abrams</a>. The Mark I mounted a 150&#160;mm cannon which fired <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy_penetrator.html" title="Kinetic energy penetrator">discarding sabot, fin-stabilized, long-rod penetrator</a> (DSFSLRP) rounds, allowing it to defeat the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chobham_armour.html" title="Chobham armour">Chobham</a> armor used on other <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">MBTs</a> of the time. The Mark I was also fitted with computer controlled anti-personnel/point defense <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatling_gun.html" title="Gatling gun">gatlings</a> with integral <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a>, probably similar to the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_CIWS_ca8f.html" title="Phalanx CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a>. The Mark I required a crew of four, was powered by two fossil-fuel power plants, and weighed in at 150 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonne.html" title="Tonne">metric tons</a>. Despite the greatly increased weight, the Mark I had a road speed of 80 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre_per_hour.html" title="Kilometre per hour">km/h</a> and combat radius of 1000 km.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark II</span></h3>
<p>The Mark II Bolo was an updated Mark I first released in 2015. It required only a single crew member due to heavy automation and improved computer controls. The Mark II supplemented the Mark I's <a href="../../../c/i/w/CIWS_af85.html" title="CIWS">CIWS</a> with two <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railgun.html" title="Railgun">railguns</a> on each flank. These railguns were dubbed infinite repeaters, a name that would be adopted to cover all Bolo secondary guns in the coming models. The Mark II was also the first Bolo to be armored with 10&#160;mm of durachrome which greatly increased its survivability compared to the Mark I, rendering it immune to anything less than its own 150&#160;mm DSFSLRP. The Mark II used two fossil-fuel power plants, but these charged a generator and ionic batteries instead of directly connecting to the drive train. Without fuel the batteries could provide 12 hours of power, and could be recharged from a civilian power grid. The Mark II's improvements increased its weight to 194 metric tons, but it retains a road speed of 80&#160;km/h with an off-road speed of 30&#160;km/h. The Mark II was the last Bolo to use only two treads.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_III" id="Mark_III"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark III">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark III</span></h3>
<p>The Mark III Bolo entered service in 2018, not to replace the Mark II, but to supplement it in a heavy support role. The Mark III's 150&#160;mm cannon has only a 20 degree fire arc to the front, but it mounted four 155&#160;mm <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzers</a>, a 60 cell <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_Launching_System_ae16.html" title="Vertical Launching System">Vertical Launching System</a> capable of carrying four missiles per cell (depending on missile size), and eight railgun infinite repeaters. The Mark III was armored with 20&#160;mm of Durachrome which, short of a hit from the Bolo's own 150&#160;mm DSFSLRP at under 250 m, required a contact <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_explosion.html" title="Nuclear explosion">nuclear detonation</a> to breach. The Mark III used only one fossil-fuel power plant, relying instead on using solar film to recharge its batteries. The Mark III was given an improved sensor suite and an electronics officer was added for a total of two crew members, although with automation it could still be run by a single man. The Mark III ran on 4 treads, with the inner and outer pair having separate drive systems. However due to its weight of 300 metric tons the Mark III had a road speed of 50&#160;km/h and an off-road speed of 25&#160;km/h.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_IV" id="Mark_IV"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark IV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark IV</span></h3>
<p>The Mark IV Bolo was introduced in 2116, making it the first post-collapse Bolo. The Mark IV's main armament was a 165&#160;mm railgun, backed by a VLS containing 75 cells with both indirect fire and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">SAM</a> capabilities. The Mark IV's CIWS consisted of six 20&#160;mm infinite repeater railguns supplemented by <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> clusters, making it the first Bolo to mount energy weapons. The Mark IV used the same power plant as the Mark III, but with improved solar film so that it could recharge on the move. The Mark IV was armored with 30&#160;mm of durachrome. The Model B (the first model as <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Corporation_a513.html" title="General Motors Corporation">GM</a> decided that the designations Model A &amp; T had been permanently preempted by <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a>) weighed in at 210 metric tons, and had a road speed of 60&#160;km/h and an off-road speed of 30&#160;km/h. Subsequent models added sensors and additional VLS cells, and so by the end of the Mark IV's operation life the Model H weighed 340 metric tons and had a road speed dropped to 40&#160;km/h, with very little off-road capability.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_V" id="Mark_V"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark V">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark V</span></h3>
<p>The Mark V was introduced in 2160 and was the first model of Bolo capable of deep wading, that is crossing water obstacles without assistance, by buttoning up and driving across the bottom. The Mark V also demanded more power than solar recharging and batteries could supply and so it was fitted with an internal fission plant. The Mark V mounted a 190&#160;mm railgun and twelve 60&#160;mm gatling infinite repeaters (six per side) that fired <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depleted_uranium.html#Projectile_weapons" title="Depleted uranium">depleted uranium rounds</a> as well as lighter gatlings and laser clusters for point defense. <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flechette.html" title="Flechette">Flechette</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosive_material.html#High_Explosives" title="Explosive material">HE</a> launchers supplemented the lasers for anti-personnel work and would become standard on every proceeding Bolo. The Mark V had a reduced missile complement, restricting it to only SAMs. The Mark V weighed 198 metric tons with a road speed of 80&#160;km/h and an off-road speed of 50&#160;km/h, and was crewed by a single operator.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_VI" id="Mark_VI"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark VI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark VI</span></h3>
<p>The Mark VI entered service in 2162 and like the Mark III was designed as a supplementary heavy support unit. The Mark VI had no main gun, instead relying on missile batteries, although it increased the count of 60&#160;mm gatlings to seven on each side, and mounted a larger CIWS system to support surrounding units and act in a counter battery role. Like the Mark V the Mark VI had a one man crew, a road speed of 80&#160;km/h and an off-road speed of 50&#160;km/h, although its weight increased to 238 metric tons.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_VII" id="Mark_VII"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark VII">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark VII</span></h3>
<p>The Mark VII rolled off the production lines in 2163 and was designed as a heavier counterpart of the Mark V and Mark VI. Its main armament consisted of a 200&#160;mm railgun which was backed by a bank of seven 75&#160;mm gatling infinite repeaters on either flank. The Mark VII carried a missile complement that was mainly designed for bombardment, but could be tasked for anti-air duties. The Mark VII used layered durachrome with a total thickness of 120&#160;mm. The Mark VII required a crew of two, with the added man controlling the indirect fire weapons in the Model B, but later being changed to a dedicated air defense and anti-missile position. The Mark VII weighed 348 tons with a road speed of 40&#160;km/h and an off-road speed of 30&#160;km/h.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_VIII" id="Mark_VIII"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark VIII">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark VIII</span></h3>
<p>The Mark VIII came into service in 2209. It was armed with a high velocity 170&#160;mm railgun which gave it greater punch than earlier models despite a smaller bore. The Mark VIII used twelve laser infinite repeaters which were less effective than the gatlings of earlier models, but were lighter and not dependent on a supply of ammunition. The Mark VIII's missile load was reduced compared to previous Bolos and relegated solely to SAM and point defense. However the Mark VIII was equipped four 150&#160;mm rapid fire howitzers to provide it with some indirect fire capability. The Mark VII used a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">fission</a> <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">reactor</a>, but also had solar back up. It required a crew of one, weighed 225 metric tons and had a road speed of 65&#160;km/h with the ability to dash at 85&#160;km/h for short periods with reduced handling.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_IX" id="Mark_IX"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark IX">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark IX</span></h3>
<p>The Mark IX Bolo came out at the same time as the Mark VIII and was designed as a support vehicle. It carried no direct fire weapon instead relying on VLS and four 180&#160;mm high-trajectory howitzers in twin mountings. Improvements in electronics allowed the Mark IX to be crewed by a single individual. It weighed 400 metric tons with a road speed of 57&#160;km/h.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark X">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark X</span></h3>
<p>The Mark X Bolo, introduced in 2235, was the first to mount a laser cannon as its main armament. While less efficient in a transfer of energy per shot basis than previous Bolo weapons, the laser removed the need for ammunition storage in the Mark X. The Mark X used the same laser repeaters and in the same number as the Mark IX, but it upgraded the point defenses to use multibarreled, independently turreted flechette railguns. The Mark X carried only a defensive missile load, and mounted no indirect fire weaponry. It did however have a powerful computer core which allowed it to be run by a single man and in latter models allowed it to be run by pre-loaded battle plans, requiring human intervention only if it encountered something wholly unexpected. The Mark X weighed 350 metric tons, with a road speed of 70&#160;km/h.</p>
<p><a name="Mark_XI" id="Mark_XI"></a></p>

<p>The Mark XI was introduced at the exact same time as the Mark X, and was designed as a fail safe in case the Mark X's laser cannon proved impractical.

<p>Put into service in 2240, the Mark XII was the first "continental siege unit", designed to attack targets on different continents from the one upon which the Mark XII was deployed. The Mark XII's VLS cells were capable of launching <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile.html" title="Intercontinental ballistic missile">ICBMs</a> with <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle.html" title="Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle">MIRVs</a>, or surface-to-space missiles. The Mark XII had no main anti-armor weapon, but had effective anti-air/anti-missile systems. The Mark XII was often paired with a Bolo Ammunition Vehicle, a Mark XII hull with all armaments stripped to provide room for housing extra ammunition. The Mark XII carried a one man crew, although it was primarily designed to be run by preloaded battle plans. It weighed 500 metric tons and had a road speed of 50&#160;km/h.</p>

<p>The Mark XIII entered service only seven years after the Mark XII, but even in this short amount of time technology advanced enough to make the Mark XIII a far more efficient fighting machine. The Mark XIII was for all intents and purposes a Mark XII with anti-armor weapons installed. Even though the added main armament took up 25% of the weight allocated for missile batteries in the Mark XII, the Mark XIII actually had improved bombardment capabilities as advancements in fission power allowed a much smaller reactor to be installed, granting more weight for missiles. The Mark XIII also reduced weight by using flintsteel under a layer of durachrome for armor, instead of pure durachrome. The Mark XII Model B weighed in at 565 metric tons with a road speed of 50&#160;km/h, although later models were able to increase the speed to 75&#160;km/h through better suspension and power trains without increasing weight.</p>

<p>The Mark XIV entered service in 2307 and saw the mounting of a weapon that would become the standard of all future Bolos: The Hellbore Plasmagun. Originally designed as the main battery armament of the Concordiat Navy's Magyar-class battlecruiser, the 25 cm Hellbore delivered half a <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaton.html" title="Megaton">megaton</a> per second and outperformed any laser or projectile weapon of equal mass. The Mark XIV also benefited from mag-bottle technology allowing it to use a fusion plant instead of the fission models used by earlier Bolos. Indirect bombardment capabilities were reduced to only what was necessary at the tactical level, mainly because point defense weapons of the time had become so effective that strategic bombardment had become pointless. By reducing the requirements for indirect fire, the Mark XIV was able to make use of smaller missiles allowing it to increase its missile load out compared to previous Marks of Bolo without a major increase in weight. With so much new technology added the Mark XIV weighed an impressive 728 metric tons which increased to 900 in the later models. However advancements in suspension and drive trains kept it as maneuverable and capable as the Mark XIII, and its road speed stayed between 60 and 75&#160;km/h through all models.</p>

<p>The Mark XV first rolled off the production lines in 2396. The Mark XV was notable in that it was the first Bolo that does not require a human to operate it. Where as other Bolo could function on preset battle plans they still required a human to make decisions that were not included in the plan, but advancements in secure subspace communications and cybernetics allowed the Mark XV to self direct with any human input able to be sent remotely. The Mark XV's cybernetics were separated into two computer cores, a primary and secondary, which were housed in separate compartments to provide redundancy. The Mark XV was armed with a 25 cm Hellbore which could hit any land based target in line of sight, but was not powerful enough to engage orbital targets due to dissipation in the atmosphere. The Hellbore was backed by fourteen gatling laser infinite repeaters, in banks of seven down each flank. The Mark XV also mounted four 20 cm howitzers for tactical bombardment, and in such a role it had capabilities equivalent to a Mark XIV. The Mark XV did away completely with durachrome and instead used pure flintsteel although early models continued to use anti-kinetic <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactive_armour.html" title="Reactive armour">reactive armor</a>, it was removed in later models, marking the last time it was used on a Bolo. Due to a large increase in weight (the Mark XV Model B weighed 1,500 metric tons which increased to over 3,000 by the Model M) the Mark XV required a new suspension system, and a separate power train for each of the six track systems powered by two fusion reactors. The Mark XV had a road speed of 65&#160;km/h, with a short sprint speed of 80&#160;km/h. The Mark XV also had a special Model&#160;L that weighed only 1,100 tons, and was capable of 37% higher combat speeds. It was designed as an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_warfare.html" title="Electronic warfare">EW</a> model.</p>

<p>The Model R, finalized in 2626, was the last model of Mark XV to be produced. It had been up gunned to a 50 cm Hellbore which unlike previous models was able to engage targets in low orbit from within an atmosphere. It also mounted <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablative_armor.html" title="Ablative armor">ablative armor</a> appliqués to help defend it against an increase in vehicle and infantry weapon power. The Model Q had greatly increased EW capabilities, and was the first Bolo whose cybernetics were powerful enough to compare the actually battle conditions to its preloaded battle plans and suggest improvements. With express human authorization, the Models Q and R were able to reconfigure these plans without direct human input, and so while not entirely self directing, they gave a good impression of being so. The Mark XV/R weighed 5,000 metric tons, but maintained a road speed of 65-70&#160;km/h.</p>

<p>The Mark XVI was put into service in 2650 and was designed as a light version of the Mark XV. It maintained the 50 cm Hellbore, but reduced the infinite repeaters to four on each flank. However, the infinite repeaters were upgraded from lasers to ion bolt projectors giving them increased anti-armor performance. The Mark XVI also mounted six breech-loading 20 cm <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a> for anti-infantry work. The ablative appliqués were replaced with an entirely ablative outer hull. The Mark XVI mounted cybernetics of the same quality as the Mark XV/R. Weighed was reduced to 3,600 metric tons and road speed rose to 90&#160;km/h, with sprints up to 100&#160;km/h. The Mark XVI formed the light regiments of the original Dinochrome Brigade.</p>

<p>The Mark XVII was introduced in 2650 along side the Mark XVI as the heavy version of the Mark XV. The Mark XVII's main armament was upgraded to a 60 cm Hellbore, and it mounted fifteen ion-bolt infinite repeaters, six on each flank and three on the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacis.html" title="Glacis">glacis</a>. The Mark XVII removed the mortars found on the Mark XVI and replaced them with six 25 cm howitzers and an increased missile armament.

<p>The Mark XVIII was designed in 2672 to replace both the Mark XVI and XVII, combining the best features of both previous Bolos. The main weapon remained a 60 cm Hellbore, but the ion-bolt infinite repeaters were reduced to six on each flank, as the glacis mounted ones had reduced the structural integrity of the front armor. The Mark XVIII used a three layer hull design consisting of an outer layer of ablative armor, a thin middle layer of duralloy, and a flintsteel inner layer. The Mark XVIII also mounted a third fusion plant, which combined with greater fire control, plasma containment technology, and weapon power allowed the 60 cm Hellbore to engage targets in medium orbit. Later models of the Mark XVIII weighed almost 10,000 metric tons, but it maintained a speed of 70&#160;km/h, with a sprint speed of 80&#160;km/h. At this point, off-road and road speed were nearly the same, due to the mass of the Bolo. The Mark XVIII formed the first general purpose regiments of the Dinochrome Brigade.</p>

<p>Introduced in 2790, the Mark XIX was the first real improvement over the Mark XV, as all following Bolos had up-armored and up-gunned versions of the Mark XV. The Mark XIX was the first Bolo to make use of anti-kinetic battle screens, energy shields which acted as its first line of defense against projectiles. The battle screens were also able to convert energy weapon fire that hit it into power the Bolo could draw on. The Mark XIX was armed with a 60 cm Hellbore backed by sixteen ion-bolt infinite repeaters and 35&#160;mm gatling railguns. The Mark XIX mounted eight 30 cm breech-loading mortars. The Mark XIX was fitted with a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_%28physics%29.html" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>-shedding" ceramic tile appliqué. The Mark XIX weighed 13,000 metric tons with a road speed of 90&#160;km/h and a sprint speed of 120&#160;km/h. Due the drastically increased weight of the Mark XIX a special transport was designed for it. The transport was able to deploy two Mark XIXs in almost any terrain, and was a vast improvement over previous drop pods that had been used, although pods of varying types would remain in service for 400 years.</p>

<p>Introduced in 2796, the Mark XX was the first truly self-directing self-aware Bolo, made possible by breakthroughs psychotronics.

The Mark XX/M was built on refitted Mark XIV's hulls, removing the Hellbore and its turret to make space for a psychotronic system similar to the ones included in normal Mark XX, although with reduced capability. The reduced psychotronic system created a simple personality that had the side effect of being rather blood thirsty.

<p>The Mark XXI was introduced in 2869 and marked a change in the nomenclature of Bolo Marks. Whereas previously major structural changes where given new designations, with the Mark XXI it was decided that only an increase in psychotronic ability would justify a new Mark of Bolo. The Mark XXI mounted a single 60 cm Hellbore. With increases in computing power the Mark XXI was much more capable in combat although outside of combat it had the same restraint programs to prevent it from self direction. The Mark XXI introduced Total Systems Data-Sharing (TSDS) which allowed the bolos to form a distributed intelligence that controlled the actions of all bolos on the field. The Mark XXI also included a special reconnaissance variant the Mark XXI/I.</p>

The Mark XXII also had its kinetic battle screens improved, making them 36% more effect than those of the Mark XXI. The Mark XXII weighed 14,000-15,000 tons depending on the specific model, had a top speed of 80&#160;km/h and a sprit speed of 120-135&#160;km/h.</p>

<p>The Mark XXIII entered service in 2912 in anticipation of the coming conflict with the Quern Hegemony. The Mark XXIII mounted a two 80 cm Hellebores in fore and aft turrets as well as eighteen ion-bolt infinite repeaters with nine mounted on either flank. The Mark XXIII boasted slightly improved psychotronics and its battle screens were supplemented by internal disrupter shields that protected key components of the Bolo. During the war with the Quern, a breakthrough in artificial intelligence circuitry was made and so late Mark XXIIIs were outfitted with molecular circuitry which greatly increased their performance without a corresponding increase in volume. The Mark XXIII also mounted a secondary computer core, giving it greater survivability through redundancy. The Mark XXIII weighed 15,000 metric tons with its speed remaining close to that of the Mark XXII. It was able to maintain a similar weight while increasing its armament due to the weight saved by the new circuits and by switch its armor from flintsteel to a new duralloy which provided the same protection for half the weight.</p>

However, the Mark XXIV was allowed a greater degree of freedom out side of combat than previous models. Although this Mark signaled the beginnings of the movement to completely remove these safeguards, Bolo Central still resisted and only changed its mind after reviewing the battle records from Unit 0075-NKE "Nike" from the Battle of Santa Cruz in 3025. The Mark XXIV mounted a single 90 cm "super" Hellbore. Reducing the main armament did not decrease weight much, and the Mark XXIV still massed 14,000 metric tons.

<p>By 3001 a general consensus was reached by Bolo Central that the inhibitory software loaded on Bolos since the Mark XX was unnecessary and actually hindered combat performance. The Model B therefore had greatly reduced restrictions, and by the Model D (introduced in 3029) virtually all inhibitory software had been removed. The Mark XXV maintained a core package of this software in case a Bolo went rogue through battle damage or poor maintenance with one of the key aspects of this package being the "Omega-Worm" which would completely destroy a rogue Bolo's computer cores. As the restrictions on the Bolo's AI were removed combat performance greatly increased. The Mark XXV essentially duplicated the armor and armament of the Mark XXIV, but due to improvement in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallurgy.html" title="Metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and the efficiency of its fusion plant weight was reduced to 13,000 metric tons.

It mounted three, independently turreted 200 cm Hellbores with a secondary armament of either fourteen 20 cm Hellbore infinite repeaters or sixteen 30 cm Hellbore infinite repeaters<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and a massive indirect fire capability consisting of four 240 cm howitzers, ten 40 cm mortars, and a large VLS compartment. Because of its massive weight and armament, the Mark XXXIII was often referred to as a <i>planetary siege unit</i>. The total number of Mark XXXIIIs built is unknown, but doctrine called for them to be deployed in brigades of 24. The Mark XXXIII had a max speed similar to that of the Mark XXXII, but the Mark XXXIII also mounted an <i>internal</i> counter-grav system powerful enough to make orbital insertions and allow flight at speeds up to 500 km/h.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark XXXIV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark XXXIV</span></h3>
<p>Although no exact date is known, the Mark XXXIV was introduced sometime between 3356 and 3408, during the Human-Melconian War. The Mark XXXIV mounts two Hellbores, mortars, twelve infinite repeaters and two Hellrails. The Hellrail is a 60 m long energy weapon with a yield of 90 megatons per bolt fired, with a cooldown time of around a minute. The Hellrail was designed to provide orbital cover for Bolo brigades as the Hellrails were able to engage ships before they entered orbit. Nothing is known about the weight of the Mark XXXIV, but it has a combat sprint speed of at least 200&#160;km/h. The Mark XXXIV is 90 m long.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_Marks_technical_data_21d7.html" title="Edit section: Mark XXXIV (Resurgent)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark XXXIV (Resurgent)</span></h3>
<p>Another version of the Mark XXXIV called the "Resurgent" was developed by the Republic of Indrani from plans of the Mark XXXII and XXXIII. The Resurgent was two hundred and twelve meters in length and thirty five in width. Armament consisted of two primary turrets each mounting a pair of 210cm Hellbores. Both turrets had a 360 degree field of fire. Secondary armament was made up of 24 35cm hellbore infinite repeaters mounted in 12 independent turrets along with a sizeable complement of missile tubes, mortar capabilities, and antipersonnel clusters. The Resurgent class boasted improved armor in both thickness and anti-plasma appliqués. Finally the Resurgent was fully counter-grav capable able to operate totally independent of any assault pod.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious differences in these two classes of Mark XXXIV Bolos they are both have the same Mark designation. This is most likely due to the dark periods after the Melconian-Concordiate wars when commucation with human settlements was tenous at best. The Resurgent of the Indrani Republic was developed independently of Concordiat influence while the Mark XXXIV sporting the Hellrails was developed under the Concordiat itself. In practice the Resurgent could be considered a Mark XXXV.</p>
