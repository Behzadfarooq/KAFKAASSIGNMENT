<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_%28tank%29.html" title="Edit section: Description and history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description and history</span></h2>
<p>Bolos are a series of super-heavy tanks controlled by <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-aware.html" title="Self-aware">self-aware</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligences</a>. They were originally developed in the late 20th/early 21st century by the Bolo Division of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Corporation_a513.html" title="General Motors Corporation">General Motors</a> in the United States. As humanity spread beyond Earth, the Bolos followed to protect the Empire, and later the Concordiat. For millennia they provided the bulwark of humanity's defense, participating in numerous wars against various aliens, most notably against the Deng and the Melconians in the 30th century. Bolos are assigned most famously to the Dinochrome Brigade, which traces its lineage back to various units on Earth, though there are also machines attached to Planetary Siege Regiments.</p>
<p>The concept behind the Bolo is that of being "the perfect <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a>". Bolos are intended to be invincible, but also completely loyal. Their psychotronic brains undergo rigorous testing before being installed in a machine. They are programmed to avoid killing humans unless by explicit order of their human commanders. One of the greatest fears of humans is that a Bolo's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming.html" title="Programming">programming</a> will become corrupted and will go rogue. Indeed this happened in <i>Rogue Bolo</i>, and Bolos were turned against their human masters in <i>Bolo Rising</i> and <i>Bolo Strike</i>. As Bolo technology has advanced, the machines have become increasingly autonomous. The first Bolo was essentially a very powerful conventional <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a> equipped with various <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servo.html" title="Servo">servos</a> and mechanical devices to assist the crew. Other early Bolos could be put on automated patrol patterns. Starting with the Mark XX, Bolos became capable of fully independent operation (without a human commander), and with the advent of the Mark XXX, true independent, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_planning.html" title="Strategic planning">strategic planning</a> was possible.</p>
<p><a name="Bolo_offensive_systems" id="Bolo_offensive_systems"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo_%28tank%29.html" title="Edit section: Bolo offensive systems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bolo offensive systems</span></h2>
<p>A basic Bolo is roughly the equivalent in firepower to a division of heavy infantry with artillery support. Later Bolo models are classified as Continental Siege Units, and the Mark XXX and above could usually take on an entire planet's defenders by themselves.</p>
<p>The main weapon of early Bolo Marks was either an enhanced tank <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">gun</a> (Early marks featured DSFSLRP, or discarding sabot, fin-stabilized, long-rod penetrator munitions) or a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railgun.html" title="Railgun">railgun</a>. As Mankind moved off-planet and the Bolo designs became bigger and more powerful; these were replaced by a Laser Cannon for a short period of time, until the Hellbore was developed. The Hellbore is a complex plasma weapon mounted on a turret, akin to other main guns. On some models, there are more than one main guns, and most recent models have smaller "support" Hellbores. Hellbore power output is measured in megatons/second, although the diameter of the tube is also often used as a quantifying measure. Hellbores in the 90cm and larger range can destroy orbiting spaceships from the ground with one shot — indeed, these weapons are also used as main batteries on Concordiat Star Fleet's <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">Battleships</a>.</p>
<p>Hellbore <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> consists of slivers of highly-pressurized frozen <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> which are heated to a plasma state when fired. The resulting bolt is then accelerated magnetically to a considerable fraction of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_speed.html" title="Light speed">light speed</a> to avoid dispersing before hitting the target. Later Bolo marks are capable of internally manufacturing Hellbore rounds, using water as a raw material, whereby the hydrogen is extracted via electrolysis and cooled cryogenically into splinters of frozen hydrogen. The Mark XXXIV carries a variant of the Hellbore known as the Hellrail, an anti-starship railgun weapon, possessing an output of 90 megatons per shot. Hellrails are designed for planetary defense and cannot normally be depressed to strike ground targets.</p>
<p>Bolos are also equipped with rapid-firing batteries known as infinite repeaters, though the term later came to be used to automatic secondary weapons with anti-armor ability. On early models, these were <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatling_guns.html" title="Gatling guns">Gatling guns</a> or small-bore railguns. Later Marks progressed to energy weapons such as lasers and ion-based weapons, and finally to small Hellbores. Depending on the Bolo, additional secondary armaments include rapid-fire <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a>, heavy <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzers</a>, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missiles</a>, anti-personnel <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flechette.html" title="Flechette">flechette</a> launchers, and other point-defense weapons to intercept incoming threats. Bolos are equipped with both conventional and thermonuclear missiles, though they will use the latter only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Mark XXXIIIs are known to carry <i>Dragon</i> hover-tanks and <i>Wyvern</i> scout flyers in combat in order to scout for, and to supplement the firepower of, the Bolo itself.</p>

<p>The complex <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor.html" title="Armor">armor</a> of a Bolo Unit of the Line can withstand direct hits from all weapons systems up to (and in later models, including) nuclear weapons. Hulls are built of either durachrome, or the stronger endurachrome, with a drivetrain made out of flintsteel. Later Marks were also protected by energized battlescreens, both external and internal. These battlescreens could convert much of the damage done by enemy weapons fire into energy that would be redirected into the Bolo's own weapons.</p>
<p>Each unit is also equipped with an impressive array of sensing equipment for all light conditions, <a href="../../../i/r/_/IR_4f74.html" title="IR">IR</a>, magnetic spectrum, and <a href="../../../f/t/l/FTL_ce6c.html" title="FTL">FTL</a> comm. Units also came equipped with stealthy flying drones and other remote sensing capabilities, with later models having the capabilities to orbit their own MILSAT <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_satellite.html" title="Spy satellite">spy satellites</a>. Bolos also contain their own maintenance robots to repair battle damage.</p>
<p>All power for weapons, battlescreens, and mobility is provided by one or more <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion_power.html" title="Fusion power">fusion</a> <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactors.html" title="Reactors">reactors</a>. As a last resort, Bolos may detonate their reactors to destroy an enemy, or at the very least, thwart capture.</p>

<p>Each Bolo contains several computer "cores" with different functions, each of which contains multiple fully functional duplicates in case of failure. If a Bolo's logic becomes dysfunctional enough, it regresses to the original Resartus protocol, which was embedded in all following models just for such a case.</p>
<p>Many Bolo stories are told from the point of the view of the Bolo itself, with its internal thoughts printed in italics throughout the text.</p>

<p>One of the defining characteristic that resounds in all the works is the Knight in Shining Armour. In many stories, Humanity is redeemed via the Bolo service and self-sacrifice and reminds Humanity what honour is.</p>
