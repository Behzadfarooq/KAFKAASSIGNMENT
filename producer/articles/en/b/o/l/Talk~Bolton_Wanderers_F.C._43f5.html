<p>How can McAteer and Stubbs not be noted on the famous past players list??? --vega007</p>
<p>They are now.</p>
<p>Hi, can someone put <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Al_Habsi_8d56.html" title="Ali Al Habsi">Ali Al Habsi</a> on the bolton player list? Thanks <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent003_f36b.html" title="User:Agent003">Agent003</a> edit: ok never mind done it!! thanks</p>
<p>please dont put borgetti on the players list he doesnt even play for us yet! and the top 4 include EVERTON liverpool are not in the top 4 unless they finish there this season get it right! <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.255.32.12.html" title="User:62.255.32.12">user:62.255.32.12</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Liverpool are one of the 'Top 4', Everton did well last year but need to finish in the top 4 about 8 more times to get into the 'Top 4' category. Everton are ranked as 'best english teams outside top 4' with Bolton and Middlesbrough. as for Borgetti, he signed for Bolton earlier this month. And is part of the Bolton Wanderers squad. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent003_f36b.html" title="User:Agent003">Agent003</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>no i suggest you check the official bolton site my friend and look at big sams comments in which he states that a deal for borgetti is still a 'LONG WAY OFF' let me paste his comments for you</p>
<p>"Borgetti is a player I would like to bring to the club but we are still a long way off doing a deal with him," Allardyce told the club's website.</p>
<p>"We won't have any indication if a deal can be done until he arrives in England until then it is out of our hands.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, i accept that at the moment that deal is now 'A LONG WAY OFF', this was only announced this morning. i did update the main page with this information. - <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent003_f36b.html" title="User:Agent003">Agent003</a></dd>

<p>Is there some way of putting the real kit pictures on the page? No soz mate its copyright. Extremely good idea though you must be really mint</p>
<p>Their is no substance to the fact that Vernon Kay and Dave Spikey are Notlob fans, simply being unfortunate enough to hail from Bolton does not make you a fan! Whats next Peter Kay and Sarah Cox?????? oh no I forgot Tes Daly: guilty by association!</p>
<p>I've reverted Vernon Kay and Dave Spikey back into the famous fans. This is not a football forum. If you want to argue about these in a civilised manner then please do. If not go onto a football forum like 606. (<a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuentin_X_cfa5.html" title="User:Quentin X">Quentin X</a> 21:06, 26 November 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>So basically what you are saying is that it is ok for you to speculate about who may or may not support your team without backing up your statements, but you will not allow anyone else to do the same. I fully understand the removal of some of the more ellaborate claims, but to remove both Ray Stubbs and Simon Weston, is both wrong and somewhat inconsistant when compared to the claims you make on this infomation page.</p>
<p>It is not mine nor any other Tranmere Rovers fans fault that you are incapable of beating us. Nor is it our fault that on the majority of footballing occasions we have met we have humbled you!</p>
<p>Aside from the ridiculous claims to famous fans, one suggests leaving us well alone, that is untill we meet again, then by all means feel free to add another chapter to the TRFC beat Bolton saga!</p>
<p>Thankyou and goodnight!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ridiculous claims you say. Whereas Spikey and Kay have been backed up by links to other sites the link for Simon Weston has not, only the noble Weston Spirit. Add a link and I'll say no more.</li>
<li>You will also notice that I have removed Peter Kay's name a number of times from Bolton's list as it is known that he is a Man U fan.</li>
<li>As for Ray Stubbs, my problem is this. As I have said before, he played for the club and on his retirement worked for the club. He probably was a fan before he joined the club but to put him in the famous fans section is the same as putting Johnny King and John Aldridge as they are noted elsewhere in the piece. Either have him in one or the other.</li>
<li>And please, stop with the club rivalry. It isn't doing you any favours. (<a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuentin_X_cfa5.html" title="User:Quentin X">Quentin X</a> 17:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC))</li>

<dd>IMO the entire section should be removed, as it isn't particularly encyclopedic. Discussions regarding similar sections on other articles generally favour removal e.g <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_Archive2_e203.html#Fans" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football/Archive2">1</a> <a href="../../../a/r/s/Talk%7EArsenal_F.C._Archive_1_1ca4.html#Famous_Arsenal_fans" title="Talk:Arsenal F.C./Archive 1">2</a>. If someone's support for Bolton is truly notable it can be mentioned in their page. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 19:20, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think Bolton actually are generally considered one of the best teams outside the top four. Could you source that please? I'd suggest that a lack of recent trophies, no participation in Europe until this coming season and generally lacklustre performance would suggest that Bolton are far from one of the "best". In any case, this kind of judgement is far better included as a quote than as a statement of fact. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Arthur_6320.html" title="User:Philip Arthur">Philip Arthur</a> 06:07, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Note this: "Since then, Bolton Wanderers have preserved their Premiership place with 16th, 17th, 8th and in the season 2004/5 6th place which gave them their first ever qualification for European football." This would suggest that Bolton has been improving but there just isn't any consistent achievement there. Hope the Trotters fans among us won't take it too amiss. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Arthur_6320.html" title="User:Philip Arthur">Philip Arthur</a> 06:09, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But since being in the premiership the have got to the Carling cup final and FA Cup Quarter-final.</p>

<dd>I am of the opinion that putting previous club or other biographical information about players is unnecessary as it is available by clicking on the player's name and looking at their article. For year signed, this raises questions, for example should this mean the year the first contract with the club is signed or the year of first team debut? In the West Ham example this varies. Of course, this is all just in my opinion. If you wish to put forward the West Ham style as a proposed standard template, I'd suggest leaving a message at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_Clubs_af53.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football/Clubs">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football/Clubs</a> as it will reach more people on there. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 22:05, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
