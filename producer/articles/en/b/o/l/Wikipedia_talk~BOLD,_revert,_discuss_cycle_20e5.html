<p>Just wanted to say, this is great stuff. I've been thinking along these lines for a while but this is a nice explanation. I think people would have far fewer concerns over boldness and IAR'ing if the bold rule-ignorers always took the advice of this page: be bold, <b>once</b>. When someone disagrees, the time for boldness is over and the time for discussion begins. This simple idea prevents edit wars but doesn't bog us down with unneeded ceremony.</p>
<p>Also, I suppose people have already noticed this, but the <a href="../../../p/u/r/WP%7EPURE_1d1c.html" title="WP:PURE">pure wiki deletion system</a> comes from applying the bold/revert/discuss cycle to deletions. If something should go away, boldly remove it. If someone disagrees, they'll revert, and then you discuss it. I wonder if people will start voicing opposition to bold/revert/discuss for the same reasons they oppose PWDS. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:07, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
In all honesty, I think this is bad stuff tending toward chaos. I'm not all that sure what the <i>rational</i> purpose of such a change would be, I certainly do not see how it would be beneficial to anyone (except maybe someone trying to force a radical idea into an article). One generally does not reach a consensus through open warfare, which is essentially what this looks like to me. I just don't see this as a workable solution.</p>

<dd>Ah! On rereading. No this is not open warfare. More like a kind of trap, but this is a friendly trap. You set your bait, and wait for someone to nibble. Instead of hurting them though, you engage them in discussion. Then, when you've reached agreement, re-set the trap and wait for the next person to come along. Keep going until no one bites. This way you use a trap to catch new friends, for a change.

<p>I don't understand what this page has to do with dispute resolution or why it would be difficult to implement. This is the way we edit every day.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you see something that you think needs changing on an article, it's best if you just be bold and change it.</li>
<li>If someone doesn't like your edit (which won't happen that often, unless you're being disruptive or really enjoy editing controversial articles), they will revert it.</li>
<li>At this point, don't revert again or you're revert warring.</li>
<li>Instead, discuss the edit on the talk page.</li>
<li>After significant discussion, update the page:
<ul>
<li>If there was a consensus, change according to consensus</li>
<li>If discussion dies off, change according to whatever was generally agreed upon</li>
<li>If no one will compromise and reach a true consensus, consensus degrades to majority rule. Change according to the majority.</li>
<li>If no discussion occurs at all and no one responds to your attempt at discussion, wait a significant period of time (depends on the popularity of the article), and then start over at step 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not really dispute resolution; it's just the normal editing cycle. It could be seen as dispute <i>prevention</i>, I guess. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 17:27, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I sure hope it's not becoming the standard modus operandi around here. I'd prefer if people actually talked things through beforehand and so. I wrote this page to describe an emergency measure when all else fails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is as close to the normal way of working as possible, but it skips things like waiting a significant amount of time, and tries to keep discussion moving rapidly, and is slightly less amenable to compromise.

<dd>Hmm, well the thing is I've managed to get myself into all kinds of interesting trouble by following the steps as stated here. *Scratches head*. Hmmm, I guess it's troublesome because it's a situation where go in and be bold even though you <b>know</b> you're going to get reverted. You just want to find out by who. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hmm reading your steps in more detail</dd>
<dd>* This is about being bold when you know there's 100% chance of being reverted. And still you edit.</dd>
<dd>* You wish to unrevert the change in as short a time as possible (perhaps something like 30 minutes), even though you know you'll likely get reverted again. (though by a different person.)</dd>
<dd>* Discussing on the talk page is slow, try irc or instant messaging wherever possible.</dd>
<dd>* Significant discussion with multiple people should be avoided. Significant discussion with one person at a time should be pursued strongly.</dd>
<dd>* We are attempting to provoke discussion. If discussion dies off with no change, you have failed.</dd>
<dd>* Majority rule kills consensus dead. Bold revert discuss will not work in an established majority rule system. Fortunately, often people only *claim* their system is majority rule. Since in practice a wiki typically needs at least some amount of consensus in its daily operations, you might be able to wedge your way in. Expect heavy resistance from proponents of majority rule however!</dd>
<dd>Maybe you can imagine some of the ways you can get in trouble now?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand this page at all. It says "This method is typically used by experienced wiki-editors on policy or high profile pages, <b>when all else has failed</b>. <b>Large amounts of diplomacy</b> are required to pull it off successfully there." What does it have to do with high-profile pages or diplomacy? This is the normal way that everyone edits. What other "cycles" or editing styles are there? I can't think of any. When <i>what</i> else has failed? There isn't anything else. This is how you edit a wiki. You are always bold when editing, and if someone reverts you discuss on the talk page. This is normal and good, not a special case. What alternative editing styles are there? I don't get it. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 03:48, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. Normally it's not a cycle. You are bold and it sticks, or you are bold, get reverted, discuss, come to consensus, and the consens goes up. DONE. You're right that you could use a slightly friendlier version for normal everyday editing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I wrote the page I was thinking of particular cases where things were going in a tight cycle (often &lt;30 minutes per iteration), and was used on pages with a large amount of sunk investment and people were deadlock. I got the wikinews main page changed quite rapidly, for example. People even thought they were using majority rule on wikinews at the time, I think&#160;;-) <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 08:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i><b>Alternative to reverting: move to talk===</b></i> Rather than revert a user's edit, and hope not to be reverted again, a more productive option is to move their content to the article's talk page where it can be discussed. While the content is still removed from the article, the action is less harsh because the content is still viewable outside of history, is more easily referenced in discussion, and the discussion is not limited to edit summaries pushing eachother closer to breaking the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>.</p>
<p>While true and wise, this situation shouldn't occur in a bold revert discuss cycle. If it does, and holds you may well have managed to break out. Congratulations. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 21:34, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Easy, it's where you figure out how to do stuff and try them out, and after a while of trying it out on the wiki, you write down what you've figured out. And of course it's a wiki!

<ul>
<li>Certainly. Kim is of the opinion (and I tend to agree) that we should have less tags in WikiSpace. However, to do that she has created an <i>extra</i> tag ({{<a href="../../../d/e/s/Template%7EDescriptive_d201.html" title="Template:Descriptive">descriptive</a>}}) which to me seems counterproductive. It is apparent that novice users are confused if pages are tagging wrongly; an extra tag conflates this problem. The tag implies that there are several "kinds" of guidelines, which implies that some hold more weight than others - which is false. Then, there is no such thing as an "old-style guideline", that's just a new made-up term. And finally, the tag describes pages as "guidelines" even though they aren't, further adding to the confusion.
<ul>
<li>Originally all pages in the project namespace were called our guidelines, IIRC. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> (other answers below)</li>

<li>That's why {{<a href="../../../d/e/s/Template%7EDescriptive_d201.html" title="Template:Descriptive">descriptive</a>}} is not such a good idea. This particular page, however, could qualify as a regular guideline, and I would have no objection tagging it as such. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Marking this page an essay is a really bad fit. It's not an essay expressing a personal opinion. (It's an observation of working methods across multiple wikis. )</li>
<li>Marking this page as a guideline would suggest that it's some kind of rule that must be followed. It's not, and it shouldn't be mandatory.</li>
<li>If you leave the page unmarked, our friendly graffiti-taggers (sorry, template-projecteers) will come along and stick some random tag on.</li>
<li>Solution: Create a tag that says the page describes how to do things, and stick that on. No complaints, because it's true. Also, no graffiti taggers will come along. Perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, almost perfect. Now someone comes along and declares the tag</p>
<ul>
<li>redundant with essay? (the essay tag describes itself as something else)</li>
<li>redundant with guideline? (No, that would imply a rule)</li>
<li>has no consensus? (As per Bold Revert Discuss, we may reject that statement&#160;;-) )</li>
</ul>
<p>So I figure the tag stays for now. Ideally I think we need to get rid of graffiti tags.</p>

<li>You are mistaken as to the nature of guidelines. Guidelines aren't mandatory.

<dd>Tagging is apparently at-random, as I have described many times before in multiple places. The "nature of guidelines" is also random, as per that same description. People have in fact been blocked or banned by the arbcom for failing to follow pages marked as "guideline". Even if guidelines were not random; even if guidelines were to work exactly as you state; people will still voluntarily follow them for day-to-day wiki-work. That is not the intent of this page. So the guideline tag does not fit either. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 16:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, there are several ways of creating guidelines, and one of them surely is the original. But, whichever way we arrive at a guideline, the end result is a guideline, and all such are equal. We should not be giving people the ammunition to create the impression that some guidelines are more important than others.

<p>the way you've rewritten this page it promotes doing anything to get people's attention, and calling it their fault if they revert it.

<p>I agree with Radiant's initial worry, only more strongly. This approach seems to me simply to regularise a standard approach taken by PoV-pushers across Wikipedia: you make a large, significant, and undiscussed change at an article, and then try to wear down those who disagree. The only sensible option is to revert the change, and tell the person who made it to discuss the issues at Talk first; what is the advantage for a good-faith editor of doing things this way? all that you're likely to do is turn the other editors against you from the beginning. This "essay" allows the offender a further gambit: when editors protest that there's no consensus for the edit, the PoV-warrior says: "Well, I'm going by the book — see <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>".</p>
<p>At best, this is an approach that would be attractive to someone who rejects Wikipedia's basic approach to article writing, and wants to impose her own views against or without consensus. Having come here because it was being appealed to in precisely such a situation by its creator and chief author, I don't think that that's a merely hypothetical judgement. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 09:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>So the justification for this essay is that what it describes is exactly what is already prescribed under existing guidelines? I don't agree, but I'm puzzled as to what the point of it would be if that were the case.</p>
<p>Building up consensus one by one is a peculiar notion (and misuses the term "consensus" along the way); again, having seen it in action, it seems simply to mean going off in little corners for huddled whispers in secret, coming back and saying "we agree", and then doing the same with the next person (unless you think you can get away with claiming consensus after one iteration). I don't like secret conversaions, any more than I like the use of IRC and mailing lists to stand in for proper, public, open discussion.</p>
<p>It's no good, I find this essay wrong headed, potentially disruptive, and with no obvious advantages. In fact, I find it so worrying that I've nominated it for deletion. It shouldn't be the way that people do things, and it certainly shouldn't be the way that they're encouraged to do things. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 17:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With BRD it's less relevant, since you're really more interested in the reverter than in his revert. Even so, I see no harm in placing what basically amounts to an extended edit summary on the talk page at any time. With BRD you should just be extra careful not to get ensnarled on the talk page if you do so, however. Your objective is to get the knots out of the actual editing of the page in question, so that editors can get their work done.--<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 13:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Interestingly, the flowchart at Wikipedia:Consensus is actually correct. You always first want to try wiki editing, before you go to talk. In fact, roughly 90% of the time, your edits will stand, and no further action is required. I'm inferring this from existing statistics and trends. This is less surprising than it might seem to you.<br />
Wikipedia is a wiki, after all.&#160;:-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree about the 90% rule, but those are the 90% that are not disputed. As a method of conflict resolution, we have to focus on the bottom 2% - those that cause edit wars. And I really don't think it creates good faith if you just do bold, controversial edits without explaining your motives. AGF cuts both ways - everybody should also give each other reasons to assume good faith. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 06:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As stated above, it's ok to make a bold change and basically use the talk page for an extended edit summary (one of the first goals for such a page). That's also quite fine for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>. Just don't be tempted to procrastinate on the talk page for a whole week, while a simple edit might only take you 10 minutes, and will work just fine as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>, the method will likely work even without a talk page comment. I do agree that leaving a comment on talk upfront does tend to soften the blow a little. On the other hand, there's a slight danger that you could end up holding discussions with people who you didn't need to talk with.</dd>
<dd>I'll add a note to reflect this. (you could have been bold and done this yourself, by the way)&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 11:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
