<p>"Subsequently, Pedro Carmona, the head of the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the nation's business federation, was proclaimed president, in clear violation of Venezuela's constitution.".</p>
<p>How was it a clear vioation? I think many would interpret the stepping up of Carmona as adhering to article 350, which states:</p>
<p>"El pueblo de Venezuela, fiel a su tradición republicana, a su lucha por la independencia, la paz y la libertad, desconocerá cualquier régimen, legislación o autoridad que contraríe los valores, principios y garantías democráticos o menoscabe los derechos humanos."</p>
<p>"The people of Venezuela, loyal to their republican tradition, to their fight for independence, peace, and liberty, will disavow any regime, legislation or authority that either goes against democratic values, guarantees, and principles or undermines human rights"</p>
<p>For instance, commanding the activation of Plan Avila , ie deploying and setting the army against a several hundred-thousands-strong demonstration of almost totally unarmed opponents, consciously forseeing and encouraging a massacre, is at least my interpretation of abusing human rights (I'm not saying that Carmona did right in enacting all those improvised decrees under his rule either, but can you put those two abuses in the same light?). What about publicly firing numerous PDVSA employees without warning on national TV? That's clearly disregarding democratic guarantees, and is normally seen as a major event that sparked the opposition demonstration.</p>
<p>I'm not mentioning any other of Chavez's abuses of the Constitution for now.</p>

<dd>Is not so much of a POV, the supreme court of justice once absolved the military actors involved on this episode claiming a "power vacuum" that rose to power to Mr. Carmona. It wasn't a coupe d'etate. The violation to the consitution debate can come when analyzing what happened after he was appointed president of the republic.</dd>

<p>I think that this article is badly stacked in favor of Chávez. There are many people who like the man and his philosophy, but he also has many detractors. In its current state, I'm not sure that the article serves the needs of readers.</p>
<p>Personally, I agree with Chávez's purported ideology, but also suspect that he is sometimes vain, paranoid, and/or knuckleheaded. He once cut off oil supplies to the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Republic_1b44.html" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> because of his bizarre belief that then-President <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip%C3%B3lito_Mej%C3%ADa_27ca.html" title="Hipólito Mejía">Hipólito Mejía</a> was involved in an assasination plot.</p>

<dd>There is historical precedent for Chávez' claim.

<p>"The example of Venepal has inspired many of Chávez's supporters to call for a completely socialist <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>. Some within Chávez's political party believe that nationalizing the economy would incur retaliation from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, nonetheless the Bolivarian Revolution is quickly developing into a socialist movement." - I'd like to see some sources to back this up. My understanding of the mainstream of the movement is that it is more about a old-style (50s-70s) European social democracy (i.e. control of key companies and sectors) than a "planned economy" in the Soviet sense, which is what is generally implied by that term. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 20:42, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

 ===Lead-up to the Revolution===
</pre>
<p>During the sixties the world as a whole saw a general shift towards redistribution of power and wealth favouring the underprivileged sectors. During the seventies and eighties profits of large corporations fell due to better labour organizations, nationalist policies of Third World countries, increasing taxes, and better state regulation. During the first decades of the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punto_Fijo_2213.html" title="Punto Fijo">Punto Fijo</a> regime, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> enjoyed increasing equality and general improvements in the standard of living. Employment rates increased and better education allowed Venezuelans a great degree of social mobility. They increasingly viewed themselves as a society that was inclusive, racially democratic, and <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarian.html" title="Egalitarian">egalitarian</a>. The late seventies saw a decline in these trends. The debt crisis of 1983 hit Venezuelans especially hard because they expected growth and progress, not devaluation of currency and a deterioration in living conditions. It is estimated that in the decade after the debt crisis <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a> in Venezuela nearly doubled. The fluid society of the sixties and seventies no longer existed and social segregation increased. The upper and middle class came to see the lower class as an enemy. Such a decline in society led to an increasingly ineffective, corrupt, and unresponsive government. Demonstrations, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caracazo.html" title="Caracazo">Caracazo</a>, showed Venezuelans' discontent with the governing bodies. This disillusionment led, in 1998, to the election of <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Chavez_1fdf.html" title="Hugo Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a> and his <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_for_the_Fifth_Republic_89ad.html" title="Movement for the Fifth Republic">Movement for the Fifth Republic</a> political party.

<p>I as a Venezuelan find the discussion about racism strange. Racism is definitely a disgrace, but comparatively speaking I find racism in my country is less acute than in any other country I know of or have visited. Almost everywhere else dark skinned people are worse of than white onces, be that in the USA, in Europe, in Asia, even in Africa. Foremost I might need to say: My ancestors were black, Indian and some European, my family definitely looks like the median Venezuelan. If you want to write about racism as an issue, you should do so about every single country in the world. It is true that black people tend to be poorer, but that has less to do with any meaningful racism in the last decades or so, but with the whole heritage: if you have parents with a good education, you tend to be better off. For decades now people in Venezuela could reach any job more easily regardless the colour of their skin than elsewhere. You mention Hugo Chavez is called "ape". So are blond people. Actually "mono titi", a very light-haired monkey (almost yellow), is a slang word for "blond person". The "mono" alone is to say someone is "silly" and not of any given colour, at least in Venezuela.</p>
<p><br />
You are right; they discuss racism as if where US racism, but it's not</p>
<p>I'm backing you here. Racism?...give me a break. Of course dark-skinned people are sometimes used to portray criminals...it is not just meanness from the media, it is a statistic fact. Think about it, lets put our subjective thoughts aside: most robbers come from the lower strata of the social ladder and most of the people in the lower strata are not white. Plus, I've seen plenty of white and "mulato" people playing criminals and maids on Venezuelan shows. The "monkey" argument regarding the President Hugo Chávez is debatable, he is compared to a monkey, not because of the "animal quality" but because of the "behavioural quality". --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspazolano_8d65.html" title="User:Espazolano">Espazolano</a> 23:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
