<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bold_%28Farthing_Wood%29_bfc0.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Bold was born in <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Deer_Park_fec2.html" title="White Deer Park">White Deer Park</a> to <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_%28Farthing_Wood%29_1704.html" title="Fox (Farthing Wood)">Fox</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/x/Vixen_%28Farthing_Wood%29_2f31.html" title="Vixen (Farthing Wood)">Vixen</a> of Farthing Wood. From a very young age Bold showed an amazing amount of courage which the other animals said he got from his father. However Bold would often have more <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravery.html" title="Bravery">bravery</a> than <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>, which would get him into trouble many times through out his life.</p>
<p>When his sister 'Dreamer' was killed (possibly by <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface_%28Farthing_Wood%29_7a1a.html" title="Scarface (Farthing Wood)">Scarface</a> or Lady Blue) he was determined to stand up to Scarface and the other Blue Foxes for what happened. Ignoring warnings from his father he went to Blue Fox territory, he was very quickly captured by the Blue Foxes but found a way to escape back to Farthing Animal territory. However what he did not know was that both his Father and his Brother ‘Friendly’ were already on their way to rescue him.</p>
<p>Afterwards Fox would confront his unruly son about his behaviour, telling him to stay within his sight for as long as he deemed fit. Bold however wanted to escape from his Father’s shadow and decided to leave White Deer Park and never to return.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bold_%28Farthing_Wood%29_bfc0.html" title="Edit section: Life outside White Deer Park">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life outside White Deer Park</span></h2>
<p>Bold was originally thrilled at the concept of living his own life and following his own rules. But his happiness was cut short when he began to both see and experience how harsh life is beyond the safety of White Deer Park. Although he befriended ‘Crow’ and a Badger named ‘Shadow’ he ignored their warnings about moving around in the day time due to heavy <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">hunting</a>. His left eyelid was scarred when he freed Shadow from an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_trap.html" title="Animal trap">animal trap</a>. Soon afterwards thanks to not being able to see properly because of his injury, he was shot trying to escape from a hunter. Though he survived, his gunshot wound prevented him from hunting successfully after a few failed attempts. Crow finally managed to convince him to go to a nearby town in order to scavenge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bold_%28Farthing_Wood%29_bfc0.html" title="Edit section: Whisper">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Whisper</span></h2>
<p>Bold found it hard to adjust to the town at first, claiming it was too noisy. He also began to regret leaving White Deer Park, but he was determined never to go back on principle. He soon met a vixen who turned out to be the only love of his life; her name was ‘Whisper’. Originally she took pity on him because of his injury and helped him to hunt for food. She eventually invited him to stay at her den in an old Church cemetery. When Bold told her about his family heritage she became his mate, hoping that her offspring would take after Fox. This left Bold emotionally shattered when she told him just after she announced that she was pregnant. Whisper wanted her cubs to be born in White Deer Park with family so she forced Bold to return with her to the park.</p>

<p>Bold found the trip back harsh, his injury had made him very weak. Whisper soon began to realise the sacrifice Bold was making for his cubs and eventually fell in love with him. When Bold finally arrived back he was just too exhausted to continue and went to die alone. But his mother and father arrived just before he passed away to say one last goodbye. Bold died happily with the knowledge that his cubs would be safe and that his Father said he was so proud of him.</p>
