<h2><span class="mw-headline">Studios in History</span></h2>
<p>I am not clear on this, but I think there used to be signing a contract by an artist with a studio. This would bind the artist to perform only for that studio for the period of the contract. The studios would roll out films. The studios are later on converted into shopping mall, as the real estate prices went up and cost of film production did not give good returns. Someone who is closed to this history can tell better. Shoppers Stop in Andheri was connected to either studio or a cinema house. Also the word talkies = talking movies need presentation in history of bollywood. Then there are immitation of Bollywood in the form of Tamil's Tollywood, Kerala's Kollywood, Lahore's Lollywood.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic/Devanagari scripts</span></h2>
<p>Editors Elyaqim and BernardM have been adding Arabic and Devanagari script versions of actors' names in various actor articles. Elyaqim prefers to do Arabic, as he doesn't know Devanagari, and BernardM prefers to do Devanagari.</p>
<p>I'm stuck in the middle, myself, and dithering. I would prefer to see neither A nor D scripts, as using one or the other seems like a political choice. If we're going to have them, we should probably have both. But then ... I've noticed a trend for Bollywood film titles to be in D only, no A, in recent years.</p>
<p>Bernard M makes a good argument that, since there are so MANY systems of transliteration, it is hard to know how something is to be pronounced if you're given only the English version. However ... I'm feeling that there is usually a standard English version for actors' names, and it's the movie titles that might need elucidation.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if we could get input from a number of editors as to the best policy for Bollywood actors and movies. I would guess that this policy need only be devised for Bollywood, as the various other Indian languages are all written in Devanagari -- right? Let's leave out Gurmukhi, I don't think there are any Sikh movies ... are there? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:34, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No opinion, one question ... is it Arabic or Urdu script? Some of the movies I saw had title pages including both English, Urdu and Hindi/Devnagri titles for each name, but I'm not sure if that's done in the recent ones. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 20:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I understand it, Urdu is written in Arabic script. I think a version of Arabic script as used in Iran. Dunno, I'm afraid I read neither Arabic, Persian, or Urdu. Nor Hindi.

<dd>Most movie titles are written in both English and Devanagari -- and, thinking back, I have never seen a a movie title wirtten in Arabic, so ... about the discussion if names should be written in Arabic, I don`t know -- as long as nobody gets offended -- but I think Devanagari would be useful, especially since the transliteration isn`t always clear. (Is it Zhayed Khan or Zayed Khan? Is it Shahrukh Khan or Sharukh Khan? I've seen both versions.) But if there are concerns about people getting offended or discriminated ... we should just stick to English. I hope I was helpful.^^ --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch">Plumcouch</a> 22:13, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said above, my <i>impression</i> is that the older the movie is, the more likely it is to have Arabic/Urdu script in the titles and credits -- unless it's a Hindu mythological. But I could be wrong. I didn't grow up watching old Bollywood movies on TV ... <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:29, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, let me explain clearly my opinion. Even when they're everywhere the same, for various reasons, English transliterations (nearly) always suck a lot, from a linguistic point of view. But we have to use them since it's English Wikipedia, I agree. Having only English transliteration is a serious lack of informations. So if we want to know the true name of a hindi film or actor, we need a script that renders Hindi correctly. Two scripts are made for that&#160;: Devanagari and Urdu. I use Devanagari only because I don't know Urdu script at all, but having Urdu script as well is no problem to me. We can't add both each time we edit a Bollywood related article because Elyaqim and I have only half of the knowledge, and it would require us to be perfectly synchronized, which isn't possible. So one musn't see political issues when only one these two scripts is given. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernardM_74fa.html" title="User:BernardM">BernardM</a> 00:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Urdu script</a> to precisely three articles: <a href="../../../a/a/m/Aamir_Khan_46aa.html" title="Aamir Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_Khan_1a80.html" title="Salman Khan">Salman Khan</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahrukh_Khan_0610.html" title="Shahrukh Khan">Shahrukh Khan</a>. (See those pages' discussion pages, as well as my, Zora's and BernardM's discussion pages, for more information.) I was able to do so because their names are completely <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a> in origin and thus I knew how they are spelled.</dd>

<dd>The problem, as I see it, is that if we use Urdu ONLY for names of Urdu origin, it's like putting a sticker up that says "Muslim". Given the political situation in South Asia, this could be difficult. It also goes against the usual Bollywood policy, which is NOT to make a big deal out of Hindu/Muslim divisions. Even anti-Pakistani films like <i>Border</i> and <i>Gadar</i> make the usual bows in the direction of "Of course India loves its Muslims". I dunno how to deal with this. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thus far, I think people feel the addition of Devanāgarī and Urdu scripts to be benign rather than inflammatory. However, not only is it impossible for BernardM and I to work in such unnecessary synchronization, the Urdu names deserve a Pakistani or Indian Muslim Wikipedian's attention.</dd>

<p>I don't see any reason why Urdu should be added to Indian names. Outside the Muslim community in India, Urdu is read (the script) by an insignificant minority.

<dd>One question again, I saw Urdu titles, actor names along with Hindi/English in some late eighties/early nineties movies, (an example would be "Quyamat se Qyamat Tak". But I watched a version for International audience, so that may be the reason. What about the titles as seen in movie theatres in India? Do their titles/posters/names have such multi-language versions? Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:05, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ostensibly, I agree with Nichalp. Urdu is not relevent in every article. It is relevent and sufficient to be in the articles of people with Near Eastern names or a Muslim background. However, it was Zora who insisted unilaterally that it was unacceptable to have one without the other, saying <i>every</i> article should have both and trying to create an unrealistic situation wherein BernardM and I synchronize our schedules to revise all the articles simultaneously to ensure no article has one script without the other for long. Everything was peaceful, and BernardM and I were going about our business unaware of one another, until Zora stepped in and censored articles, created a controversy where there was none and claimed the presence of the scripts (particularly the Urdu) would offend others. Truth be told, I do not think anyone else has been "offended" by it.</dd>

<dd>Zora is spending a lot of time creating conflict while claiming to <i>avoid</i> some other <i>impending</i> conflict between Hindus and Muslims on Wikipedia. (It appears quite alarmist and reactionary, and thus biased, to me.) Wikipedia is not a Bollywood movie, and what percentage of movies present their titles in which scripts is not terribly relevent either. I think supplying the appropriate Urdu or Devanāgarī scripts as editors have the time, inclination and knowledge should continue as it has been doing, but without molestation, and see how reasonable Wikipedians react afterward. I feel that is a better solution than censoring relevent work already done in the name of <i>avoiding</i> offense. <a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElyaqim_032f.html" title="User:Elyaqim">Elyaqim</a> 07:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bollywood movies are released with English and Hindi titles. Since I come from Bollywood's locale, I am very sure of this. However, the titles may be changed depending on the screening location for obvious reasons. In UP, Hindi/Urdu would be common; in Tamil Nadu, Tamil and English would be common; in <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizoram.html" title="Mizoram">Mizoram</a>, (if allowed) is likely to be in English. Urdu is <b>not</b> the <i>lingua franca</i> of Bollywood. All Bollywood movies are released in Hindi only. There's no issue of religion here, it boils down to the location.

<p>I have not read the whole trail, but here are some basic points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script is not Arabic, but Urdu--Farsi, if you want.</li>
<li>Why is there a problem with some names having only Devnagri and some both Urdu and Devnagri? Would it be inappropriate to have, say, <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Sharif_7d60.html" title="Omar Sharif">Omar Sharif</a>'s name spelled in Arabic and not other <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> stars? Or have the original Russian or Italian versions of names of people who have simplified their names in Hollywood?</li>

<dd>The reason I'm worried about giving some actor names Urdu glosses and others not is that it's pointing up the ethnic/religious origins of the actors in a way that I'm not sure that they, or anyone in Bollywood, would like. It's like putting stars on Jews, for me. Bollywood has always had a large Muslim contingent, and they have always come down on the side of NOT stressing ethnic/religious differences, preaching tolerance, etc. This is not anti-Urdu discrimination on my part -- I think IFaqeer knows that that's not it -- it's worry about possible effects on/reactions of the PEOPLE involved. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:45, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>A lot of the writers and other artists that gave, and continue to give, Bollywood its material came and come from the Urdu literary tradition and culture (there is one in India, you know) and that was partly why, till about the 80s or so, <i><b>every</b></i> Bombay (it was then called Bombay)-based movie had credits in all three scripts. It is only in the last decade or two that that has become less common. And yes, I agree it has become less common now. But the point is that Urdu (the script and the language) are a living and integral part of the "Bollywood" mix.</li>

<dd>Aren't there also categories on Wikipedia specifically to identify Jews in Hollywood, as well as Puerto Ricans, Asians etc.? These were always out of pride in different ethnic and religious communities, not racist coding of articles.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, Zora, we have heard your point of view plenty of times already. Hindu, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist and (possibly) Sikh and Christian have all participated in this discussion here and we all seem to more or less agree that there is nothing inherently "provocative" or "offensive" about the use of these scripts, even if one is used without the other. Give it up. Please stop trying to portray the genteel discussion on this page as if it were a whirlwind of controversy. ("I feel like I'm walking through a minefield. Please help us achieve a peaceful consensus on this." "I'm caught right in the middle of you guys.") I know you are concerned about us, but the very ethnic communities you feel obliged to "protect" by eradicating Urdu and Hindi from Bollywood articles are the very same ones who disagree with your censoring crusade. Please stop portraying yourself as the final arbiter of propriety here on Wikipedia, like telling people they need to convince you of their opinions or face censorship. Please stop trying to adjudicate unrealistic (and frequently contradictory) "solutions" designed only to appease your own opinions. (Like: <i>Every</i> Bollywood article must be updated to include both scripts. BernardM and I must be the ones to do it, and we must synchronize our schedules to ensure it’s done almost simultaneously. We should contact the publicists of movie stars to ask what they prefer.) Please stop throwing inaccurate conspiracy theories at us. (Like: I am "some BJP anti-Muslim activist." BernardM and I are the same person, and we are coding articles to identify Muslims. Saying BernardM is a false identity by misquoting him as saying "this is the name I use when ....") Everything was fine until you set up a roadblock with your party of one, and starting censoring articles and making demands. <a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElyaqim_032f.html" title="User:Elyaqim">Elyaqim</a> 23:51, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Y'know, Elyaqim, if I just wanted to WIN, or dominate, I wouldn't have invited the people I did to comment -- including IFaqeer, who contributes to Urdu poetry blogs. Don't get angry at me for arguing for my point of view. Please don't get angry at me for making an honest mistake, thinking that you and BernardM might be the same person. It was just weird, both of you starting to add scripts at the same time. If I'm being difficult, it's because I want to be fair to people who might not be here to bring up their POVs. If an Indian Muslim could assure me that there's no problem, I'd stop worrying. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:03, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be best to have both, but we don't have to delete contributions of only one version or the other. Personally, I have nothing against Devanagari script, and I think every Bollywood actor should have their name provided in Devanagari. It also seems noncontroversial to add Urdu/<a href="../../../n/a/s/Nastaliq.html" title="Nastaliq">Nastaliq</a> script to Muslim actors' articles (since it's apparently not perceived as stigmatization, and people from the region are likely to be aware of who's a Muslim anyway, based on names alone). Personally, I think it would be nice to also have Urdu script for non-Muslim actors' names as well, just so I (and millions of other users unfamiliar with Devanagari) could read them and get a more accurate sense of how to pronounce them. (If someone wanted to, I also wouldn't object to someone adding e.g. Tamil versions of non-Tamil actors' names; it's an official Indian language, no one's eyes will explode if they see it, and it makes Wikipedia more useful for those users). However, none of these versions needs to be deleted, and it's not an explosive enough situation that we need to wait for coordination; if an article has one and not the other, then eventually someone will come along to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>In summary, I propose we agree on these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add what you know</li>
<li>Delete or correct what is clearly wrong</li>
<li>Don't delete what is not wrong</li>
<li>Neither Urdu nor Devanagari script is wrong for the names of Bollywood actors or films</li>
</ul>

<p>It stinks that I came in so late on this discussion, but I'm somewhat glad as well for obvious reasons. In any case I just wanted to let BernardM and Elyaqim know I'm willing to help. I don't know how my skills compare to yours, but I know both Devanāgarī and Nasta'līq (or the Perso-Arabic Nas<u>kh</u> that unicode supports). Might I add that even standard Hindī and Urdū transliteration differs slightly, i.e. Hindī <i>ai</i> = Urdū <i>ae</i>. How about arguing over that?! lol. When using academic conventions (Rupert Snell, R.S. MacGregor, etc.) or itrans there shouldn't be much problem I would think.

<dd>No Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam are all different scripts - though Tamil and Malayalam are similar to each other as are Telugu and Kannada. Just to preëmpt anything, yes there are special Devanāgarī characters to write தமிழ் (thamizh, Tamil), but this is actually probably more of a political problem than the other considering the resistance to Hindī in Tamil Nadu by some. Besides, nobody writes Tamil in Devanāgarī. The special characters are for writing loan words from Dravidian langs. <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 07:59, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Movie poster</span></h2>
<p>A new editor recently changed the poster at the top of the article. We used to have Deewar, which seemed to be OK with everyone -- that's a classic Amitabh film. Wingzero replaced this with a poster for Dhoom, which I didn't like at all. It could be any Hollywood biker movie, if you just go by the picture. I replaced that with Devdas.</p>
<p>We could go round on this for ages. Would it be OK to just say, well, leave the poster up for a few days and then change to another? That way everyone would get a chance to put up his/her favorite poster. I'd change back to the Dhoom poster if I thought it was going to be just temporary.</p>
<p>If we're going to have just one poster up there, then perhaps there should be some community discussion about which one to use. We only have a few thousand choices &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:35, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

So, either the actors from all eras should be mentioned, or the bloated section highlighting the current box office favorites need to be summarized. Thanks.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed Bollycat link and write up</span></h2>
<p>The Bollycat link, a web site cataloguing alleged Bollywood copies of HW films(called Bollycats) and the write up pertaining to it was removed after reviewing the web site and deeming it very unprofessional and malicious. There is a lot disinformation and racial based vitriol posted on the site. This is not an attempt to cover-up plagiarism in Bollywood, as I concede that this indeed does happen and I would personally like to see the culprits made accountable for it. While Bollycat/com does include genuine cases of plagiarism(e.g. <i>Dushman</i> as <i>Eye for an Eye</i> and <i>Kaante</i> as <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>) there are many that are not and the descriptions given to justify them are very vague and short(a few lines) In some cases the descriptions given are so generic that they could apply to anything e.g.</p>
<p>Main Hoon Na as Never Been Kissed</p>
<p>Explanation: A person goes back to school undercover as part of his/her job. And then things get complicated. Here's a BollyCat style credit role for "Main Hoon Na" (I'm here for you)...</p>
<p>Shree 420 as Citizen Kane</p>
<p>Explanation: Both movies follow a similar plot line of a young man's journey to the top, all the while alienting himself from those that love him and manipulating everyone else.</p>
<p>Mother India as The Good Earth</p>
<p>Explanation: So as they say, "Mother India" (no need to translate this title!) had "shades" of Pearl S Buck's classic, The Good Earth.</p>
<p>Lagaan as Victory:</p>
<p>Explanation: Kashif writes that Lagaan has the "same story and same feel of Sly Stallone movie 'Victory'." Both follow a match between two sides: the oppressors and the oppressed. "Lagaan" follows a cricket match and how the local Indian villagers learn to play a totally foreign sport while in "Victory" French POWs scheme to escape from an Axis prison using their Soccer match with a Naxi team as a cover. Pankaz notes that Lagaan is "very highly inspired, with added masala of cricket."</p>
<p>Those who have seen any of these will know how ridiculous these allegations are:</p>
<p>Visitors to the web site often leave comments outraged at the numerous false claims made on this site.</p>
<p>In the FAQ section on Bollycat reasons, the reasons given for the short and vague descriptions is that they do not have time to do indepth research. As the claims they are making on their web site are rather serious, even slanderous, admiting they do not research their claims shows complete irresponsibility, disregard and lack of respect. Indeed, the owners of the site do lack respect as they state in their FAQ section, "We do not like most Bollywood films. They suck. Big time"</p>
<p>You would think if they do not like Bollywood, why do they have a website dedicated to it? Obviously the purpose of the website is to slander Bollywood and it's fans and because of all of this I have removed the link as it would be offensive to most Bollywood fans and it's highly propaganized and inaccurate for research purposes.</p>

Unfortunately, Bollycat, which I hoped would have listed genuine cases, has too many egregiously wrong cases and that has more to do with it's anti Bollywood politics and I think it is unacceptable. In fact, I was going through most of it's entries last night, and I found more wrong than right cases, and in some instances even when a genuine "bollycat" has been identified it has been linked with the wrong Hollywood film e.g. the film <i>Ek Ladka Ek Ladki</i> which has been known to be a frame-to-frame remake of <i>Overboard</i> is linked to <i>Housesitter</i>; <i>Qayamat</i>, which most Bollywood fans know to be a ripp off from <i>The Rock</i> is linked to <i>Cape Fear</i> It seems the owners of this site do not watch these films themselves or pass of the slightest of resemblance or inspirations as a copy. In some cases even if the films tackle similar themes, the copy label falls. So as this site is very propaganized and even offensive, I don't think it has any place on a site like Wikipedia, which I respect immensely for it's informative and neutral content.</dd>

<dd>P.S I did not actually know I could edit the articles myself. I was initially going to lodge a complaint with Wikipedia, but then realised I could edit it. So I edited it anonymously, but felt it would be wrong not to justify the edits, so I registered an account only to do so. Hopefully, if I get any free time, I will add something to this AMAZING article in the future. You people have done a brilliant job with it. Hats offf to you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why Bollycat.com is NOT slanderous.</span></h2>
<p>You have taken a handful of examples and presented them as a sample for the entire website. What about the hundreds of others that anyone with a common sense can judge as being clear acts of plagiarism? I can understand your bias towards anything anti-Bollywood, but please just try to see the relativism here. Two of the later, Mother India and Shree 420 have been discussed over the years in the Indian press as being inspired from Hollywood. As for the other two movies, they are relatively new and many a references exist on the web from mainstream Indian newspapers about speculations of these movies containing, at least in part, plagiarized content.</p>
<p>I believe that if a section on "Accusations of Plagiarisms" can exist on this page, it really needs a reference to this website. Of course in case of Bollycat these accusations are user submitted and sometimes perhaps a bit far-fethcing. But there is no other website out there that even bothers to create such a list.</p>
<p>But if your judgement is clouded by your blind love for Bollywood, then please go ahead and do as you please. Oh and you fail to justify in your writeup how the music website can continue to be listed? May be your forgot to mention that that Bollycat is the creation of a Pakistani, and perhaps this had the most influence on your decision to protest the inclusion of Bollycat in a document that would be used as a reference for Bollywood. --<a href="../../../h/2/d/User%7EH2d2_a7c5.html" title="User:H2d2">H2d2</a> 18:44, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that the nationality of the webmaster had anything to do with it. Sonny didn't mention it (perhaps he didn't know) and I certainly didn't know it. I don't care if the webmaster is Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Japanese, or Swiss -- I'm a foreigner, not a South Asian. Sonny brought up some good examples of bad entries and I had to agree that Wikipedia shouldn't link to a site where any suspicion, ridiculous or not, is allowed to stay up. I probably didn't do MY job as an editor because I didn't check out the site myself. It's not a blind love of Bollywood to demand accuracy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The music site seems to me to be different in that I've checked it out myself, it's been recommended by numerous people (including my gurus on rec.arts.movies.local.indian), and best of all, it has sound clips so that users can make up their own minds as to resemblances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's possible that the music site should be demoted to the external links section, rather than featured. It's also possible that it too is wildly inaccurate. That hasn't been my impression, but then I've only sampled a tiny bit of the site. If other people say that it's inaccurate, then it should be removed. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:09, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your concerns H2d2. I would like to first make it clear to you that the site owner being Pakistani, Japanese, French, British, American or whatever is completely irrelavent to me and had absolutely no bearing on my decision whatsoever, in fact I didn't even know he/she was Pakistani. So, please, do not bring race into this, I'm sure you know that most Pakistani's are Bollywood fans anyway and even they could find this site offensive and inaccurate. What is relavent to me is the content, and because the content is highly propaganized, sometimes offensive and inaccurate and not suitable for research, I decided to remove the link. I did not feel the same about the film music web site, which at least gives the sound clips for comparison for vistors to make their own judgements, hence why I did not edit it. I only justified what I edited. If you would note, I also left the initial paragraph discussing Plagiarism alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There can be no relativism in matters of Plagiarism or copyright violation both of which are legal matters and felonies. If something is claimed to be <i>Plagiarised</i>, it is making a claim that somebody has stolen somebody elses original work and is claiming it as their own. While saying something has violated the copyright of something, is claiming that content has been extracted from somebody else's work without permission. All claims must be proven as either true or false. These are very serious claims and cannot be made casually. In fact, I am not very well versed in Internet law, but I wonder if bollycat.com could face charges for slander and defamation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As per copyrights law for screenwriters, at least in the US and UK guild, concepts/ideas cannot be copyrighted, only a screenplay or treatment can. Bollycat.com claims plagiarism on just some concepts/ideas resemblances, not proof. In some cases it claims plagiarism on just it's own speculations. I will give examples of both cases:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Claims of plagiarism made on speculation:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>The Burning Train as The Towering Inferno</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Explanation: Most likely the makers of this BollyCat found the word 'inferno' too hard for their target audiences to comprehend, but they still stuck with the language, calling their copy, "The Burning Train". How original?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because the tallest skyscraper being built in India would have been unimaginable and since the country actually does have the world's largest rail network, replacing the "Glass Tower" to India's fatest train, aptly named the "Super Express", really made sense in the Bollywood version. The rest of the storyline remained the same: instead of each floor catching fire and the protagonist rescuing people and moving them from floor to floor, we have train compartment to train compartment. And his sidekick helps from the outside, becoming a railways engineer instead of the firefighter of the original.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, the model train getting burnt in the end is laughable at best.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>This explanation is ludicrous and most of it is an ad-hominem against Indians(very inappropirate) The Burning Train(I saw it very recently) is about a new train(the super express) being built and then going on it's first journey. A jealous engineer sabotages the train by taking out it's breaks and planting a time bomb in the engine room. Later, there is a gas leak and an explosion and the train catches fire. The rest is your quintessential disaster movie of the people fighting for their life and rescue efforts made to save them. The towering inferno is about people trapped in a skyscraper with raging fires.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is this one of those other hundreds that anyone with common sense can identify as plagiarism, H2D2?</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Claims of plagiarism based on resemblance:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai as Sleepless in Seattle:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Explanation: Similar plot lines, a widower who needs a new wife according to those around him. A young kid who wants a mom, and goes to great lengths (like leaving home and going to look for the girl so he/she can hook 'em up) to get her. And then there's the thing about one of the characters going on national T.V. (radio in the original) to find another.b]</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The resemblance is that a 'young kid' goes to find her widowed father a woman and thus the copy label falls. A simple IMDB plot summary of both films will speak volumes:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</b></dd>
<dd>Anjali Sharma (Kajol)is a tomboy, and is very friendly with the local casanova Rahul Khanna (Shahrukh Khan). She thinks that Rahul will eventually fall in love and marry her. Things seem to be going according to plan, then Tina Malhotra (Rani Mukherji) enters their lives, and Rahul falls head-over-heels in love with her, and marries her. This breaks Anjali's heart and she leaves to go and settle far away. The marriage of Rahul and Tina results in the birth of baby Anjali (Sana Saeed), and due to complications following the birth, Tina loses a lot of blood and passes away, leaving Rahul devastated. Anjali Khanna grows up, and finds out that her mom had left her some letters to read, and she does so, and finds out that her dad may have been in love with Anjali instead without realizing it. She then makes attempts to make both of them meet again. She does locate Anjali, only to find out that she is to marry Aman Mehra (Salman Khan) shortly, and Rahul and the heartbreak she suffered is history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Sleepless in Seattle</b></dd>
<dd>After his wife died, Sam Baldwin did not think about other women. His 8-year old son Jonah thinks that his father needs a woman in order to get his life back in order and calls in on a nation-wide radio-show. The voice and story of Sam is heard by hundreds of women, including Annie Reed, who is about to marry her fiancé Walter soon. She can't find a rest until she really knows for sure that Sam Baldwin is not the one person for her. Thus, Annie travels to Seattle, where Sam and Jonah live, and there decides that Sam is not the one. The letter she never sent was posted by a friend of Annie, and therefore Jonah, who feels that she's the one for his dad, already booked a flight to New York in order to meet her on the roof of the Empire State building, just like in "An Affair to Remember". Of course, his father follows him instantly...</dd>

<p>I believe that Harprit is the editor who also uses anon IPs to attack the Urdu and Hindi articles, and has now expanded into the Bollywood article. He believes -- against the consensus of all linguists -- that Urdu and Hindi are two separate languages that just happen to have absorbed some vocabulary from each other. In other words, the Partition didn't just happen in 1947, it has always been there. (We have always been at war with Oceania.) I hope that all the other Bollywood editors will help do whatever reverting is necessary to keep the article scientifically valid. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:39, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I moved the history section to the end, and rewrote it. It was both inaccurate and ungrammatical. It's still sketchy, could use work.</p>
<p>Someone had added, to the list of Bollywood film clans, "The Other Khans" -- all the actors with the last name Khan. Sorry, that isn't a film clan unless they're related to each other!</p>
<p>I put the plagiarism links in their own section and added a caveat to the Bollycat listing. I don't want it there, really, but I'm not sure that I want to play revert war with H2d2, who's defending what I'm guessing is "his" site tooth and nail. If it is going to be there, link-clickers should know that the site has been criticized as inaccurate. H2d2 can decide whether he wants the link dropped entirely, or whether he wants it there with the caveat. I don't want Wikipedia to go on record as endorsing a site that puts up anonymous denunciations of dubious value.

<dd>Hi Zora, I don't think the criticism will make any difference to H2D2 as the main objective remains the same, publicity. Moreover, readers will find it questionable citing the reference anyway if it's a dubious site. It's becoming apparent that H2D2 is using wikipedia as a promotional tool for bollycat.com and I think that undermines the collective effort of those who've created this article for research purposes. Succumbing to H2D2 wishes sends the wrong message to others. I hope you reconsider. I don't want to edit it out myself and undermine your revision, but I don't want such a malicious, slanderous and dubious site linked from a respectable site like wikipedia. If we keep this one, it gives the green light to others with malintentions and wishes of having their own sites linked, no matter how shorn of merit they are. The only purpose I can see of linking a website here is as a resource to readers, so it is our responsibility we give them accurate information. Sunny.S 15:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Encyclopedia's are not holy books without any bias. What you or even the majority of Bollywood fans decide is not the entire truth, although it might end up in places like Wikipedia. So if what you think can be allowed here, a link to an extensive reference to what others things is rapant in Bollywood is relevant too. I'm not part of a gang or a conspiracy out there to defame Bollywood. I'm just a fan who believes there are things, important things, that we ignore. Like plagiarism. As far as the site itself is concerned, if it comes out as a Bollywood Haters Club, I frankly don't care. What I care is that it provides a long list of movies and more than often accurate descriptions of script and story plagiarism in Bollywood. Wish you could deal with that...</dd>

<p>H2d2, I <i>can</i> deal with the fact that Bollywood plagiarizes with abandon. I know that it lifts songs, plots, even entire scenes. (Akele Hum Akele Tum as a remake of Kramer vs. Kramer, complete with a "dad messes up cooking eggs" scene.) The problem with Bollycat is that it includes completely <i>unjustified</i> allegations, based on nothing more than a casual similarity. It also does not distinguish between scene-by-scene plagiarism, and the opportunistic exploitation of a general idea. I just got back from the movie theatre, where I watched Serenity, and also a bunch of trailers. One of them was for a movie that was a transparent knockoff of the Trinity character from The Matrix. I wouldn't call that plagiarism -- it's opportunistic exploitation. It's not necessarily bad, either -- people can make imitative films that are a heck of a lot better than what they're imitating. Can, but often don't.</p>
<p>If you want your site to really rate a mention on Wikipedia, institute some quality control. One method that I've suggested is to allow viewers to vote on the accuracy of allegations. Or take a more judicious view yourself. Anything that screens out inaccurate claims of plagiarism. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:57, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's say both Britannica and Encarta team up and launch an ad campaign against Wikipedia. Denouncing it's use in Academia due to the very simple fact any one can go in here and put whatever they think of something. Wouldn't that be very similar to your point against Bollycat? I for one know that there are many more money submitted to Bollycat than approved. (Again, I've told you before that it's not my site, but I do contribute there). There's a pending cases page, and you can see there that people have made much more ridiculuous assumptions to link movies that the ones that you are most annoyed with, like KKHH. The whole point of that site I think is to create a list of what people believe to be plagiarism, yes that includes accepting others' imaginative points of view, but that's part of deal. Besides, let's say Wikipedia implements such a rating system... what rating do you think the article on 'Carl Rove' would get???</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>I added the NPOV tag. I'm not sure if this really counts as POV or if the article just needs cleanup. An example of this is: "Indian audiences expect full value for their money, with a good entertainer generally referred to as paisa vasool, (literally, "money's worth"). There has even been a quirky caper chick-flick - a rarity in this male-dominated industry -called Paisa Vasool. Songs and dances, love triangles, comedy and dare-devil thrills—all are mixed up in a three-hour-long extravaganza with an intermission."</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm OK with removing the quirky chick-flick bit. It doesn't really add to the para. As for the general tone of this article, and other Bollywood articles -- it's a constant struggle between stiff academic language and fans who write just like their favorite movie columnists, all gush and hype. Various people have decided to "tone down" various articles and as soon as they finish, fans ratchet up the language again. IMHO, the only sustainable position is one somewhere in between dry and gush.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I don't think it's an NPOV issue. It's a language register issue. If you're OK with it, I think we can remove the tag.</dd>

<dd>It's a specific set of Urdu words commonly associated with Urdu love poetry/Sufi religious poetry (the categories overlap) that are often used in song lyrics. Zindagi, dil, ishq, mohabbat ... all words of Persian origin. The other set of references commonly used (hey, probably should be mentioned) is Krishna, Radha, gopi, devotee, etc., which is a Hindu mix of love poetry/religious poetry. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:47, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Bollywood has gained popularity throughout the world even in non-Hindi speaking countries. Besides the hassle of using subtitles, people are often intrigued by the action, music, plots, and romance displayed in the Bollywood movies.

<dl>
<dd>Um, I have never ever seen or heard anyone who said that Bollywood was British Hollywood. I have been reading books about Bollywood, reading online Indian film magazines, and participating in the discussions on the Usenet newsgroup rec.arts.movies.local.indian for years, and I've never encountered such an assertion. "Besides the hassle" is clumsy and unencyclopedic writing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:47, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some mention needs to be made of it's growing popularity outside India. Preferably with specific examples (e.g. sucessful films, total income outside India, etc.) I suppose some mention could be made of what people find attractive about it (again, with sources), but <i>action, music, plots and romance</i> covers quite abit.

Since there is a heck of a lot more to the Indian film industry than just Bollywood (though Bollywood is the biggest chunk of it), and since some of the movies that have had a large vogue outside India, like Satyagit Ray's films, aren't from Bollywood, it would be seriously misleading to put the main discussion in the Bollywood article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:23, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>(Linguists would call both Hindi and Urdu variants of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani_language.html" title="Hindustani language">Hindustani</a>. This is a politically charged debate; please see the Wikipedia articles on the various languages/dialects.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This is true; linguistics do consider them variants/dialects. And yes, it is politically charged. And seeing as the distinction between Hindi and Urdu was just refered to, these 2 sentences seem quite appropriate. Perhaps the last sentence could be changed to "the Wikipedia articles on those three topics", but I'm not sure that's necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Elements of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> are not uncommon either.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting that in a paragraph about language is quite out of place. If it's true (I'd be suprised if it wasn't), it probably ought to mentioned somewhere. For that matter, a general discussion of religion in Bollywood films might be worthwhile.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is unclear what an "element" of Hinduism is, and exactly how it features in Bollywood films. Perhaps I should make it clear that this is minefield territory. India has been riven by communal violence many times during its recent history, and any Hindu/Muslim references are immediately controversial (which is the problem with the Urdu/Hindi language labels). Bollywood itself is dominated by Muslims, many of them refugees from the Punjab and the Partition, who fled to Mumbai and made new lives in the film industry. They tend to be extremely respectful of Hindu beliefs, and many films financed, directed, and acted by Muslims feature idealized versions of Hindu worship, Hindu shrines, etc. They're equally respectful of Islam. Bollywood films tend towards a chipper, cheery "Hindu-Muslim bhai-bhai" attitude.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For an example, see the recent <i>Lagaan</i>, which features a village cricket team with Hindus, a Muslim, a Sikh, and an untouchable. As I told an Indian friend of mine, it's like the US World War II movies where stereotypical Italian-American, Irish-American, Jewish, WASP, etc. soldiers discover solidarity in the trenches.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It gets more complicated than that, however -- there are a number of films about the Partition, communal violence, Islamic terrorism, the Mumbai underworld (which has a significant Muslim component) and suchlike. There are films re flashpoint Hindu issues, like widow remarriage and caste. There is also a whole genre of Hindu mythological films (less popular these days, I think).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you see, it's all quite complex and can't be usefully summarized as "has elements of Hinduism". It's an interesting set of topics, which might deserve a number of breakout articles. I don't think we've tackled it just because it's so overwhelming. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:47, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The paragraph on plagarism</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-disputed paragraph seems far more NPOV. The little story about <a href="../../../b/a/p/Bappi_Lahiri_eff7.html" title="Bappi Lahiri">Bappi Lahiri</a> is interesting, but I'm not sure it belongs in a general article like this. If it does, it needs to be NPOVed, and not include terms like "ace-plagarist". However, the non-disputed paragraph could do with some expansion on the views of both sides for how common plagarism is, and <b>sources</b> for those views.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This has been extensively discussed, believe me. The section on plagiarism has grown, shrunk, and morphed endlessly. The problem is that it's an inherently subjective judgement. There's stuff that everyone would agree is plagiarism (Elvis' <i>Blue Suede Shoes</i> given Hindi lyrics and featured in <i>Dil</i>) and stuff that's just the usual "Hey, historicals are hot at the box office now, let's make a historical". That's one reason why the music plagiarism site is linked -- at least it gives sound clips, so you can make up your own mind as to whether it's plagiarism or not. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:47, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It covers material not covered by the existing plagarism link (which only discusses songs); however it doesn't provide the same specific detail, making it less desirable. But I don't know what other sites there are out there dealing with specific instances of alleged plagarism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Bollycat link was discussed on Sepia Mutiny (a very lively and influential desi blog) and contributors agreed that many of the supposed cases of plagiarism just <i>weren't</i>.

<dd>Well, most language is meaningless when taken too literally. If I were to say this to someone, I would chose the wording 'I have Mother'. It ties in with the previous wording, and is direct and to the point. If someone were to instead say, 'I am with mother', my first thought would be, 'What does that have to do with anything?'</dd>
<dd>The formula "I have X" to answer such a challenge is almost a set expression in English:
<ul>
<li>'I have money, power, everything I could want. What do <i>you</i> have?'</li>
<li>'I have love.'</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This wording has been used in so many novels and movies that it's easily recognizable. When you have the exchange,
<ul>
<li>I have cars, bungalows, wealth. What do <i>you</i> have?</li>
<li>I have Mother.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>this is immediately evocative of 'I have love', or 'I have my respect', 'I have integrity', 'I have honor', or a dozen other variations of this formula that can be understood to mean 'I have what matters most'. No one would ever think it means 'I have a mother and you don't'. That would be expressed by 'I have <b>a</b> mother', with no capitalization - quite an insulting response!</dd>

<p>My Hindi is minimal, but as an English-speaker I find Gurubrahma's version more colloquial and a better evocation of exactly what that exchange meant in terms of the movie. We seem to be having the usual translation argument about literalness versus effect in a second language. Often, if you want literalness you abandon the effect, and if you want the effect you can't be literal. How about we put up both versions? "Brother, mom is with me" followed by (literally, <i>brother, I have mother</i>). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:51, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And my Hindi is nonexistant! This wasn't a question of literalness, but of the English being smooth and evocative. "I have Mother" is more, I dunno, poetic? It's certainly how I would respond if someone addressed me that way. But perhaps it doesn't capture the flavor of the Hindi dialogue. I wouldn't argue for it being included just to have a literal translation; I think that's out of place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:05, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yikes. Clicking on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Indian_cinema_d1e7.html" title="History of Indian cinema">History of Indian cinema</a> takes one straight to the Bollywood page. While clicking on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_cinema_in_India_a132.html" title="History of cinema in India">History of cinema in India</a> takes one to the general <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_India_31ef.html" title="Cinema of India">Cinema of India</a> page. This semantic split is weird enough in itself, but that there's little actual history at the latter page makes it even more perverse.</p>
<p>It seems to me that these two phrasings ought to redirect to the same place, and if that place should be a subsection of anything, it should be at the general "Cinema of India" page. A general history of Indian film should not be tacked on way down towards the end of a Bollywood article. I'm sure I don't need to tell most people here that "Bollywood" and "Indian Cinema" are not synonymous - heck, Bollywood and Indian <i>commercial</i> cinema aren't even synonymous, as the separate articles on <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kollywood.html" title="Kollywood">Kollywood</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tollywood.html" title="Tollywood">Tollywood</a>, etc., make clear.</p>
<p>That aside, the history section looks like a pretty good start to my non-expert eyes, although it would be great to see it expanded considerably by knowledgable folks. All the more reason it should be in a more prominent and logical place.</p>

I've just been laboriously uploading a section on Nandita Das as well - hope people from here will bring their tools along to the latter site. But back to my poser - fame is glueing together a number of notable and otherwise non-notable names; this seems to be a global phenomenon. But fame in south asia is its own paradigm if you catch my drift. Worthy of a section? We could then have a global list of entertainers.

Historical and contemporary figures should be separated, and people slotted into reasonable categories.

<p>Harprit's edits are overwhelmingly blind reverts, as in this article. He refuses to engage in any discussion in the articles, to justify his versions, or even to make corrections when someone points out spelling errors. In some cases this has gone on for a month or more. I've told him that I will restore any reverts he makes unless he joins in a discussion to justify them and to work toward consensus. He doesn't engage in any specifically blockable behavior on a chronic basis, unless perhaps he is trolling. (It's hard for me to tell if he's sincere, a troll, or engaged in revenge reversion.) However, if the editing community as a whole finds him a nuissance, he can be blocked by concensus.

<dd>I have tried to take the parallel cinema folks OUT of Bollywood and put them in Indian cinema. I believe that "Bollywood" is usually taken to apply to mainstream commercial films, not indie or art-house films. It could be that this distinction is breaking down and that we should have a section discussing the boundaries between indie and commercial cinema in India. But if there's material on the current Bollywood page that implies that Ray was a Bollywood director, of course it should be removed. I'll take a look when I get a chance.</dd>

<p>I have generally abridged several sections to make the diction and paraphrasing shorter and standardized.</p>
<p>There are references to Pakistanis being 'more' involved in plagiarizing - REMOVED</p>
<p>Please use the words plagiarizing and bootleg instead of pirated/piracy - the usage is colloquial.</p>

<dd>I have seen the changes in toto; that is why, the edit summary reads "revert - he removed some POV and added some POV." While you have made several changes, the net effect, imo, was that some POV was removed, some was added and the quality of writing came down, strictly again, imo. Bootleg and smuggle are more colloquial than piracy. Bootleg is used more for liquor, narcotics etc. While the dvds are smuggled into Pakistan, the fact remains that they are also pirated versions. The difference is this: DVDs are smuggled into Pakistan because it is (or was) illegal to get movies through imports. However, most of the DVDs available in Pakistan are also pirated, that is, not released by the copyright holders for DVDs. On balance, piracy is more serious from Bollywood's point of view as it affects their revenues. If legit DVDs were to be smuggled into Pakistan, it wouldn't be piracy but still smuggling - yet, it would no longer be a problem of Bollywood but Pakistan's law and order problem. In your paraphrasing, some of the contextual meaning has been greatly lost. Some POV also entered, probably inadvertently, when you call the India TV show "popular" - The TRP ratings of the show and the channel are not much to write home about, the previous categorization of tabloid show seems a better description. Some grammar mistakes have also jumped in, such as, plagiarized Pakistani industry - it should be plagiarized from. A minor matter, but strictly speaking, it should be "plagiarised" as we are supposed to use British English on this article. Roshan senior did not launch his sons, just as Harivanshrai Bachchan did not launch Amitabh or Sekhar did not launch A. R. Rahman. I felt the stress was on people who made it more on their own steam rather than their parents'. Suzanne Khan is the wife of Hrithik Roshan and the daughter of Sanjay Khan of "The Sword of Tipu Sultan." On a topic like Bollywood which sees constant churn like it does, it becomes very difficult to maintain the integrity when several edits are made within a few minutes. The situation becomes complicated especially in situations like these, where all the edits are well-meaning, but some improving the quality and some reducing the same. I would like to hear from the other regular editors of this article as well about what they think about the issue. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 20:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pizza, I too would like to see a slowdown. While some of your edits have been helpful, others have been ungrammatical. It is very hard to wade through a number of small changes, accepting some, reverting others. It amounts to having to rewrite the article. I had to rewrite the plagiarism section, which I thought had been mangled, and I haven't dealt with the rest of the article. I usually don't mind rewrites when they improve the quality of the article, but in this case the effect is very mixed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">grammar - resolved issue</span></h2>
<p>Should it be "plagiarizing the Pakistani movie industry" or "plagiarizing <b>from</b> the Pakistani movie industry"??? Please comment and/or change as is acceptable after verifying the grammar. I have seen both instances elsewhere, but my gut feeling is that Wren and Martin would spin in their graves if they saw the second version!!!</p>
<p>Plagiarize is a transitive verb, in most cases. Which means that it needs a Direct Object to complete context, something that is an answer to a question ending in "what/for what", or "whom/for whom". So when I say,</p>
<p>"Many people have plagiarized <i>what</i>"?, the answer is "(the) Pakistani Industry" and not "<i>from</i> (the) Pakistani industry"</p>

<p>(To Zora!!!!)</p>
<p>The word <i>alleged</i> is important here since otherwise, we would ourselves be accused of leveling accusations of <b>plagiarism</b> against Bollywood. May be plagiarism happens, but Wikipedia is to document what ('allegedly') happens, and not actually level accusations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>PDB, I have seen arguments about how much plagiarism there is, but nobody, ever, ever, has suggested that there isn't any. Anyone who has watched more than a few Bollywood films knows dang well that there's plagiarism. It's even amusing. <i>Dil</i> steals "Blue Suede Shoes" and turns it into a campus dance number &lt;g&gt;. I don't think we have to pussyfoot with "allegations" when nobody doubts that there's plagiarism. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some places mention audiences in South Asia, some mention Indian audiences - need to stick to one reference.</p>
<p>I have combined a few sentences just for the sake a more lucid reading and proper context construction - no grammar issues, just that an encyclopedia article needs to stick to a std above plain essay writing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Don't be too sure of your writing abilities, grasshopper. The plagiarism section was carefully set up with a then/now organization, which you didn't see, and trashed. "In the past, this could be done with impunity" is anecessary organizing, orienting sentence and shouldn't have been moved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Ideas, plot lines, tunes, or riffs" has a better rhythm than your "themes, tunes or <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff.html" title="Riff">riffs</a>, or even entire plot lines" -- try saying them both out loud. Also, your use of "or" in two places, at two levels of meaning, is inelegant and confusing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You destroyed the parallelism of "close at hand" and "far away", leaving the first clause hanging.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You added your own POV when you said that audiences are more familiar with Western media because of cable TV. I understand that this is a big part of it, but cheap VCDs, more Hollywood films in multiplexes, influence of large diasporic community, etc., surely have something to do with it too. Rather than include that whole list, it would be better to just leave out the cable TV bit you added.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do I have to pick apart every one of your edits? I hope not. One of them was good -- combining the last two sentences in my rewriting gives a better flow.</dd>

<dd>I'm not against people editing my prose. I welcome it, when the editor is skilled. Users Autumnleaf (from New Delhi), IFaqeer, and Mustafaa have been wonderful at fixing my prose. But I don't think you have that level of skill, PDB. In many cases you make things worse rather than better. I hate to be so blunt, but I'm not sure that anything else will have an effect. Until you're a better copyeditor, it would be a better use of your time and energy if you were to visit the Indian cinema projects page, look at the list of articles to be created, and start work researching and writing from scratch. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont think the <i>India's Most Wanted</i> is a tabloid (<i>A newspaper of small format giving the news in condensed form, usually with illustrated, often sensational material.</i>).

<p>First rule of writing an encyclopediac article: Do not level accusations, even implied. Never mind if Bollywood plagiarizes, copies or even trashes other people's work. But Wikipedia has no business passing judgement - specifically, by omitting the word 'alleged' you are jumping into the bandwagon, so to speak and leveling an accusation, albeit implicitly, which is not what an encyclopedia is all about. So if there is a scent of wrong doing in the actions of the subject about whom the article is being written, you ALWAYS use the word 'alleged' - its common sense, polite and saves you from something called 'libel' - ever heard of that word??</p>
<p>IMW was also a program on TV - not just a paper. Never mind their antecedents or intentions - we need to atleast stick to a minimal decorum of not 'judging' someone - atleast the word 'popular' sheds some positive light - but the word 'tabloid' borders on crassness.</p>
<p>I may agree with you on cable TV, but mentioning the dynamics of the transformation of Indian audience needs some credit - just mentioning the changing tastes of Indian audience is incomplete.</p>

<p>Anon, it's not a good idea to go around changing US to UK spelling, and vice-versa. Both spellings are OK, and we haven't standardized. Basically, we usually leave things as the original author wrote them. Otherwise it leads to edit wars between US and UK editors.</p>
<p>Also, I reverted your edits in the Hollywood-Bollywood sentence. I felt that you had just made the sentence more stilted and harder to read. Now this is a matter of taste. We try to sound encyclopedic but not academic here, and it's a hard balance to attain. Still, I don't think the previous version was bad, just not as ornate as you prefer.</p>

<p>I'd added some links previously to a couple of different organizations offering Bollywood style dance classes. It wasn't for commercial purposes, but rather to illustrate the point that Bollywood films and the trademark songs &amp; dances are becoming very much a part of mainstream pop culture outside of South Asia.</p>
<p>a simple web search will turn over so many different options for fans who seek to learn the style of Bollywood dancing, or who are just enthusiastic about the song and dance sequences. I felt it was a great addition to the wiki, elaborating that Bollywood is no longer an underground or cult phenomena in the west, but is trending into a large wave, both in music and movies, and western pop culture. For example, the upcoming launch of the broadway show "Bombay Dreams" on tour in the US...</p>
<p>There are some wonderful resources available, and these sites don't just stop at dance classes, they are full of lots of information about the genre and style:</p>

<p>Bharatveer, all I need to do is pull down a few DVDS from the shelf. My one mythological (<i>Jai Santoshi Maa</i>) lacks Urdu titles. A couple of films I sampled (Shri 420, Rangeela) are all in Roman lettering. The other seven I checked are mainly in English, but also have the main title of the film in Devanagari and Urdu scripts. They range from 1959 (Kagaaz Ke Phool) to 1990 (Agneepath).</p>

<p>The title of a film, in Hindustani, is pronounced the same whether it is written in Devanagari or Arabic/Persian/Urdu script. It's the same word, different scripts. It is HARD to learn to read a different script. It was much easier for me to learn Tongan or French than it was to learn the tiny bit of Japanese I know, which required learning to read all over again. That is the point of giving the title in both scripts. To make it easy for everyone. You guys seem to think that Urdu and Hindi are different languages -- they aren't. They're different registers of the same language, with vocabulary skewed towards either Sanskrit or Arabic/Persian. Look at the Wikipedia articles on Hindi, Urdu, and Hindustani. Bollywood films are consciously aimed at the street version of Hindustani, which is the same however it is written.</p>

<p>to be fair, I get lots of google hits for the Hindi spelling, but none for the Urdu one. Still, the "fact" template is mistaken here, since it is not the spelling that is disputed, as far as I gather, but the relevance of Urdu to the concept. This is a content dispute (and I have no opinion here), not an accuracy dispute. Compare <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>: it is disputed whether the Turkish variant of the name should be given, it is not the correctness of the Turkish spelling that is under discussion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User;Gizza, Are you sure that the language of that film (as per Certification) is URDU.?? Films which depict the life of nawabs, mughals etc etc will certainly have more urdu words. But they are exceptions and not a general rule.If Urdu can be included, then why not Punjabi and Marathi, telugu&#160;?-<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 05:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The language on the censor certificate is absolutely irrelevant to linguistic reality. The 1960 censor certificate for Mughal-E-Azam lists the language as Urdu. For the 2004 colorized re-release, the certificate lists the language as Hindi. Yet not one word in the film has changed. It remains in reality a mix of mostly formal Urdu and some conversational Hindustani. Who knows or cares why they changed the certificate? Encyclopedias exist to record facts, not the bureaucratic effluvia of the Indian censorship regime.</dd>
<dd>There is no purpose in standardising on one script or the other. The irrefutable linguistic fact of the matter is that readers of the language spoken in "Bollywood" films read one or more of the following scripts: Nagari, Urdu, and Roman. Since the article is in English, Roman is required. The other two are optional and helpful. It is wrong to remove any of these scripts. Dieresis 12:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gizza, I think you are confusing literary Urdu with everyday conversational Urdu. "Urdu" and "Hindi" speakers converse with each other all the time without the need of a translator, because conversational Hindi and Urdu are in fact the same language. It's only when dialogues veer into literary or formal realms that it becomes incomprehensible to those not educated in literary Urdu (including, of course, plenty of illiterate or otherwise uneducated Urdu speakers). Hindi, of course, has its own literary and formal registers which pose the same barriers to comprehension. The dialogue of most "Bollywood" films is written in an uncomplicated register understandable to a broad range of people. Dieresis 12:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, you're starting from the assumption that Hindi and Urdu are completely separate languages, and that a Hindi film will be unintelligible to Urdu speakers and vice-versa. That's just not the case. The film-makers don't record the dialogues twice, once in Hindi, once in Urdu. They're written, and recorded, in a language that can be understood by the man in the street (with a few bits of local slang or high-flown vocabulary inserted for color -- frex, I understand that <i>Lagaan</i> made some attempt to have Bhojpuri-flavored dialogues). The man (or woman) in the street watches the film, whether he lives in New Delhi or Karachi, and understands most or all of it.</p>
<p>If the film is dubbed into Bengali or Tamil or Malayalee, then it makes sense to have those versions of the title, for the convenience of someone who might have seen it in those languages and is looking it up on the English WP. If it isn't dubbed, then I don't think there's any need to include any extra scripts. I'm not all that knowledgeable on the non-Bollywood cinemas, so I don't know if dubbing is widespread. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first sentence of this article says <i>Bollywood (Hindi: बॉलीवुड, Urdu: بالیوڈ) is the informal name given to the popular Mumbai-based Hindi language film industry in India</i>. Yes it says HINDI language. It doesn't matter if they use poetic Urdu words or dialogues. They similarly use Punjabi songs, dances and phrases. It's the Hindi film industry. The reason why the name may be written in Urdu on DVD covers is because despite the fact that the two languages sound similar, they are written quite differently and thus it makes sense to release the same movie (so no dubbing) to two different audiences (Indian and Pakistani). <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 07:39, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That comment is entirely illogical. A commercial DVD cover is not a reliable source as an academic institution. So, please 1. Show the certificate page of the movie 2. Show how the "UPenn South Asia Center" was taken over by "Some university students". Unless you can satisfy these, I'll remove the tag.

<dd><a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> sir, many of us have provided you with references. It is also pretty obvious from the movie posters that when Indian scripts are used, both Devanagari and Perso-Arabic are given. Also keep in mind that this issue was already voted on <a href="../../../b/o/l/Talk%7EBollywood_3613.html#Arabic.2FDevanagari_scripts" title="Talk:Bollywood">here</a> with 100% of the voters choosing to include both Hindi and Urdu. In other words, it is already well established that Bollywood articles will use both Hindi and Urdu scripts. As per this discussion, please do not place any more citation tags for the Urdu script in Bollywood related articles. Respectfully, <a href="../../../a/n/u/User%7EAnupam_f67e.html" title="User:Anupam">Anupam</a><sup><a href="../../../a/n/u/User_talk%7EAnupam_5979.html" title="User talk:Anupam">Talk</a></sup> 19:52, 4 October 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Nobleeagle, the use of Bhangra/Punjabi is rather limited in Bollywood, it is used sometimes of course, but most bhangra/punjabi-like songs are in Hindi-Urdu. What I'm saying is, the use of Urdu in songs is <i>typical</i>, unlike Punjabi, which is not mentioned in the article above that I gave. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 02:17, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And what I am saying is that the use of Urdu in songs and dialogues is completely irrelevant. This is the article on the film industry, not of the movies that use Urdu or of the songs that use Urdu. The film industry is a Hindi one. Also, as I pointed out above, it is pointless to dub films in Urdu as Hindi and Urdu sound pretty much the same. Thus, the same film is sent to both Hindi and Urdu audiences. The differences in writing in Hindi and Urdu are what result in the fact that some films have both Hindi and Urdu on their film covers. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 06:24, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Hindi and Urdu are "pretty much the same," you've as much as admitted that they're the same language. A writing system does not make a language. Ataturk, in Turkey, decreed that the Arabic alphabet be abandoned and a Roman alphabet used. The change in writing systems did not mean that Turkish suddenly changed. Chinese can be written with the usual characters (of which there are several systems) or written with Roman characters (for which there are also several systems). Chinese does not change when how it is written is changed. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It appears that there's a pretty good consensus to leave Urdu script in the opening here. There is some disagreement about why it belongs there and--rightly so. This is not very clear and the question is not whether Urdu is equal to or as important as Hindi. Bharatveer, feel free to discuss this more but do not remove Urdu script until there is a massive chance in consensus. Also, your evidentiary demands are not something that can easily be met for Hindi, either. There are mixed references about what language the films are actually in. Also, you may note that if you ever study linguistics that language delineation is not always the most clear prcess and it <i>is</i> a political one as well. The point being that you get contradicting claims which are politicized and that you will not find an 'objective truth' of Hindi vs. Urdu but a multitude of interpretations. So, continue this discussion by all means but don't remove Urdu script from the films because it is related in some sense--whether it's the film's language or just because films are relased in their non-dubbed form with devanagari and nastaliq. This is no doubt something that can be falsified on a case-by-case basis. For instance--religious (Hindu) film marketing may very well not include any nastaliq. This is a problem you get with mutually intelligible languages that we will have to deal with. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 10:06, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apparently when the spammers arrive, they remove existing links and add theirs. When the spam is removed, there is nothing. I went back a few months, found the <i>non-commercial</i> links that had been there for a long time, and restored them. Gosh all fishhooks I'm tired of this fight.</p>
<p>This time I put "non-commercial" after the links, which may give the spammers a bit of a clue.
