<p>Although the word "cult" does actually have a neutral meaning, I think its meaning is somewhat weighted in todays usage. For the purpose of objectivity i think that this line " . . and in addition the cult of Lenin as a heroic leader." should be made to have a less slanted, how do you say, flavor. perhapse " .. .and in addition the adoption of Lenin as great leader."</p>

<p>From 66.124.101.229:</p>
<p><i>Since the Jews in Russia were discriminated, many of them were atracted by the non-nationalist vision of Russia after socialist revolution. Both fractions of the party had big shared of Jewish memebers. This lead to oficially <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> as the way of fight of Tsars police <a href="../../../o/k/h/Okhrana.html" title="Okhrana">Okhrana</a> against those underground organisations.</i></p>
<p><i>This led to the characterization of the Communist Revolution as a vengeful Jewish conquest of Russia in view of the murder of the royal family and the annihilation of tens of millions of ethnic Russians and Ukranians in the 1920's and 1930's.</i></p>
<p><i>The view of the communism as the Communist-Jewish ambitions were also popular in other countries especially after the communist revolution, as achieved in Hungary, under the Jew Bela Kuhn.</i></p>
<p><i>This dualistic view ( <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashism.html" title="Fashism">fashism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> ) contributed to the rise of National Socialists (<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">Nazis</a>) in Germany, and lead to defeat European democracy.</i></p>

<dd>It's a bit incorrect way to put material into the article. Sorry, but your position is biased. The level of antisemitism in Tsarist Russia is exaggerated. It was not major problem and it was not pumping the revolution. Despite your points are possible correct, and it might be a good theory for the in-depth analysis, they are not of that significance. Maybe they could belong to the "Antisemitism Influence Theory" section, but not to the main body of the article. It's just a theory, nothing more. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrbug_126b.html" title="User:Drbug">Drbug</a> 19:40, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Regarding the Jewish-Communist link, I've noted that the Soviet government itself tacitly or explicitly participated in a number of <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> over the years; not exactly something they would do if they were controlled by Zionists. Also, there was the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Autonomous_Republic_f1f6.html" title="Jewish Autonomous Republic">Jewish Autonomous Republic</a>, billed as a homeland for Jews within the Soviet framework.</p>
<p>In a larger sense, I think that the scope of this article is in danger of spiralling out of control. It's supposed to be about the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, not about the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_3bdf.html" title="History of the Soviet Union">History of the Soviet Union</a> or the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia_and_Soviet_Union_11e2.html" title="History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union">History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union</a>. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 09:24, 15 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>In the agreement with the previous remark (but without even seeing it:-), the piece below was cut out of the article as irrelevant to the topic and more than adequately replaced by the link to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia_and_Soviet_Union_11e2.html" title="History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union">History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union</a>.</li>

Indeed, the Soviet government participated in a number of <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> over the years, where police and troops either tacitly allowed or actively participated in the destruction of Jewish communities. --&gt;</dd>

<li>...not to say that the last sentense is a total bullshit:
<ul>
<li>Before Stalin there was mostly <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Civil_War_dc1c.html" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>, during which there were pogroms indeed, but by <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Army_09a3.html" title="White Army">White Army</a>, which perceived the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_b5cc.html" title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> as "Jewish-Bolshevik plot" (Hitler was way far from being original in this respect).</li>
<li>Stalin, on the other hand, was demonstratively pro-semitic for quite a long time. His assassination of Jewish "Old Bolsheviks" was only accidental to the word "Jewish" and completely determined by the word "Old". Stalin performed horrible purges of a number of other small nations, but it seems that Jews were down his list. It is argued that he planned something for them: his last days are notable by the preparation of the trial of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctors%27_plot.html" title="Doctors' plot">Doctors' plot</a>, so Stalin's death may be rightfully added to the list of Jewish national holidays as a narrow escape.</li>

<dd>I thought over this issue many times on different occasions and when editing different articles. In case you didn't notice, quite a few major countries has subsections or full articles specifically devote to jews, see e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_history_topics_baec.html" title="List of Jewish history topics">List of Jewish history topics</a> . It could seem annoying at first. But if you think that Jews lived two millenia in diaspora, without a country on which they could "concentrate" the articles of their long history, you'll understand that to cover the history of Jews, you must make branches of many and many articles. This has nothing to do neither with zionism nor with anti-Semitism. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 16:58, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Jewish Bolshevik stuff is really a side issue and belongs in the article on the history of Jews in the Soviet Union. It does not merit this much space.

<p>AndyL you have done a lot of good work here. Do you think we should have more discussion of what was at stake, tactically and ideologically, in the division between Menshiviks and Bolsheviks? I also wonder if we need to say something about the relationship (and competition) between the Party and the Soviets during the revolution -- that is, if we want to identify Bolshevism with "Marxism-Leninism." What do you and others think? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<p>May I sugest that Jews were a very important migrating group at the Rise of Lenin. It was even just as important as in the rise of Hitler! Being a party that supports Communistic or Nationalistic is not just only believing in expansionism or 'One Pure race' as it was the case in hitlers Third Reich. You have to look not only at political situation in a country, but also its economical situation. It is known that in Germany, Jews were taking an important roll in economical positions: small street marketing was the most important factor that helped the country to overcome its economical difficulities. It was the case that most of these shops were owned by the Jews.</p>
<p>Almost the same situation was noticed in Soviet Union, where street marketing was in fact the core of survival. It was only later, when the industrialisation led by Lenin started, the small marketers were sort to say pushed out of the busness. These small marketers, or at least the bigger part of it were in fact Jews.</p>
<p>So you can see that Jew played a big roll in these two countries at the time when Communism and Nationalism existed (also was felt in other countries). Dependence on these groups was a very big headacke to the extremist parites which were ment to be straong and maintaining the situation, so there was no room for dependence, and thats why the small marketing problem was braught up... which is of course connected to the Jews who owned the small markets!</p>

<p>"On July 19, the Kerensky government ordered the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote State and Revolution, which outlined his ideas for a socialist government."</p>
<p>This section is missing any context of the arrests. On July 3rd/4th there were militant demonstrations by the Petrograd working class aimed at overthrowing the Provisional Government. The Bolshevik leadership opposed it as premature, but many rank and file Bolsheviks were anxious for a revolution and fully supported it. The Bolshevik leadership ended up at the head of the demonstations trying to ensure they were non-violent. Troops loyal to the Provisional Government suppressed the demronstations violently, followed by the crackdown alluded to in the article. I propose chaning the article to this;</p>
<p>"In early July widespread discontent in Petrograd led to militant demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. The Bolshevik leadership opposed this as premature but ended up leading the demonstrations, hoping to prevent any bloodshed. They felt compeled to do this to win the trust of the workers and also in recognition of the fact that many of the Bolshevik rank and file were already organising and supporting the demonstrations. Troops loyal to the Provisional Government suppressed the demronstations violently. The following crackdown resulted in the Kerensky government ordering the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership on July 19th. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote State and Revolution, which outlined his ideas for a socialist government."</p>

<p>Does anyone feel this picture is wholly innappropriate and unnecessary? Sure, it shows some Bolsheviks but it's an awful picture and isn't even Russian!</p>
<p>Secondly, both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks spelt the name of the party Social-Democratic or RS-DRP. If you look at any publications or posters by either you'll see the hyphen. We use the hyphen for Socialist-Revolutionaries so why not Social-Democrats?</p>

<dd>On the plus side, the picture shows the most popular/famous Bolshevik leaders circa 1920. On the minus side, its highly stylized, which makes it esthetically interesting, but probably not as informative as one would expect to find in an encyclopedia. A decent photo of some Comintern or Soviet/Party Congress presidium would be certainly preferable if we could find one.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Re: "RS-DLP", it is true that both Menshevik and Bolshevik leaders sometimes used the hyphen in their letters as you can see in Lenin's collected works. However, the English translation is just "RSDLP". If you go to print.google.com and search for "RS-DLP" and then "RSDLP", you will find 4 books (all of them Lenin's works) that use the hyphen and 81 books that don't. <a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhasuerus_97b5.html" title="User:Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a> 15:26, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say it's babyish, but it does seem to be trying to prove a point, rather than being an NPOV discussion of the subject. <i>Obviously</i> Jews were disproportionately prominent at high levels in the Bolshevik movement, especially as compared to the Tsarist regime that preceded it.

<p>Lenin WAS jewish - I am from Estonia, one of many countrys wish suffered greatly from bolsheviks regime. Allmost 1/3 our people where killed or sent to Siberia 1939/40 and 1945/47. My grandfather/mother was executed in front of my 10months old father and father himself was sent to Siberia. He was able only after 1991 to reestablish is family line (it was deep in KGB arhives). So everyone new in 1918-1939 in Estonia about origin of Lenin Stalin and the rest of bolsheviks guerillas "family line" and countrys of origin - it was not a secret those days. They where ample amount of proofs about they "blood" they real names (most of bolsheviks had at least 2 names before revolution of 1917 and after) and the countrys they came from most of bolsheviks wasent even a russians they hade difficultis to speek russian. When bolseviks conquer Estonia in 1939 those books where burned and people have them sent to Siberia (but YOU cant burn all books and information about them).
