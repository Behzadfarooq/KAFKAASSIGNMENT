<p>You changed per cent to percent on Lance Armstrong, but didn't specify why. Is it because he is from the US? Cheers <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> July 5, 2005 02:23 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a good reason, since it fits the style of the rest of the article, but <i>percent</i> is more common than <i>per cent</i>, even among Queen's English publications.
<dl>
<dd>It only fits the style of the article <b>NOW</b> because you changed per cent to percent. Google doesn't agree with your assertion re percent being more common than per cent. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> July 5, 2005 23:01 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? <i>percent</i> gets 108 million hits and <i>per cent</i> gets 13 million. What was your search criteria? On the English Wikipedia, <i>per cent</i> has 4,650 hits while <i>percent</i> has 35,300. Also, all of my dictionaries show percent as the more common spelling, with my US-centric Webster's referring the reader to <i>percent</i> under the entry for <i>per cent</i>.
<dl>
<dd>Huh too! On my google search, per cent got 126,000,000 hits. Percent got 108,000,000. Must be all in the way you hold your mouth. ):- <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> July 6, 2005 00:48 (UTC)

<dd>hehe. You're searching for <i>per cent</i>, which brings up any page which has both words. You might want to try a search for <i>"per cent"</i>, which will bring up only that string...</dd>

<dd>Well, I was thinking about point 7 <i>An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance.</i> Perhaps my interpretation is too aggressive, but this article in particular doesn't assert that the band members or the band itself have accomplished anything.

<dd>Yes but it's a band, innit? (!) (Actually I found the article unintentionally funny.

<p>Bollar, what claims did Melchizedek make at the time of the RMI memo, probably none? If i remember they only had an assignment of deveopment rights, but after the memo, it was on SBS TV in Australia that they received a 50 years sovereign lease from Taongi's Iroijlaplap.</p>
<dl>
<dd>DOM had already announced their plans for Bokak, as indicated on their own site as of December 12, 1998. The RMI memo directly addresses this plan. As for the SBS broadcast, please cite the source and broadcast date. Is this a broadcast of the "interview made for DOM TV?"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>On the 4th day of September 1987, Murjel Hermios, the recognized Iroijlaplap (king or paramount chief) and owner of the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands', Ratak Chain, granted a Special Power of Attorney to Robert Moore wherein Mr. Moore as Alab, gained for 55 years, the assignable right to develop Taongi Atoll and determine its highest and best use. On May 28, 1997, Robert Moore assigned all of his rights, title and interest in Taongi; and authorized the "Dominion of Melchizedek to do every act and thing necessary to transfer unto itself said rights, title and interest, and sanction(ed) its objectives to develop, govern and administer an environmentally sound business community, investment and tax haven paradise at Taongi Atoll, ultimately styled after that of Hong Kong". According to a former DOM Minister of External Affairs for Asian Pacific, the uninhabited Taongi, located at approximately 14.35 North latitude and 169.0 East longitude is one of the most beautiful group of islands in the world. The RMI has denounced DOM's plans to move Taongi into a sovereign status under Melchizedek, yet some of the RMI's top officials have indicated a willingness to discuss the RMI officially recognizing DOM.<a href="http://http://web.archive.org/web/19981212030918/http://www.melchizedek.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://http://web.archive.org/web/19981212030918/http://www.melchizedek.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Just figured to drop you a note to let you know that the Landsat satellite does not have visible color bands as you state in all the Landsat images you insert "NASA NLT Landsat 7 (<b>Visible Color</b>)". May want to go through and correct that. 64North 18:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are right Jeannette Piccard was called not Dr. but Mme. at least in the New York Times (I don't have some of the sources you may have). I have no indication she was Swiss like the other Piccards, in case that helps. She lived in Switzerland about 7 years though. Never would have known she won this without your work. That far back all I could find after seeing your page was photographs in PDFs (no text for a search engine to find). Best wishes and thank you again. -<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanlesch_72ab.html" title="User:Susanlesch">Susanlesch</a> 21:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
