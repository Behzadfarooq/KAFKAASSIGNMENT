<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> goes to an totally superfluous disambiguation page, and <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_scout.html" title="Boy scout">Boy scout</a> comes out at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a>. I'd say: all come out here! You don't even have to merge the disambiguation list into this article since all is already here. And I have been thinking this yesterday too: I recommend a move of the whole article to Boy Scout (singular), as that is the wikipedia standard. Remember this is not about the movement (which is indeed named in plural), but on this little guy with his funny uniform and a christmas tree of badges on his arm.
<ul>
<li>You didn't check that I fixed "Boy scouts" yesterday-;)</li>
<li>Using "Boy Scouts" keeps it inline with "Cub Scouts". Made "Boy Scout" redir here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rewrite history/Foundation, to focus on the boys in the story, not the organization or the movement
<ul>
<li>tiny bit
<ul>
<li>I'd say a bit more, and leave out the words on the movement (see item one)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding more about ranks and badges, not only the top ones for all countries, but more on the principle
<ul>
<li>did some. May I suggest a bit more: remove the obscure highest ranks (and the organizations) and add some info about how to get there. I recall that there are before getting Kroonverkenner I could also earn tresses in three kinds of colours: red/white, green/yellow, gold, and a woodman whistle cord (leather) for various things. Do these still exist?
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>did some more, but can't get too specific, it's a generic article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organization is good now for the time being</li>
<li>More on the uniform (Randy, do you recall those thick corduroy shorts? Wish I had a pair still&#160;;-)
<ul>
<li>did tiny bit
<ul>
<li>Repetitively, I would hope for a little bit more.
<ul>
<li><s>like what? can't get too specific, it's a generic article</s> tried a bit even more</li>

<p>We have now several closely related articles, which must be clear and distinct. A for me very important distinction is between the movement of scouting and the type of members</p>
<ol>
<li>About the movement: <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venturing_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_718e.html" title="Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)">Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)</a>, etc</li>
<li>About the persons: <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> (sic!), <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Scout_489c.html" title="Eagle Scout">Eagle Scout</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell_a8fa.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownies_%28Girl_Guides%29_0224.html" title="Brownies (Girl Guides)">Brownie</a>, etc</li>
</ol>
<p>The article here is about a boy who is a scout: <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> (singular). Hence my recommendation for a move. And I don't recommend altering the text to make it fuzzy so it al becomes about the movement again. I much prefer a well defined subject (e.g. <a href="../../../b/-/p/B-P_House_01f9.html" title="B-P House">B-P House</a> over <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout_method.html" title="Scout method">Scout method</a>)</p>
<p>Using this directive, the history section of the article shouldn't be a problem anymore either: <i>first there were <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">military scouts</a> with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">B-P's</a> books. Boys read those military books too and used them: voila <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a>. First formal use of the term on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownsea_Island_Scout_Camp_a99f.html" title="Brownsea Island Scout Camp">Brownsea</a> I guess. After that, the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_for_Boys_053a.html" title="Scouting for Boys">new book</a> targeting boys, and a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">formal movement</a> came into being.

<dd>I don't care if it's "Boy Scout" or "Boy Scouts", but I do strongly feel it should match "Cub Scout"/"Cub Scouts". Right now that one is "Cub Scouts", so either we change both Boy and Cub Scouts or leave them both as is. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 01:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia cares: it should be &lt;singular&gt;. when designating a group of &lt;singular&gt;s. But as an article move has impact (e.g., the article must probably be copy-edited, I recommend to propose this move somewhere central. Better yet: let's seriously discuss the whole tree of scouting wikiproject articles. After my vacation, please. 06:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<p>Currently "Boy Scouts" redirects here; the term once redirected to "Boy Scouts of America". Yet some people are using the claim that this is an article "on the individual Boy Scout" to justify removing anything that suggests controversy about the Boy Scouts. This situation could be amelioriated in several ways, with two being obvious: (1) Have "Boy Scouts" go to a disambiguation page; I suspect that more people who enter that term are interested in finding specific scouting organizations than about a "Boy Scout" as such. (2) Have a line at the top pointing to the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> as an alternative; this is US-centric, so I think it's the less desirable solution. A variant would be to have a line at the top point to a page with a list of national/regional Scouting organizations (is there such a page?). <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 21:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"to justify removing anything that suggests controversy about the Boy Scouts." --presumptive and untrue, so Hogwash. The controveries article is about the BSA specifically, not Scouting associations nor the individual Scout on an international level,-but specifically about American Scouts. If this were "Boy Scouts of the BSA" it would certainly apply, but it isn't. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 22:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Hogwash"? May I note that you recently removed a simple <b>link</b> to a page itemizing the controversies. Not a discussion, simply a link in a list of links. One is supposed to assume goodwill when discussing Wikipedia editing, but you are straining my ability to do so. I have restored the link. If my claim is "Hogwash," someone is forging your signature. <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 12:02, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only thing about this one is that there are girls in it and this is an article specifically on Boy Scouts. Some may object to that; but on the other hand several Boy Scout organizations are now coed. So, I feel it's fine to use for this article. I think this is a better lead photo for the article than the previous one (I moved it to "Activities", which I feel is an excelleent spot for it).

<dd>The second paragraph of the intro does say some units are coed now and it's discussed in thr organization section and there's a link under "See also". Girl Scout, Girl Scouts, and Girl Guide all redirect to Girl Guides, which is on the Girl part of the movement. What is lacking is a girl version of this <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> article; wherein the focus is on the girl, not the movement. As for your first bullet, I'd leave it as it is; as for the second, I'd suggest some knowledgeable person start the girl equivalent of this article and fix redirects accordingly, perhaps rename Girl Guides to Girl Guiding, focusing on the movement and make Girl Scout or Girl Guide the focus of the girl.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem as I see it is that you have several categories:

<li>Boy Scout who is a member of a single sex Scouting organization</li>
<li>Girl Scout/Guide who is a member of a single sex Scouting organization</li>
<li>Boy Scout who is a member of a mixed sex Scouting organization</li>
<li>Girl Scout/Guide who is a member of a mixed sex Scouting organization</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The last two should really be covered in a single article since other than sex and sometimes name there is no difference between the two within each of their mixed sex organizations. In addition the differences between individual youth members of the same sex but of different national organizations is likely to be as great as that between a girl and a boy of different national organizations.--<a href="../../../e/r/p/User%7EErp_91c0.html" title="User:Erp">Erp</a> 00:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quite true, neither Boy Scouts nor Girl Scouts are necessarily single sex now. But what to call the article "Boy Scout and Girl Guide", "Co-ed Scout units", "Boy Scout"-but include girls (what this article does), etc. "Scout" is legitmately a redirect page. Then there's the issue of difference in Boy vs Girl organizations--such as in the USA there is a HUGE difference in the way BSA and GSUSA operate and their programs. Changing the article structure of several articles is a can of worms. I say just leave the names the way they are and discuss what has or is going on in the article. However, I can see renaming Girl Guides to Girl Guide (to match the Boy Scout convention) and making the focus girl-oriented vice movement oriented as the movement is well covered in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> and there are enough historical differeces to warrant this. Combining them could easily make the article lose focus. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 01:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not an issue in the UK, in Canada, in Australia or in New Zealand or in any other country that english is the main language. This section is pure USA and should not be on an international page.

<p>That may be the case, but there is no link on this page to said article and no information explaining that. How is somebody with no knowledge of the Boy Scout Association supposed to absorb the informatiom I added unless they decide to type "Boy Scout Association" instead of simply "Boy Scout", which they wouldn't do unless they already knew the difference between the "American" boy scout association and the alleged non-discriminatory international one anyways! You guys have that information locked up in such a way that it would be very difficult for the average lay-person to find, which suggests obvious bias. Furthermore if you were to do some research into the Boy Scout Organization you'd find that it originated in America and is primarily based here. The claim that this page is about scouts in Timbuktu and not the organization of scouts and scoutmasters is disingenuous at best. If the keepers of this page were to add some information explaining the boy scout assosciation of america (which according to you is the only one that discriminates against homosexuals and atheists) discriminated and provided a link to this controversy, or something like that, then I would be satisfied. But what it seems to me that what your doing is trying to keep otherwise ignorant people from getting a bad impression about Boy Scouts, which while doing so may protect your own intellectual intrests I don't think its for the best regarding the goal of building an accurate online encyclopedia.

<dd>I see that my mod to the "Boy Scouts" redirect hasn't been reverted, and in fact has been expanded upon. (I bent over backwards by not initially including a link to the BSA.) That indicates some measure of good faith. So perhaps if I explain the matter clearly enough, the reason for including a link to the controversy, or some form of related information, is appropriate. To be a Boy Scout, one must be a member of a Boy Scout organization. To be a member, one must meet its membership requirements. The BSA has, notably, established a religious requirement; one must believe in some kind of deity to be a member. You may consider this a good or bad thing, but it's certainly important and controversial. It may or may not be typical of Scouting organizations worldwide; I personally don't know. But that's also important. If the BSA is alone among world scouting organizations in imposing a religious requirement, then that's something people would want to know. If all Scouting organizations have such a requirement, or if some do and others don't, the same applies -- and in that case, it most definitely does affect "the Boy Scout on an international level." Like it or not, the BSA is the most visible organization with regard to this question of membership qualification, and people may well draw conclusions about organizations in other countries based on the BSA's criteria. Attempting to keep the issue undiscussed merely creates the impression of not wanting people to know. If the "controversies" link is not the appropriate way to do it, then a statement about whether or not a religious requirement is typical of worldwide Scouting organizations may be more appropriate. The view that Boy Scouts can somehow be regarded in isolation from the membership qualifications of Boy Scout organizations is, in any event, untenable. If you don't like my putting in a link, then put in something more informative and to the point. But let people know whether Boy Scouts in general exclude non-theists. <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 22:50, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have several problems with this. First, it is not just that this article is an international article. It is that the article is about Boy Scouts - the Scout section - as opposed to Cub Scouts, Beaver Scouts, Rover Scouts, Venture Scouts or members of other sections. Second it is not just a question of the religious requirement. All members of WOSM have a religigious requirement, but the consequencies of it differ. For example, only the BSA, as far as I know of organisations that have Buddhist members, insists on the wording "duty to God" in the Promise. Others allow "duty to my religion" or "duty to my Dharma" as alternatives. So the religious controversy in the BSA differs from that, if any, in other countries. The controversy about homosexuals is also not shared by other countries. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> is the article that deals with the movement as a whole world-wide and that article with its discussion of the Promise and links to articles about the Promise and to WOSM quite adequately, in my opinion, allows the reader to find out how different countries differ on membership requirements. If you do not agree, then that article, not one on a single section of Scouting, is the one to clarify whether all Scout organisations exclude non-theists or not. There is no need for a link to a specific BSA page or indeed a specific page from any Scout organisation or country on any international page. It is inappropriate. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Now you're going with a purely arbitrary assertion that the article is not about the organization. I notice you aren't deleting the sections about troop organization; if this article is about only the Boy-Scout-in-Isolation, what are those doing here? There is a word for what you're doing, Rlevse, and that's VANDALISM.

<dd><i>Obviously</i>, GMcGath has not fully researched this matter. The UK Scout Association does NOT exclude atheists out of hand - a declared atheist (or Humanist or Wiccan, to take two examples I personally know of) will be put through a slightly different process on application for an adult appointment, but this constitutes a conversation with their local commissioner (who has final approval on applicants - not national HQ). The only time national HQ can and will bar an applicant is someone who fails a Criminal Records Bureau background check. As you can see, each national organisation has very different policies and approaches to this issue - while the other items covered in the article (such as troop organisation) are pretty much universal. This is the argument for why they are in, and the (controversial) religious policies that you keep referring to should not be. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 14:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reaffirm my agreement here with Rlevse. I think part of the problem is the assertion that this article is about the Boy. It is really about the Boy Scout section and its members. It stands alongside <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scouts_621f.html" title="Cub Scouts">Cub Scouts</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_Scouts_ddd3.html" title="Rover Scouts">Rover Scouts</a>. This is why there is discussion about the organisation of the Troop. The insertion into <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> is appropriate. It should not be here, anymore than it should be in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scouts_621f.html" title="Cub Scouts">Cub Scouts</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_Scouts_ddd3.html" title="Rover Scouts">Rover Scouts</a>.

<p>Absolutely, Bduke. And make the vote 4-1 now. GMcGath seems to think it's okay for him to act unilaterally and against consensus and logical article structuring.

<p>I am initiating a Request for Comment on the issue of whether all references to the Boy Scouts' membership policies with respect to religion should be repeatedly deleted. To summarize: I added a link to <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies_32d9.html" title="Boy Scouts of America membership controversies">Boy Scouts of America membership controversies</a>. That was deleted on the grounds that it was specific to one scouting organization. As I pointed out, the controversy regarding the BSA is significant to all of Boy Scouting. So I did some research and added some text, covering the issue internationally (within the scope of the information I could gather) and without bias. This was deleted on the grounds that the article is only about the "individual boy scout" somehow existing apart from any scouting organization. After I pointed out the fallacy in this, the people who don't want the issue mentioned are resorting to mere superiority of numbers. Wikipedia does NOT give veto power on the basis of larger numbers.</p>
<p>The material which I added is relevant to what a Boy Scout is. It was presented properly. No one has disputed its factuality. Getting four people to say they don't like it counts for nothing. <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 23:51, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Factuality--see Horus Kol's proof your research was in error. The BSA controversies are specific to the BSA, not all of Scouting. The international scope of the religion issue is better covered in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> and MOVED there, NOT deleted, yet you fail to mention that; nor is that reasoning fallacious so claiming we dont' want it mentioned is a blatant untruth. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 00:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To suggest that anybody "got four people to say they do not like it" is uncivil. I watch these pages and comment when I feel like it, and nobody asked me to do so. It is also uncivil to keep saying that the material has been deleted when it has been moved. WP works by consensus within the contraints of its policies. There is no policy that says what you added has to be in this article and not in a more general article, but consensus is saying it should be in the general article. If it is in the Scout article, logically it should also be in the Cub article, the Rover article, the Beaver article and so on. It is best in the general article. Nobody is supporting you. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:15, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. I am not attempting to cover every article. I don't have time for that. Deleting something from this article is deletion; whether or not it appears in some other article is a separate issue. It is simple truth that the information was deleted; whatever was done to another article doesn't somehow turn that into "blatant untruth." If it's "uncivil" of me to mention the fact, that's too bad. If the other Scouting organizations also practice religious exclusion, then the fact should be mentioned in the appropriate article; The BSA's practice gets the most publicity; if other organizations are doing it, that should be brought to the light of day as well. Should people have to read every article to learn about a serious problem in an organization they might be sending their kids to join? And if they should, why was my link facilitating their doing do deleted -- sorry, "MOVED" out of the article? The deletion of both links and direct information in the article adds up to only one thing: an attempt to keep readers ignorant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Regarding "factuality," the correct approach is to correct facts, not to remove them (or "move" them out of the article). I stated that the BSA excludes people on the basis of religion and others do not, at least not to the same extent. If there were errors in detail, that's a good reason to keep the information there and correct it. What is so frightening to you about people's knowing the facts?</dd>

Following the policy, I'll continue to pursue the resolution process. As far as I can tell, my RFC hasn't brought in any new comments; I'll wait and see if anyone joins in once it's a weekday, and if not, see what else can be done to bring in outside mediation. <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 14:48, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GMcGath - your addition to the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> article was irrelevant to the scope of that article.

<dd><b>Weak include</b> In general, providing information is better than not providing it, and having links is better than not having them. I don't think this link is essential, but I also have no problem with including any articles about membership criteria for any national scouting organization (particularly one that makes up the plurality of boy scouts). However, I can see why this link might seem to be seen to give undue emphasis to one particular membership controversy, if appropriate weight is not also given to, for example, coeducational scouting worldwide in the "See Also" section. However, the best course would be to include all links to membership issues related to scouting, since that helps to explain who is, isn't, can, and cannot be a scout -- the subject of the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesmothete_249d.html" title="User:Thesmothete">Thesmothete</a> 19:11, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I understand your statement correctly, then the USA does appear to have the plurality of scouts who are boys -- if the proportion of scouts who are boys to scouts who are girls is the same in both Indonesia and the US. However, the original point is that the BSA represents and enormous proportion of scouts, and its policies may be particularly notable to readers of the EN Wikipedia, even if it were merely second in number compared to Indonesia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesmothete_249d.html" title="User:Thesmothete">Thesmothete</a> 22:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First I consider it invalid to differentiate boys who are scouts from girls who are scouts in organizations which are co-ed unless the organization does also. Second we have no way of knowing whether the boy scout members of the BSA are a plurality of boy scouts in the world. The actual number of Boy Scouts in the BSA is about 894,000 in 2005 (note I'm omitting cubs, venturing, learning for life, and adults [and note the last three all include women in the count]). I don't know how many of the Indonesia scouts are of the right age and gender (note that for Indonesia, Scouts ends at 16, those 16-21 are Rover Scouts which complicates comparisons). Third 6.2 out of 28 million is not an overwhelming plurality. Fourth English speaking countries would also include many of the Commonwealth countries (over 800,000 and not including India and Pakistan, another 2.6 million, where many of the scouts probably speak English as a second language); I suspect many of the Commonwealth scouting orgs share similarities that are not shared with the BSA. --<a href="../../../e/r/p/User%7EErp_91c0.html" title="User:Erp">Erp</a> 01:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The question is: is this dispute (the originial one, about who gets to be a scout) notable and relevant to the topic of the article? I believe that a big enough proportion of boy scouts are affected that it bears mentioning. You do not. Reasonable minds can differ, I suppose. And we do this time. This issue of what's a "plurality" is a third-order question and not worth pursuing further. I appreciate and respect your view, though I disagree with it.

<dd>If you mean <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Badge_f207.html" title="Wood Badge">Wood Badge</a> woggle, see that article. This article is about the youth Boy Scout, not adults.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 00:37, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>actually, I agree with Suicup - there's no mention of <a href="../../../w/o/g/Woggle.html" title="Woggle">Woggle</a> in the Boy Scout article - but why is <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Badge_f207.html" title="Wood Badge">Wood Badge</a> listed as part of the Boy Scout uniform? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 08:59, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't recall and I didn't notice it was in there yesterday, but I suppose because it's a worldwide uniform part. Since it's not a youth piece, I took it out. I also noted that woggle is also called slide since many people don't know what woggle means. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 11:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair does... I didn't know if other Scout organisation gave Wood Badges to under-18s... one of my leaders has started a system of giving something similar to the Wood Badge to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explorer_Scout_f943.html#Young_Leaders" title="Explorer Scout">Young Leaders</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 11:33, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the US they have youth training programs like Wood Badge, but it has various names over the years, but they don't get the WB neckerchief and woggle. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 12:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scouts_621f.html" title="Cub Scouts">Cub Scouts</a> article has links to nationally specific articles for the Cub/Cub Scout/Wolf Cub sections - could we do a similar thing with the Boy Scout article? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 17:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should remove the national ones in the Cub article. A link to a list of national associations would be okay, similar to what we just did on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> article. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 17:48, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you're proposing that we have sections in this article on each countries take on the Scout Programme (and Cubs and so on)? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 08:56, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
