<p>They have nothing to do with each other, other than the fact that Savages starred in both of them.</p>
<p>That is true... Although to say that it "never" was compared to <i>The Wonder Years</i> is a bit presumptuous, isn't it? However, it shouldn't be in the article unless it can be backed up...

<p>I'm adding the fact that Mr. Feeny taught Cory, Topanga, and Shawn every year of the show, and it is mentioned MANY times that Mr. Feeny has taught the three of them every single year of their lives, all through elementary school. However, Eric is still somehow a former student of Feeny's! This is another continuity problem... <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvtheheaven_f64a.html" title="User:Luvtheheaven">Emily</a> 21:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not necessarily. Eric was four years ahead of them in the first season, right? So, Feeny may very well have taught Eric when he was in third grade, or, he may have taught Eric in a different class. Pending how the system is set up, sometimes teachers even travel between Elementary and High schools throughout the day.</p>

<dd>Could someone familiar with the show maybe add the name of the actor who played them to each characters bio? And why bother having a link to "Topanga Lawrence" that redirects to this article in the article?Optimus Sledge 22:51, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should try to eliminate references to specific episodes from character descriptions. We should be focusing more on the overall development of the character instead. Hydrokinetics12 22:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the genre of the series page should be edited to be Teen Drama / Sitcom. Hydrokinetics12 21:19, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like the look of the Characters section, but it seems to have a few problems. The section on Cory does not talk about him at all, just his relationships to the other characters. Also the section on Topanga is much longer than any other section. Finally, there is no listing for Joshua Matthews, but he does have a separate article devoted to him. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahjane10784_0e82.html" title="User:Sarahjane10784">Sarahjane10784</a> 22:46, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have changed the top portion so that links to characters direct to the relevant subsection of the Characters section. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahjane10784_0e82.html" title="User:Sarahjane10784">Sarahjane10784</a> 23:11, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I merged the page Joshua Matthews with this page. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahjane10784_0e82.html" title="User:Sarahjane10784">Sarahjane10784</a> 21:33, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you. Did Boy Meets World count as having <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cousin_Oliver_Syndrome_585b.html" title="Cousin Oliver Syndrome">Cousin Oliver Syndrome</a> when Joshua was born? Just curious. Vulcanlad 21:08, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The show never really focused on Joshua though. It seemed like he was born, was a baby for awhile and then was like 4 in the series finale. Also, what's up with the use of middle names for some of the characters? It should be all or none. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikeZoft_ad8e.html" title="User:SpikeZoft">SpikeZoft</a> 13:36, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's OK with me. Joshua seemed to disappear, &amp; then reappear on the series finale, 3 years older. It wasn't <i>my</i> idea to use the characters' middle names. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.101.5.html" title="User:152.163.101.5">152.163.101.5</a> 18:40, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing people from the recurring characters list that have already been described in detail earlier in the characters section (J. Turner and C. Hunter)</li>
<li>Removing some POV items (e.g. - "She has an amazing talent for singing.")</li>
<li>Lengthening the section or Cory and shortening the section on Topenga. Doesn't anyone find it odd that the section on the main character is 1 paragraph and the section on Topenga is 8? I'll probably remove the section about her parents' actors changing as it doesn't have much to do with her and its mentioned again later on under the continuity section.</li>
<li>Changing the order on the characters section a bit (moving up Eric, Feeny, Alan, and Amy - I'll probably use the order in which they joined the show)</li>
<li>Updating info on the "The House" setting to including the boys' bedroom/bathroom.</li>
<li>Clean up the redundancy in the DVD releases section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also like to change up the synopsis a bit to focus less on similarities to other shows (Happy Days and Wonder Years) and more on what the show was actually about (common plotlines, etc). Please leave your thoughts here! <a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERscibett_8bce.html" title="User:Rscibett">Rscibett</a> 16:42, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Addition: I want to remove all the inconsistency information from the individual character bios since there is another whole section dedicated to it (there are a lot of duplicate references to topenga's sister, shawn's brother and sister, etc).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, when did the show parody Rounders? I think that's an error that should be removed unless someone can tell me otherwise. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERscibett_8bce.html" title="User:Rscibett">Rscibett</a> 20:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the synopsis can benefit from a season to season change rather than just a relisting of the main characters. Hydrokinetics12 22:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition to focusing less on similarities to other shows, the similarities to 1776 should also be removed. --<a href="../../../j/a/a/User%7EJaardon_33c6.html" title="User:Jaardon">Jaardon</a> 07:14, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This fact is mentioned in the trivia section dedicated to links between Boy Meets World and 1776.

<p>Chet Hunter makes an appearance as a ghost in the series finale. He is upset when Jack Hunter has made the decision to give up his money and go off with Rachel. He accepts it when he realizes that they are going to the peace corps, to help people. He says goodbye to Jack and Shawn. Before he leaves, he pinches Rachel. I made a minor change to the Chet Hunter bio to reflect this. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERev._Uncle_Adam_4811.html" title="User:Rev. Uncle Adam">Rev. Uncle Adam</a> 22:50, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't point of view, the show has flat out made these statements. In "Wheels" it's explicitly stated by both Eric and Cory, that Alan's favorite is Eric. You also see Alan dealing with Eric constantly and them having a buddy/buddy relationship whereas Eric would view Amy as a disciplinarian and meaner, and they have the constant issue of how Alan babied Eric because he was his first born. Also, Amy is clearly closest with Morgan, in that you pretty much only see Alan and Morgan interract because of some issue he's having with one or both of his sons and so turning his attention to the other child he has. Whereas during the rare occasions you see Morgan she interracts more with her mother than any other character.--Harlequin212121 03:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is your point of view. Something implied in one episode doesn't necessarily apply to the whole series, especially in one such as this which often adapts the storyline to the particular episode. How you view their relationships and your commentary on it does not belong on the page per Wikipedia guidelines. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner">Shannernanner</a> 15:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except here's the thing, it's not my point of view. I didn't put anything on this that wasn't fact. Eric and Cory physically SAY that Alan's favorite with Eric, and if you wanted to get a stopwatch out on all of Morgan's scenes you'd probably see her interract with Amy about twice as often as you'd see her interract with Alan, this is all empirical evidence not something any one is making up. None of this is my opinion, it's things that become evidencial after watching the program. Besides, it's not as if you changed this one thing. Every single change that were made, many of which could not possibly construed as opinion and were only giving more information to a character or situation. You just decided to write the entire edit off. Notice how you are the only one with a problem with it? The purpose of this site is to provide information, how about letting that happen? And not going out of your way to stifle something just because you personally seem to have a problem with the edits. For instance, the character order was also changed to put Angela, Jack and Rachel in front of Mr. Turner and Mr. Williams. This is a logical thing to do as Angela, Jack and Rachel all appear in the series more than Mr. Turner and certainly Mr. Williams do. There is no reasonable explanation for why it should be anything but in this order, but you have appeared to develop a sort of vendetta against that particular edit. --Harlequin212121 22:08, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps everyone can come to some middleground here. I firmly believe that Harlequin is completely acting with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. Many of the edits that Harlequin has done are fairly straightforward copyedits and article improvements. From what I can tell, only a subset of the changes made are under dispute. In order to help "sandbox" the problem, could someone please itemize the content under dispute? In addition, if the content that Harlequin wants to add is cited by an episode (which is usually considered <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>), can we all agree that that is a reliable citation? Afterall, what better source is there for an element of a fictional story than the story itself? Of course, there can also be counter-examples. Here's an example of how something like this could be worded: "The character dynamics between Alice, Bob, and Charlie are complex. In "Episode X", Bob claims to be Alice's best friend, but in "Episode Y", Bob and Charlie practically ignore Alice." Any thoughts? <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 18:20, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since it would appear Shannernanner is the one with the issue, perhaps they or someone who agrees with them can do said cataloguing. For my part, in addition to adding my own edits back in (which until this is actually cleared up for good, I will continue to do) I tried to make things that Shannernanner found troubling (particularly in regards to Amy and Alan as those seem to be where his bigger issues lie. My edits to Morgan and Jack have been reverted without much comment as to the reasons why, and appear to just be Shannernanner wishing to remove my edits with one foul swoop.) Anyways, the point is I've tried to make things a bit more clear. I hope it helps some.--Harlequin212121 19:59, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop re-adding your edits and reverting others' edits. Your last reversion deleted relevant additions, copyedits (including wording changed to fictional present), and corrected information. If you would like an itemized list of the NPOV/original research issues with your edits, I'll attempt to provide it. In your last reversion:
<ol>
<li>Alan "[has] also at times lacked the supportiveness that he should show" (NPOV: What supportiveness "should" he show?)</li>
<li>"At times during the later years of the show, Alan failed to have faith in Eric when it came to jobs and overall successfulness in life. This was due to the fact that of all his children, Alan was, by his own admission, the closest with Eric due to his position as the oldest and, as Amy tells Alan, he has coddled Eric and babyed him his entire life, resulting in the lazy, immature (despite being naturally intelligent) Eric that exists today." (NPOV/original research, especially that Alan "caused" Eric's behavior.)</li>
<li>"Generally speaking, while Morgan was the child that was 'her's' (likely due to her position as the only girl) and Eric was the child that was 'Alan's', the two of them almost evenly tended after Cory." (NPOV: "Generally," "likely.")</li>
<li>"She's precocious and well aware of her cuteness, although she develops a bit of a temperamental streak as she hits puberty at the series' close." (NPOV: "well aware of her cuteness.")</li>
<li>Angela is "beautiful," "very classy" (NPOV)</li>
<li>issues "of angst" (just awkward)</li>
<li>"Interestingly" (NPOV)</li>
<li>"In one of the episodes where she and Shawn break up, she is seen dating a black man, perhaps an allusion to the fact that she is always sensitive to the fact that she is the only African-American in her group of friends." (NPOV, "perhaps an allusion," plus non-notable)</li>
<li>"The half-brother of Shawn, Jack is the opposite of Shawn" (sounds awkward, plus second half is POV)</li>
<li>"although it's unclear if [Rachel and Jack] end up together at the series' close" (non-notable, not an issue towards the end of the series)</li>
<li>"Although Jack was quickly cemented in the group by virtue of being made Shawn's brother and Eric's roommate, he wasn't really used for very much (in comparison to larger characters like Cory, Eric and Shawn) and never truly developed an indentity of his own. His own personality becoming fluid depending on what the writers' wanted (e.g. he could be smart if it fit the writers' story or he could be stupid if that worked better.)" (largely POV, though could possibly be adapted to the article)</li>
<li>Mr. Turner's "new age" approach (NPOV, not how it was portrayed directly on the show)</li>
<li>"Eventually Mr. Turner became for Shawn what Mr. Feeny was for Cory and Eric." (possibly could be adapted, right now sounds POV; what was Mr. Feeny for Cory and Eric?)</li>
<li>Mr. Turner was a "beloved" character (NPOV)</li>
<li>Mr. Turner was "responsible for introducing the character of" Eli Williams (doesn't make sense as stated)</li>
<li>Mr. Williams "is hip, cool" (NPOV) -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 20:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you, Shannernanner. This is very helpful. I enumerated your list for ease of reference; I hope that's okay. Other than things of this nature, is this the sum of your issues? I do think that you are casting your nets a little wide here. For example, if the items in #2 could be backed using various episodes as a source, I would think that it would be acceptable. Again, I would conclude that canon is an excellent source here. However, I do agree that some of these are probably <b>not</b> backed by canon or other citable sources, and therefore should not be added. Harlequin has also made many changes outside of these. Is there any objection if Harlequin, if he/she so chooses, makes those uncontested changes? <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 21:45, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. I'm not sure what you mean by Harlequin's "other changes," I certainly don't have any issue with the user making edits in general. If you mean the other edits which used to be contained with these, I can go back in the history and enumerate them if needed, I suppose. The items in "#2" are, as I pointed out to the user, part of a storyline adapted to a certain episode (rather than canon), which is a device utilized throughout the series. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 22:31, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it is part of a storyline of the series, how is it not canon? Usually, one implies the other. In other words, if the events of the episodes can't be used as a primary source, what can be? I understand that story dynamics can change from one episode to the next and sometimes flatly contradict each other. However, as long as the source episode is cited and indicated, I really can see nothing wrong with it. In a fictional universe, the episodes define the "truth" as it were. Perhaps I don't fully understand. Could you further elaborate? <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 22:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry I wasn't clear. What I meant to imply was that it wasn't true to the series as a whole. It is not something that is mentioned, implied, or detailed throughout the series; something that belongs on an encyclopedic synopsis about a character. It belongs more on the specific episode page. It was not a "revelation" of "Alan has caused Eric to become 'who he is'"--it was one episode that decided to re-paint the characters in a certain light. If it were an issue addressed throughout the series, it would make sense. As it is, it lends undo credence to an incidental storyline. I understand your point about fictional universe, but in a fictional universe truth is also easily shifted. In this particular series, this often happened. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 23:15, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While what you say is true, what you present can become a sticky-point for POV. At this point, it becomes the personal opinions of the editors to determine what is, and what is not, applicable to the whole -- which episodes are "canon" and which are not. Up above, I put "truth" in quotes. The reason for this is that Wikipedia is more interested in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability, not truth</a> (but I couldn't find a better word than 'truth' above, which is why I quoted it). As long as we have a reliable source, which includes the episodes themselves, I really see no issue. HOWEVER, this should all be tempered by the fact that for the vast majority of the edits, no source has been provided as of yet. This is all hypothethical based on the presumption that such episodic references can be found. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 23:29, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not intend to say it was not a "canonical" episode, it was a poor choice of words; as I said, I was not clear. The issue is not whether or not the information can be verified (that it happened, though the information itself was not presented in NPOV). It's more an issue of <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retroactive continuity</a>, and for only one episode, at that. The "issue" was not addressed again. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShannernanner_f73a.html" title="User:Shannernanner"><span style="font-family: Palatino"><font color="indigo">Shannernanner</font></span></a> 23:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off I just want to say that a good many of those things listed are not my edits to begin with. I have done no editing to any character entries other than Cory, Eric, Alan, Amy, Morgan and Jack. And some of the things mentioned about Jack weren't me either (when I first made changes to the Jack article, he was already mentioned as being Shawn's opposite, the only change I made was that it claimed Jack worked out which was the opposite of Shawn, and I didn't get the sense that Shawn's lack of working out or Jack's working out were big enough character issues to be mentioned so I omitted them) So anything to do with Angela, Mr. Turner or any other character wasn't me and these are the ones which feature the issue of terms such as "beautiful", "classy" and "hip." (Although in defense of Mr. Turner being hip, I believe that term is specifically used by other students to describe, so perhaps that one can be made to say something about his students finding him hip.) The bottom line is, however, any changes needing to be made about them, anyone can feel free. In fact, to go through the list 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11 are really the only ones I take any responsibility for. These ones I stand by. To talk about the issue of Alan and Eric's relationship, Shannernanner is incorrectly claiming the episode in question "Security Guy" as a random history revising episode. It isn't in the slightest and the issues of Alan's treatment towards Eric (while intended positively) having negative consequences on his maturity, is addressed elsewhere, the episode "Raging Cory" being one such example. However, I neglect to see how even if it was that one episode (which it isn't) why this isn't canon. It happened in the episode and nothing later on ever refuted it's accuracy. And above all it certainly isn't in violation of NPOV. --Harlequin212121 00:02, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, but that is the version which you reverted to, disregarding the improvements which had been made. Not all of the things I listed were deleted; some had been edited to NPOV statements ("Like Turner, Williams is 'considered "hip and cool"'"). People <i>did</i> make changes to their sections, but your continuous reverts undid them. I disagree with you regarding the episode and its relevance to a character synopsis; however, if you wish to add it, something like this would be more appropriate, with proper citations:</dd>

<dd>I stopped reverting a long time ago, as a matter of fact. I've just been individually adding all my edits in. You're the only one going reversion-crazy, and you continue to. You reverted all my changes again even after this whole discussion and after the mediator requested that you stop with the continous reversions. There's such thing as a compromise, and most of your list is being dealt with. You might have to suck it up and deal with a lot of my edits, some of which were not considered inappropriate by any but you. That said, I'm adding my material in again. I don't understand how you can so completely disregard what the mediator's been trying to do, I however will continue to try with the compromising. Continue with the constant, unyielding reversions and someone else will again have to get involved. If there is an edit you feel needs made, like the one you mentioned above for Eric, why can't you make it? Why do you always have to revert all of my contributions? --Harlequin212121 00:13, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Excellent! Looks like we are making some real progress for an agreement here. From here, I'm going to make the following compromise offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harlequin -- Apply your changes without undoing other editor's changes and please keep in mind a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral tone</a> when you make them. Remember not to have the article assert anything as fact that another editor can't independently verify. Remember to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite your sources</a>!</li>
<li>Shannernanner -- If Harlequin makes changes that you disagree with, please do not do a mass revert, thereby throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. Instead, I recommend <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> discussion and <b>refactoring</b> the troubling items to be more neutral, like you did above. Your proposed rewording is excellent. Remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.</li>

<p>Eric's middle name keeps going back and forth between Randall and Allison. Is the latter really vandalism, as suggested, or is this merely one of the many continuity gaffes on the show? After all, if Shawn can have a sister for only one episode, then Eric can have two different middle names. Rather that just reverting, it would be good to know whether the alternate middle name is being entered here for a legitimate reason. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 20:58, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's Randal. Though, he does mistakenly believe his name is Neil in a third season episode, but is corrected by his parents. --<a href="../../../o/g/o/User%7EOGoncho_d155.html" title="User:OGoncho">OGoncho</a> 23:30, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He claims it's Allison in "The Witches of Pennbrook" actually, so it's not *vandalism*, but I'm fairly sure he wasn't being serious. It's Randall. --Harlequin212121 05:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the latest edit is correct about Feeny marrying Bolander before he mentions his wife heard a rumor about Cory and Topanga (and it may not be for all I know; I'm no expert), then there is no inconsistency in the reference, and it doesn't need to be mentioned in the section. Can anyone confirm a sequence of events here? Are there any inconsistencies at all in Feeny's family relationships? <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 21:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
