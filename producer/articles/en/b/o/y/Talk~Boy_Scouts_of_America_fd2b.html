<p>Norman Rockwell is mentioned in passing on this page. I suggest somehow highlighting his work for the Boy Scouts, his love for the Boy Scouts, etc. It is yet another way to show how the BSA is a pillar of American life. It includes wonderful pictures, one of which should appear on this page, perhaps one from the cover of Boys Life magazine. Look at the description for A rated pages. They say the article should have great pictures. This article does not, in my opinion, have the best of pictures at this time. A Norman Rockwell will really add quality in appearance and in tying in the BSA with American culture. The BSA is not just an organization; it's a major factor in the American way of life and has been for a long time, and this article should reflect that. --<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegitimateAndEvenCompelling_4e11.html" title="User:LegitimateAndEvenCompelling">LegitimateAndEvenCompelling</a> 17:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Possibly.

The licensing on the artwork only allows useage in an article that is specifically obout that piece. The Time cover allows useage in an article that notes the issue represented by the cover. Time may have released article covers in this manner. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 15:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We can use a painting in an article if there is substantial discussion of the painting. It does not have to be a complete article specifically about the painting, but it does need to be discussion, not just a mention. So, depending on how much room we want to give to the topic, it would be possible to bring it in here. I question, though, whether we want that much discussion here about one painter and his works in this top-level article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:52, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rockwell is not just any painter. He is the epitome of America. The Boy Scouts are the epitome of America. The two merge in beautiful paintings that really set the BSA apart from any other organization. A sentence or two is enough, but it does set the stage for a deeply rooted American institution, and that's what I hope this article conveys, among other things, because it is true. --<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegitimateAndEvenCompelling_4e11.html" title="User:LegitimateAndEvenCompelling">LegitimateAndEvenCompelling</a> 01:14, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am under the impression that when a section in this article (such as origins/history, uniforms or advancement) is associated with a "main article" that it is customary for the lead-in paragraphs of the main article be used as the text in the referring article, as is done with the membership controversies. I would make those changes myself, but they would be major changes so I brought it here to Talk. I actually think that those lead-ins would work quite nicely and would like to see the changes made. --204.113.19.8 22:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 4th paragraph, describing famous scouts, doesn't summerize the organization, does it? Notice how the Girl Scouts of the USA page has a nice section "Impact on American life", which I think would hold these famous people, the Norman Rockwell reference mentioned on this talk page, mention of the List of notable Scouts (and Eagle Scouts) pages, etc, instead of trying to cram it into the organization's summary. Doesn't "11 of the 12 men on the moon were scouts" read like a factoid, not an overview of the organization? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWild_Pansy_386a.html" title="User:Wild Pansy">Wild Pansy</a> 17:53, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. This article is still in need of a lot of work- we haven't even tried to promote it to GA yet. I do like that section in the GSUSA article and have indeed considered ripping it. This article has developed a lot in the last year. I will be back as soon as I get <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Eagle_Scouts_2f38.html" title="List of notable Eagle Scouts">List of notable Eagle Scouts</a> to featured status.

<p>Here are a few thoughts, please comment and add as you see:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Add "Impact on American life" like the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA_835b.html" title="Girl Scouts of the USA">Girl Scouts of the USA</a> article.

<li>This does look like it should be a section of the "History" article. However, this article needs to define a Good Turn. Originally, the term refers to any favor or kindness, but nationwide actions such as the "Good Turn for America" obviously represent something different.</li>

<dd>Not that I know of. Not even the Mormons require their Scouts to belong to the church (unless it's changed) because I've known non-Mormons who were in Mormon sponsored troops. What's different about the Mormon church is that Scouting is their youth program, not just something the church supports.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 18:03, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you're saying that non-Mormons boys can join Mormon sponsored troops? (I think the Mormons use church members exclusively as adult leaders.) --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 18:30, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I have personally seen that, non-Mormon boys joining Mormon sponsored troops. I myself am a leader in a Catholic sponsored troop but I'm not Catholic. 19:07, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is true. I am an Asst. District Commissioner with several units sponsored by the LDS Church in our district. They only require that boys who want to join their units keep their standards. This is rarely a problem because the standards referred to are pretty much not smoking, drinking, swearing, etc. which most Scoutmasters would want anyway. Boys who join are treated just like LDS boys in terms of fees and awards. (The Church pays for almost all fees and awards.) Boys who belong to other churches can work on their respective religious awards, too, although this is pretty rare, because LDS Scouters are generally not familiar with the requirements.</dd>
<dd>As for adults - local leaders can ask non-LDS adults to be leaders in certain circumstances. Again, the criteria are that the keep LDS standards and that they are willing to teach boys LDS standards. It is not uncommon for parents from "mix-religion" (or whatever the PC term is) families to be involved in Scouting as adult leaders. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 16:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That looks like a good starting point. Lists tend to grow like mushrooms after a rainshower, often by becoming crufty.

<dd>Rovers could have a para for sure, but I think a list is bad form, my 2 cents is to put them back in the body if it's expanded. The ZHP is not a part of BSA AFAIK, so I don't even think they should be in the main article.

<dd>The article is on the BSA, I simply think RR and such is better in See also. If you really want it in the main body, please make it prose, not a list as if this ever goes for FA, it'll get pinged most likely. Another option is a "Scouting in the United States" article, where all Scouting related orgs would be covered, then a short summary para with a main link would be the way to go. On another note, this made GA today and was improved in the process, my whole goal.

<p>The article is well-written and well organized. But if you're using in-line citations than all sections should have some citation in them, or you should maintain a notes section as different from a more general reference section that might include more general sources rather than citing each statement or paragraph - unless of course you're working towards FA.

<p>● Declaration of Religious Principle, Bylaws of Boy Scouts of America, art. IX, § 1, cl. 1 “The Boy Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God. In the first part of the Scout Oath or Promise the member declares, ‘On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law.’ The recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgment of His favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members. No matter what the religious faith of the members may be, this fundamental need of good citizenship should be kept before them. The Boy Scouts of America, therefore, recognizes the religious element in the training of the member, but it is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward that religious training. Its policy is that the home and the organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life.”</p>
<p>● Bylaws of Boy Scouts of America, art. IX, § 1, cls. 2-4. “The activities of the members of the Boy Scouts of America shall be carried on under conditions which show respect to the convictions of others in matters of custom and religion, as required by the twelfth point of the Scout Law, reading ‘Reverent. A Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others.’”</p>
<p>“In no case where a unit is connected with a church or other distinctively religious organization shall members of other denominations or faith be required, because of their membership in the unit, to take part in or observe a religious ceremony distinctly unique to that organization or church.”</p>
<p>“Only persons willing to subscribe to these declarations of principles shall be entitled to certificates of leadership in carrying out the Scouting program.”</p>

<p>"The purpose of the Boy Scouts of America is to promote, through cooperation with other agencies, the ability of youth to do things for themselves and others, and to teach youth patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues. In achieving this purpose, emphasis is placed upon the Boy Scouts of America’s educational program and its oaths, promises, and codes for character development, citizenship training, and mental and physical fitness."<a href="http://www.scouting.org/forms/28-501.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scouting.org/forms/28-501.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 22:34, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
