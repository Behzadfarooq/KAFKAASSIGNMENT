<p>(<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Franklin_%28actor%29_cbfb.html" title="John Franklin (actor)">John Franklin</a>) Isaac Chroner was born, according to the age of the movie provided, September 19, 1973. As a young child, he developed a highly advanced vocabulary, was taught by the church how to preach, and stayed in the cornfields often. When he was only seven, he killed his parents and went to Gatlin, Nebraska through the cornfields, so as to not be disturbed. As time went by, people realized his mission: to rid the town of the adults who inhabit it and make way for the glorious coming of He Who Walks Behind The Rows, in order to fulfill the prophecy (see below). The original "giver of his word", he took over after the children of Gatlin began to see him as a leader figure, following him into the corn and listening to his preaching of He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Over a period of time, he authored THE BOOK OF DIVINE ENLIGHTENMENT, or as some say the Children of the Corn bible. Eventually, the children completely converted to his way of thinking, and murdered their own parents at his will. It was around this time that he made the prophecy that He Who Walks Behind the Rows will awaken when the daughter of the original chosen and the son of the original chosen provide a new generation of the chosen children. He's loyal to He Who Walks Behind The Rows, and typically obeys him. However, by the end of Children of the Corn Issac becomes power-hungry, and is struck down by his own God. After the events of the first film, the children of Gatlin manage to bring him into hiding, while preserving his status in critical care. When diagnosed, it was found that he had suffered two fractures to the head which required stitching, that his ankles and wrists were severely bruised, his arm joints were torn, and he'd shifted two plates in his back. He fell into a coma and woke up nineteen years later. He was determined to resurrect the corn religion, but couldn't successfully pull off all that was required of him, being weak and unwilling to meet the harsher demands of He Who Walks Behind The Rows. When he challenged He Who Walk Behind The Rows' demands, he was killed, with the coroner's report stating that the cause of death was heart organ failure due to stabbing and apparent blood lost.</p>

<p>(<a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Bollman_f29a.html" title="Ryan Bollman">Ryan Bollman</a>)</p>
<p>The second leader/preacher after Isaac, Micah is a slightly different case. While Isaac obeyed He Who Walks Behind The Rows of his own free will, Micah was possessed by him in the cornfields. Taking over Micah's body, destroyed the good in him and replaced it with the seed of evil. Sly and careful, Micah was a formidable preacher and more then a match for anyone. Obsessed with completing the mission. He'll let nothing stand in his way. Micah also brought the children to his will, but in the end He Who Walks Behind the Rows forced himself out of Micah so he couldn't die at the hands of the a corncutter. Micah awoke from being possessed and was killed though he didn't deserved the fate.</p>

<p>(Daniel Cerny)</p>
<p>Eli, short for Elliot Avila, is a strange one to describe. Through he has a connection to He Who Walks Behind The Rows, and serves his will, he's a different creature. Eli appears human, but is really a huge creature with tentacle-like claws and fangs. He does one better, as he spreads the evil that started in Gatlin all the way to Chicago. He starts off by turning almost all high school students into almost-mindless drones, following the orders of He Who Walks Behind The Rows. He also carries a bible with him which acts as his "other half". His half-brother ends up destroying him with this book. (like a worm, he had to destroy both sides body &amp; book)</p>

<p>(Brandon Kleyla)</p>
<p>Josiah was a boy preacher when he was alive. His mother abandoned him at a very young age, and he was taken in by a band of traveling preachers. Through some strange way, he learned to preach as though it were in his blood. People came to hear him, and the preachers made money off of him. But they knew that to keep the money coming, Josiah had to look as young as possible. So they didn't let him sleep, they fed him poison, and did everything to keep him young. Through, all this torture made Josiah go insane. The peachers finally decided to sell his soul in return for his youth. Not able to take it anymore, Josiah hacked them to death. But people found out, dragged him out into the cornfields, and burned him alive. Josiah comes back life to avenge his death, and get back his soul. He's obsessed with regaining his life, but the only way to get it back was to find a child who was abandoned and lied to like he was. There isn't any mention of He Who Walks Behind The Rows but there are some signs that point out that Josiah may be him.</p>
