Jimmy typically has a "Brain Blast" once an episode, usually at his climax of the story when all other ideas have failed, and it is accompanied by a display of his ideas floating within the inner workings of his <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>.</p>

<p>No one knows the exact location of Retroville, other than the fact that it is located somewhere in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. In many episodes, characters often take off or land in a <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_car.html" title="Flying car">hoverdrone</a> somewhere on the U.S. east or west coast. In "Lights, Camera, Danger", a lot of people misunderstood Jimmy after Quentin Smithee said that the movie was going to be shot in Retroville. Some thought Jimmy said "My screenplay takes place in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, not <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>." when what he said was "My screenplay takes place in London, the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, a mythical land in Texas, Retroville doesn't look like any of those." Interestingly though, in one episode, when Jimmy took off in the hoverdrone, a map showing his progress did show his starting point as being in the vicinity of Central Texas. One strong clue that they live in Texas is the TX that can be seen on Goddard's license plate in the original movie. Also in an episode where Jimmy, Carl and Sheen are thrown into a dumpster, the phone number on the dumpster for the garbage company gives an <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code.html" title="Area code">area code</a> for <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>, placing Retroville in the vicinity of Dallas. Plus, in the episode Stranded, when Jimmy and Cindy are flying to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, the starting point seems to be in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>.</p>

<div class="messagebox cleanup metadata"><b>This article contains a trivia section.</b><br />
Content in this section should be <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">integrated</a> into other appropriate areas of the article or removed, and the trivia section removed.</div>
<ul>
<li>The writing on the chalkboard in Ms. Fowl's classroom never changes.</li>
<li>The writing on Ms. Fowl's chalkboard involves information far above Jimmy's grade-level (notably, several equations explaining <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstring_Theory_60d1.html" title="Superstring Theory">Superstring Theory</a>)</li>
<li>All of the main characters have changed appearances from the movie to the TV series. In the series, Jimmy wears jeans and white shoes as opposed to shorts and brown shoes in the movie. Carl is mostly unchanged except for his suspenders being removed. Cindy meanwhile, was changed the most, from her hair (two pig tails in the movie; one ponytail in the series) to her outfit (pink shirt and shoes with black pants in the movie; green/grey striped tank top, brown khaki capris, and white shoes in the series). Libby was originally unchanged, but in the second season she has a different hairstyle, a pink and purple striped shirt and jeans compared to her blue dress from the movie and season 1. Even Nick has a new appearance from a leather jacket to his normal suede. Contrary to popular belief, Sheen has changed. The ends of his sleeves were darker in the movie than in the series.</li>
<li>Ever since the TV Movie <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Twonkies_%28film%29_7966.html" title="Attack of the Twonkies (film)">Attack of the Twonkies</a></i>, Sheen's Twonkie, along with the two other Twonkies it gave birth to, have made several cameo appearances.</li>
<li>The recurring villain Tee is an obvious <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._T_d006.html" title="Mr. T">Mr. T</a>. He sounds like him and says the classic "fool" line a lot too. Almost as obviously, Travoltron is supposed to be a parody of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Travolta_d5f5.html" title="John Travolta">John Travolta</a>, and comments are sometimes made about his masculinity.</li>
<li>The song <i>Go Jimmy Jimmy</i>, originally from the movie is the only song (besides the original theme) heard in the series (one episode, <i>Attack of the Pants</i>).</li>
<li>Sheen's last name is Estevez referred to the actor Charlie Sheen and his brother Emilio Estevez.</li>
<li>There are two references to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>. In the episode The Great Egg Heist, Sheen becomes interested in a Japanese girl who calls herself 'Peggy' Tzu. (prononced Sue), Sheen says, "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Sue_6198.html" title="Peggy Sue">Peggy Sue</a>," Which are lyrics in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>'s song, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Sue_6198.html" title="Peggy Sue">Peggy Sue</a>. Another is in Operation: Rescue Jet Fusion near the end <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet.html" title="Jet">Jet</a> says," Maybe you'll <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">star</a> in your own <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie.html" title="Movie">movie</a> someday." Jimmy replies,"<a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27ll_Be_The_Day_2524.html" title="That'll Be The Day">That'll Be The Day</a>," which is a song by Buddy Holly.</li>
<li>In the episode <i>League of Villains</i>, the character Granny Taters is actually from the episode "One of Us," which premiered weeks after The League of Villains. This was also the case with the baby Eddie.</li>
<li>In the episode "I Dream of Jimmy" (a clear reference to the show <a href="../../../i/_/d/I_Dream_of_Jeannie_05f5.html" title="I Dream of Jeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a>), Sheen mentions having a little sister, although she is never seen.</li>
<li>The television theme music was written and performed by Brian Causey (a.k.a Star Crunch from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_or_Astro-man__4224.html" title="Man or Astro-man?">Man or Astro-man?</a>). The version of the theme song in the film, while based on Causey's theme, was performed by <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_for_Soup_7f88.html" title="Bowling for Soup">Bowling for Soup</a>.</li>
<li>In almost all of the episodes with the school and classroom involved, "Planetarium <a href="../../../t/u/e/Tuesday.html" title="Tuesday">Tuesday</a>" is written on the blackboard.</li>
<li>From 2002 to January 24, 2007 the show was rated TV-Y. Starting January 25, 2007, the show is rated TY-Y7. At the same time, SpongeBob Squarepants and The Fairly OddParents were also switched from TV-Y to TY-Y7.</li>
<li>Jimmy's last name (Neutron) is actually one of three main parts of an atom. Proton, Neutron, and Electron.</li>
<li>The director is obviously a fan of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quentin_Tarantino_858b.html" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> movies. In the episode "Send In The Clones" the scene at the end where all the clones are walking in slow motion is based on the intro to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reservoir_Dogs_75c2.html" title="Reservoir Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a>. also in the episode "Party at Neutrons" when Jimmy is dancing with Betty Quinlan, its based on the dance John Travolta and <a href="../../../u/m/a/Uma_Thurman_a4ed.html" title="Uma Thurman">Uma Thurman</a> do in <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_Fiction_f567.html" title="Pulp Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>. Also in "Lights, Camera, Danger", Quentin Smithee looks and sounds exactly like Tarantino.</li>
