<p><b>George Alan O'Dowd</b>, better known as <b>Boy George</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/t/Eltham%2C_London_c4e2.html" title="Eltham, London">Eltham</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>) is a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> singer-songwriter. George grew up in a large, working-class <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> family, which originated in <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurles.html" title="Thurles">Thurles</a>, in <a href="../../../c/o/2E/Co._Tipperary_eee8.html" title="Co. Tipperary">Co. Tipperary</a>.</p>
<p>O'Dowd gained fame with his group <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Club_0c51.html" title="Culture Club">Culture Club</a> during the 1980s. His music is often classified as <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue-eyed_soul.html" title="Blue-eyed soul">blue-eyed soul</a>, since he was heavily influenced by <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">reggae</a>. Early recordings with <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Club_0c51.html" title="Culture Club">Culture Club</a> showed that O'Dowd's vocals had an emotional quality which was reminiscent of American <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul music</a> of the 1960s and 1970s. His later solo work has also touched on <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_rock.html" title="Glam rock">glam rock</a> influences and was particularly influenced by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> and <a href="../../../i/g/g/Iggy_Pop_f985.html" title="Iggy Pop">Iggy Pop</a>.</p>
<p>Boy George is also known for his flamboyant appearance back in the 80s and early 90s.</p>

<p>Boy George was a visible figure in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> club scene; his <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgyny.html" title="Androgyny">androgynous</a> style caught the attention of music executive <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_McLaren_acba.html" title="Malcolm McLaren">Malcolm McLaren</a>, of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Pistols_b1a7.html" title="Sex Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> fame, who arranged for O'Dowd to perform with the group <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_Wow_Wow_f4af.html" title="Bow Wow Wow">Bow Wow Wow</a>, featuring <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annabella_Lwin_39bc.html" title="Annabella Lwin">Annabella Lwin</a>, at various shows. He was christened <i>Lieutenant Lush</i> and he nearly stole the spotlight from Lwin.</p>
<p><a name="Culture_Club" id="Culture_Club"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_George_afef.html" title="Edit section: Culture Club">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture Club</span></h3>
<p>Boy George's association with Bow Wow Wow ended soon afterwards, and he started his own group with bassist <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikey_Craig_865f.html" title="Mikey Craig">Mikey Craig</a>. The group was to be called <i>In Praise Of Lemmings</i>, but the name was later abandoned. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Moss_92d2.html" title="Jon Moss">Jon Moss</a> (who had drummed with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Damned_3bce.html" title="The Damned">The Damned</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_the_Ants_983e.html" title="Adam and the Ants">Adam and the Ants</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_%28band%29.html" title="London (band)">London</a>) then joined the group and became George's lover. The final member to join the band was <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Hay_6017.html" title="Roy Hay">Roy Hay</a> (who at the time was guitarist in a band called Russian Bouquet), who was selected after the group's association with another guitarist, 'Suede', proved unsatisfactory. The group abandoned another name, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Gang_Children_5b64.html" title="Sex Gang Children">Sex Gang Children</a>, and settled on the name <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Club_0c51.html" title="Culture Club">Culture Club</a> after realising that the group consisted of an Irish singer, a Jamaican-Briton on bass, a Jewish drummer, and an Englishman on guitar.</p>
<p>The band signed with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Records_4102.html" title="Virgin Records">Virgin Records</a> in the UK and with <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Records_6e4e.html" title="Epic Records">Epic Records</a> in America, and released its debut album <i>Kissing To Be Clever</i> in 1982. The album's third single, "<a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_You_Really_Want_to_Hurt_Me__b2f0.html" title="Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?">Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?</a>", enjoyed massive success. It reached #1 in sixteen countries (#2 U.S.), and the group became a staple on American radio and the new <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> network. This single was followed by "Time (Clock Of The Heart)" (not on the UK LP), which reached #2, and "I'll Tumble 4 Ya", which reached #9. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a> to amass at least three top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a début album. Their next album, <i>Colour By Numbers</i> was also a success. The single "Church Of The Poison Mind" (featuring <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Terry_0d0b.html" title="Helen Terry">Helen Terry</a>) became a Top 10 hit, and "<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma_Chameleon_35f5.html" title="Karma Chameleon">Karma Chameleon</a>" became a #1 single in numerous countries around the world, including the U.S., where it stayed at #1 for four weeks, and the UK, where it was the best-selling single of the year, spending six weeks at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Number_1_singles_from_the_1980s_%28UK%29_3f36.html" title="List of Number 1 singles from the 1980s (UK)">#1</a>. It stands as the group's biggest hit. "Miss Me Blind" and "It's A Miracle" were Top 5 and Top 20 hits respectively, and "Victims" was another Top 3 UK hit.</p>
<p>That George had become the main songwriter of the band became evident when Culture Club contributed to the movie soundtrack <i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Dreams_%28Soundtrack%29_07b4.html" title="Electric Dreams (Soundtrack)">Electric Dreams</a></i>. George and Roy Hay had already written "Love Lies Lost" for backing singer <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Terry_0d0b.html" title="Helen Terry">Helen Terry</a> and a new tune "<a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing_Friend_60e1.html" title="Passing Friend">Passing Friend</a>" for the upcoming <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_%28album%29_7c4f.html" title="The Beach Boys (album)">Beach Boys album</a> but the two Culture Club songs for <i>Electric Dreams</i>, "The Dream" and "Love is Love", was also written solely by George and Roy Hay. Moreover, the <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._P._Arnold_fdf4.html" title="P. P. Arnold">P. P. Arnold</a> song "Electric Dreams" was credited only to George and Phil Pickett who also co-wrote "Karma Chameleon"</p>
<p>By now Boy George had become a household name in many countries around the world and he was a natural choice for one of the lead vocals on the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_Aid_%28band%29_8748.html" title="Band Aid (band)">Band Aid</a> single "<a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_They_Know_It%27s_Christmas_713a.html" title="Do They Know It's Christmas">Do They Know It's Christmas</a>". Later, in 1986, he guest-starred on an episode of the <a href="../../../a/-/t/A-Team_2969.html" title="A-Team">A-Team</a> entitled "Cowboy George".</p>
<p>In late 1985, George had become addicted to cocaine. The addiction quickly evolved into a heroin addiction and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Club_0c51.html" title="Culture Club">Culture Club</a> started to lose its place musically. Their 1986 album <i><a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Luxury_to_Heartache_4f71.html" title="From Luxury to Heartache">From Luxury to Heartache</a></i> dragged on for so long that producer <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arif_Mardin_bdd2.html" title="Arif Mardin">Arif Mardin</a> had to disband the sessions and leave it up to engineer Lew Hahn to record the final vocals. Songs like "Gusto Blusto" and "Reasons" took days for George to finish. Following the release of the album, rumors of George's addiction began to circulate, and by the summer of 1986, he announced that he was indeed addicted to drugs. In July, he was arrested by the British police for possession of cannabis. Several days later, keyboardist Michael Rudetski, who played on <i>From Luxury to Heartache</i> and had co-written “Sexuality” and "What Have I Got To Lose" with George, was found dead of a heroin overdose in George's home. An American Culture Club tour was cancelled and the group had disbanded by late 1986.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_George_afef.html" title="Edit section: Solo career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Solo career</span></h3>
<p>Still battling his heroin addiction and subsequent dependence on prescription narcotics, George started recording his first solo album. In 1987, <i>Sold</i> was released and George enjoyed several hit singles including "Everything I Own" (UK#1), "Keep Me In Mind" (UK#29), "To be Reborn" (UK#13) as well as the title song (UK#24).</p>
<p>Despite UK success, George never really managed to duplicate that success in the US, especially because he was not able to come to America because of the previous year's drug charges, though he did score a moderate hit with the song "Live My Life" (#40 US) from the <i>Hiding Out</i> soundtrack. His second US album <i>High Hat</i> comprised of songs from two of his solo British albums released after <i>Sold</i>. The R&amp;B song "Don't Take My Mind On A Trip", produced by <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Riley_%28new_jack_swing%29_a8f4.html" title="Teddy Riley (new jack swing)">Teddy Riley</a>, became the only hit from <i>High Hat</i>, reaching top 5 on the R&amp;B chart.</p>
<p>His following release was a song to protest against the governing UK <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>'s legal restrictions on anyone working for a local authority <i>promoting</i> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, 'No <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_28.html" title="Section 28">Clause 28</a> (Emilio Pasquez Space Face Full Remix)' was a big underground <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_house.html" title="Acid house">acid house</a> hit.</p>

<p>In 1989, after being presented with a demo of the track 'Everything Starts with an <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.html" title="Methylenedioxymethamphetamine">E</a>' by ragamuffin artist MC Kinky of E-zee Possee, George formed his own label, More Protein. He also recorded under the name Jesus Loves You, (writing under the pseudonym Angela Dust), releasing another underground club hits "After The Love" and "Generations Of Love", and "Bow Down Mister". With "Bow Down Mister", he returned to the UK top 30 in 1991. Inspired by his involvement in the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hare_Krishna_734d.html" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishna</a> movement (<a href="../../../i/s/k/ISKCON_b180.html" title="ISKCON">ISKCON</a>), George had written the song during a trip to India and with its reminiscence of "Karma Chameleon" it was intended for the Culture Club reunion, which never came about. "Bow Down Mister" would become a signature song for Boy George but also for Culture Club during their tours in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>On Saturdays 31 March 1990 to 6 April 1991, Boy George presented a weekly chat and music show on the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Station_%28television%29_d341.html" title="Power Station (television)">Power Station</a> satellite channel called <i>Blue Radio</i>, described as <i>a three hour party with guests and games</i>.</p>
<p>In 1992, George scored a hit with a version of the song "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crying_Game_%28song%29_5b6c.html" title="The Crying Game (song)">The Crying Game</a>" (produced by the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_Shop_Boys_772d.html" title="Pet Shop Boys">Pet Shop Boys</a>), which was featured on the movie of the same name, and reached the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100. Although he'd had solo hits in the UK, this would be his first and only big US pop hit since Culture Club's 1986 single "Move Away".</p>
<p>A lot of recordings were made between 1990 and 1994, but never surfaced. A pop and world-music oriented album was scheduled for 1992, named "Popularity Breeds Contempt", but was never released. It was to be released with the pseudonym Jesus Loves You. The album was shelved in favour of the recent growing interest in rock for George.</p>
<p>He released a rock-driven <i>Cheapness And Beauty</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, but the album was not successful, although "Same Thing in Reverse" did become a minor US hit. Again, most critics were good (although some never understood the mix of acoustic ballads and country-folk tunes with aggressive glam rock tracks). It was clear that there were tensions between Virgin Records and Boy George at this time, and the album received almost no promotion.</p>
<p>A follow-up to <i>Cheapness And Beauty</i>, tentatively named "Too Spooky" was recorded in spring 1996 but shelved, especially due to problems with Virgin Records. Some of the tracks from those sessions appeared later on <i>The Unrecoupable One Man Bandit Volume One</i>, which was at first sold on internet only and then distributed by several minor labels.</p>
<p>Another project from the time was a new group that would include Boy George and two long-time musicians, John Themis and Richie Stevens. Initially named "Shallow", it was later re-named "Dubversive". The project took place in 1997 and was to include trip-hop, dub and reggae. The project was shelved, this time due to a lack of interest by record companies because of the group's lack of commercial appeal. Some songs from those sessions surfaced later on the 2002 Culture Club Box set and some others appeared on ebay in 2004.</p>
<p>On some other labels, several dance-oriented tracks were released in various countries. For example, "Love is Leaving" went top 3 in Italy and "When Will You Learn" reached the top positions in the Switzerland charts.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century, Boy George collaborated on songs with dance-oriented acts. For example, "Why Go," a slow-paced track with Faithless, from their Sunday 8 PM lp, was later released in a remixed form in some European countries and Australia. A track was done with Groove Armada, named "Innocence Is Lost", but was only released on a promo 12" in 1999.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2004, George was involved in the production of his musical "Taboo". It received some rave reviews, especially in regards to George's musical score, which contained many new songs written for the show. It was performed in London in 2002-2003 and then was taken to Broadway for one hundred performances. George was also nominated for a Tony award for "Best musical score".</p>
<p>In 2002, Boy George released <i>U Can Never B2 Straight</i>, an "unplugged" collection of rare and lesser known acoustic works. It contained unreleased tracks from previous years as well as some ballads from <i>Cheapness And Beauty</i> and the Culture Club album <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Mind_if_I_Do_50eb.html" title="Don't Mind if I Do">Don't Mind if I Do</a></i>. It received the best reviews of Boy George's solo career, many of them highlighting his strong songwriting abilities. The record was only released in the UK and Japan, and received almost no promotion from Virgin Records, only rising to 147 on the UK album charts.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2004, under the pseudonym "the Twin", Boy George experimented in electronica, releasing limited edition 7" singles and promo records. Performed in small venues such as the Nag Nag Club, the material was considered innovative, but not commercially marketable. This period, however, was a very creative and liberating one for George; for "the Twin," could sing whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>An album recorded in the Spring of 2003 was also shelved. A collaboration with electronic combo T-Total, the album was a collection of covers of songs by <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Airplane_0cc6.html" title="Jefferson Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Springfield_7baf.html" title="Dusty Springfield">Dusty Springfield</a>, <a href="../../../t/-/r/T-Rex_9fb6.html" title="T-Rex">T-Rex</a>, and the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurythmics.html" title="Eurythmics">Eurythmics</a> among others. It is suggested that Boy George's numerous abandoned projects are due to his broad interest and need to explore other creative mediums such as photography, writing, and fashion.</p>
<p>On his "More Protein" website, George did announce another unreleased album, named Straight, for summer 2005. It was to include tracks like "Panic" and "Talking Love". Fortunately, four tracks were released as a sampler with the book of the same name in 2005. A reggaeton oriented ep was also planned for August 2006 but was never released. Some recent tracks are now shared by George himself on his YouTube account, his three myspace pages and sometimes on his official site.</p>
<p>In January of 2007, Boy George released "Time Machine" on Plan A Records. "Time Machine" was co-written by double Ivor Novello Award-winning songwriter <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Ghost_73ef.html" title="Amanda Ghost">Amanda Ghost</a> who also co-wrote "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_Beautiful_f564.html" title="You're Beautiful">You're Beautiful</a>" with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Blunt_6f74.html" title="James Blunt">James Blunt</a>.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5322888.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5322888.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Australian singer <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> asked to work with George and Amanda Ghost for her upcoming album, which is set to be released in 2007. It will not be the first time that George has given songs to other artists. In the past, he shared compositions with the Beach Boys, Caron Wheeler, Charlotte Church, Mica Paris and many others. He also wrote many of the tracks for the artists on his own dance oriented music label, More Protein, such as Eve Gallagher, Zee Asha, Lippy Lou, and E-Zee Possee.</p>

The following month, the band appeared on <i>Late Night with David Letterman</i> and made an appearance in Britain, their first in 14 years. Later that year, the band had a Top 5 hit in the UK with "I Just Wanna Be Loved" and later a top 30 hit with "Your Kisses are Charity".</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the band decided to again reunite and tour; however, George declined to join them for this tour. As a result, two members of Culture Club replaced George with vocalist Sam Butcher.

<p>With George's relationship with Moss over, and with a poor reaction to the band's third album, George suffered several setbacks, and ultimately turned to drugs. This caused the downward spiral of the group, and they eventually disbanded, as George could no longer work with Moss.</p>
<p>George struggled against his severe <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> addiction for many years.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He would appear in public under the influence of the drug, and even attempted to do concerts in such a state. Addictions to other drugs followed, and George's younger brother David, in an attempt to save his famous sibling from death, went on UK national television and blew the whistle on George. Some of George's closest friends had already died of overdoses and co-writer on the <i><a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Luxury_to_Heartache_4f71.html" title="From Luxury to Heartache">From Luxury to Heartache</a></i> album, Michael Rudetsky, was found dead of a heroin overdose in George's home in August 1986.</p>

<p>When George was with Culture Club, much was made of his androgynous appearance, and there was speculation about his sexuality. When asked the question in interviews, George gave various answers. At times he suggested he was <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a>. He gave a famous, oft-quoted response to an interviewer that "I prefer a nice cup of tea to sex". <a href="http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cupoftea/biography/copy_of_tea-the-basics" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cupoftea/biography/copy_of_tea-the-basics" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>Boy George remains a figure in the public eye. Although he has not reached the same level of success as a solo artist, he has a second career as a notable music DJ. He started DJing in the early 90's and came to the attention of legendary rave/house promoters <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantazia.html" title="Fantazia">Fantazia</a> who asked him to mix 1 of the discs on the 2 volume in their new compilation series <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantazia.html" title="Fantazia">Fantazia</a> The House Collection 2. This compilation was a success in the UK, going gold. The album was also sold to Sony for European-wide release.
