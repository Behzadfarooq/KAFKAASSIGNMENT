<h2><span class="mw-headline">popular culture</span></h2>
<p>I have just added a popular culture section to this article. It seemed more appropriate to add it here than in the article about the BSA organization. If you disagree with my inclusion of pop culture, please discuss it with me here before starting an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>. <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcaps123_2c17.html" title="User:Ycaps123">Ycaps123</a> 21:10, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This has every potential to get huge. Do you know how many movies have shown or referenced Scouts? I know of one movie in development. Then there is the Cecil B DeMille screenplay based on Two Lives of a Hero that was never produced. Are we to have a section in the Cub Scout article so we can include <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_and_Derby_424e.html" title="Down and Derby">Down and Derby</a>? I have over a dozen fiction novels about Boy Scouts here in my home office. It might make more sense to have this in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_in_popular_culture.html" title="Scouting in popular culture">Scouting in popular culture</a> so that Girl Scouts could be included as well. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 02:22, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a section on <i>Scouting in film and the arts</i> in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a>. This really should get tied together instead of spread out. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 03:17, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This would also be a good place for the Fictional section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>. That section has always bugged me, and I started it. I knew someone had a list of Scouting related movies, but it has been greatly expanded since I last looked <a href="http://usscouts.org/profbvr/scoutfiction/start.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://usscouts.org/profbvr/scoutfiction/start.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 12:19, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ISCA Journal had an article on all the old films that dealt with Scouting. I can look it up once this is settled. I propose a separate article for this, linked from wheverer we want. Also, putting it in the BSA article cuts out the Scouting movements from othere countries. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 12:32, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I see that there is a pop culture section in the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA_835b.html" title="Girl Scouts of the USA">Girl Scouts of the USA</a> article. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 13:42, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes... I added the pop culture section to the girl scouts article. I think that it is a FANTASTIC idea to have one article on scouts of both sexes in pop culture. Maybe this will indeed explode in such huge proportions as to need a dedicated article. I say that we create a dedicated article now -- we can always merge it later if need be. <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcaps123_2c17.html" title="User:Ycaps123">Ycaps123</a> 18:05, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a (now a little dates) article at the US Scouting Service project listing scouting related movies (and I think TV shows). I actually think that a dedicated article, covering either Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts or both, would be best, rather then a section in this article or the main BSA article. When you stop to think of the movies with some kind of scouting theme (boy, cub, girl, etc), then the tv shows, (I can think of several episodes of series like South Park, Simpsons, Family Guy, etc, that have had a scout theme), you can cover a lot. --<a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmb021_1dab.html" title="User:Emb021">Emb021</a> 03:13, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for creating the article, I might have gotten to it eventually. But I'm a procrastinator -- so perhaps not.&#160;:~) In any case, since all of the info seems to be in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_in_popular_culture.html" title="Scouting in popular culture">Scouting in popular culture</a> now, I have replaced the original info in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA#Popular_Culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA#Popular_Culture" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)#Popular_Culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)#Popular_Culture" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] with with a quick summary.

<dd>Yes is is. Generally you can take the lead-in from the main article and use it as a section in another article with a link to the main. It's actually a rather fun article to work on when my brain gets tired of working on the other stuff. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 14:23, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chartered organization</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the claim that the chartered organization selects "leadership." As far as I know, troop leadership comes from the committee, which consists of anyone who cares to join. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 01:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Technically, not just anyone can be a leader: the chartered organization is responsible for the committee. This is how it is supposed to work, but I won't claim that this always reflect reality. See <a href="http://www.scouting.org/relationships/04-113/03.html" class="external free" title="http://www.scouting.org/relationships/04-113/03.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scouting.org/relationships/04-113/03.html</a></p>
<p>Chartered Organization Responsibilities</p>
<p>By receiving a charter from the Boy Scouts of America, the chartered organization agrees to (List the following on a flip chart.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct Scouting in accordance with its own policies and guidelines as well as those of the BSA.</li>
<li>Include Scouting as part of its overall program for youth and families.</li>
<li>Appoint a chartered organization representative who is a member of the organization and will represent it to the Scouting district and council, serving as a voting member of each.</li>
<li>Select a unit committee of parents and members of the organization who will screen and select unit leaders who meet the organization's leadership standards as well as the BSA's standards.</li>
<li>Provide adequate and secure facilities for Scouting units to meet on a regular schedule with time and place reserved.</li>
<li>Encourage the units to participate in outdoor experiences.</li>

<dd>That's interesting. I don't recall my old troop ever getting anything from its chartered organization (aside from the keys to the meeting place) or giving much back. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 02:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It depends a lot on the CO and the COR. Our current CO gives us $200 per year, signs the charter and that's about it- our meeting place actually has no connection to the CO. In a previous troop, the guy who became the COR (essentially the CEO of my company) a) approached me about switching the charter b) provided anything we needed - trucks, rope, free vacation for camp, etc. When I originally wrote that chunk of the article, I wrote it to that standard. BTW: it used to match the same section in the Cub, Varsity and Venturing articles.--<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 03:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hmmmm this seems to be a problem. Everybody with half decent knowledge of the BSA either is A. Part of the organization and is therefor biased or B.

<p>I suppose that stating that everyone is biased in some manner is a tautology. What do you suggest? When this article goes up fro GA or FAC it will be checked for NPOV.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merge</span></h2>
<p>Previously on Wikipedia. Back in March of 2006, we had a consensus to merge the Cub Scouting and the Boy Scouting advancement articles as I have proposed below. These merges were made and the links and redirects fixed. In June 2006, <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060606200501&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Cool_Cat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060606200501&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Cool_Cat" rel="nofollow">unilaterally reverted</a> all of these changes. There was a lot of discussion and acrimony, and we left it as it was.</p>
<p>It is now almost a year since the original merges and the articles in question have stood as stubs since then, with only a few minor edits. I now propose to reinstate those merges. These merges are effectively already done, as the information was moved back in March.</p>
<p>Merge these articles into <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_402c.html" title="Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)">Boy Scouts</a></p>

<dd><b>Response</b>: As noted, the merge is effectively done and has been for almost a year.

<li>in that case, I will <b>support</b> the proposal... to be honest, I thought the discussion was about the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> international article rather than the BSA specific one when I followed the link from the project page, which was why I made my suggestion... if the information from the other articles is already in the Boy Scout (BSA) article, then there's not really much point in having the same information spread in different articles... <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorus_Kol_b6de.html" title="User:Horus Kol">Horus Kol</a> 01:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The controversy section is in the parent <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> article. If we include the controversy section in the Boy Scout article, then we would need to include it in the Cub Scouts, Varsity Scouts, Venturing, Sea Scouts and Order of the Arrow articles. We now have to keep the two articles synchronized as editors make changes to one but not the other, but eight is a bit much. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 17:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Is the controversy really relevant to Cub Scouts, Varsity Scouts, etc. though?

<p>The controversies are indeed relevant to all of the BSA programs, but at the National level. That is, the policies are developed by National and the membership programs comply.

<dd>Kari-Nope, the controveries apply to all of BSA, not just the troop level. So, I have to agree with Gadget850, the controversies setup should stay the way it is, with the summary in the BSA article and a link to a main article from there with see also links elsewhere. I do think the request of more refs is legit and as for photos, nice probably, but that alone should not hold up a GA nom. We'll work on more refs. The article should have been put on GA Hold, not turned down outright.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 21:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
