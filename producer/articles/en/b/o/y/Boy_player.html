<p>The troupes of boy actors prominent in the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_era.html" title="Elizabethan era">Elizabethan</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobean_era.html" title="Jacobean era">Jacobean</a> periods, whom <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> famously called "little eyases" in <i><a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>,</i> II, ii,339 (the wonderfully evocative term "eyas" actually meaning an unfledged hawk),<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> had grown out of the choirs of boy singers that had been connected with cathedrals and similar institutions since the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. (Similar boy choirs, of course, exist to this day.) Thus the choir attached to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul%27s_Cathedral_6064.html" title="St. Paul's Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> since the 12th century was in the 16th century molded into a company of child actors, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_Paul%27s_f8b1.html" title="Children of Paul's">Children of Paul's</a>. Similar groups of boy actors were connected with other institutions, including <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a>, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Merchant_Taylors_d277.html" title="Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors">Merchant Taylors</a> School, and the ecclesiastical college at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor</a>.</p>

<p>The boys were generally in the range of 8-12 years old (choirboys are pre-pubescent precisely because their voices have not yet "broken" with puberty). They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivium.html" title="Trivium">trivium</a> (grammar, logic, rhetoric), and sometimes fluent in Latin; add in a certain "cuteness factor," and the boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England. Between <a href="../../../1/5/5/1558.html" title="1558">1558</a> and <a href="../../../1/5/7/1576.html" title="1576">1576</a> (the year <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Burbage_4ae9.html" title="James Burbage">James Burbage</a> built <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Theatre_80d6.html" title="The Theatre">The Theatre</a> in London and the age of popular Elzabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lyly_6d4e.html" title="John Lyly">John Lyly</a> earned fame when his "Euphuistic" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1580s.</p>
<p>The practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). In 1590 theatrical performances by the Children of Paul's were suppressed, largely due to Lyly's involvement in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marprelate_controversy.html" title="Marprelate controversy">Marprelate controversy</a>. Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600.html" title="1600">1600</a>, however, the practice saw a resurgeance: the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_the_Chapel_7c74.html" title="Children of the Chapel">Children of the Chapel</a> performed at the private <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfriars_Theatre_385f.html" title="Blackfriars Theatre">Blackfriars Theatre</a> for much of the first decade of the 17th century. Their performances of the plays of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> were especially popular, inspiring Shakespeare's lines about how the boys "carry it away...Hercules and his load too" in <i>Hamlet,</i> II, ii,360-2. (The <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_Theatre_071a.html" title="Globe Theatre">Globe Theatre</a> was decorated with a statue of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a>, the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.</p>
<p>The children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the <i>Poetomachia</i> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Theatres_1397.html" title="War of the Theatres">War of the Theatres</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/1599.html" title="1599">1599</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/0/1601.html" title="1601">1601</a>). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Marston_0c19.html" title="John Marston">John Marston</a>'s <i><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Drum%27s_Entertainment_f68b.html" title="Jack Drum's Entertainment">Jack Drum's Entertainment</a></i> (1600) and <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_You_Will_311d.html" title="What You Will">What You Will</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/6/0/1601.html" title="1601">1601</a>) and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Dekker_0840.html" title="Thomas Dekker">Thomas Dekker</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Satiromastix.html" title="Satiromastix">Satiromastix</a></i> (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's <i><a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynthia%27s_Revels_8c36.html" title="Cynthia's Revels">Cynthia's Revels</a></i> (1600) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Poetaster_6a08.html" title="The Poetaster">The Poetaster</a></i> (1601).</p>
<p>The boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Middleton_4ab2.html" title="Thomas Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>, which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman "wits," in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Heywood_4892.html" title="Thomas Heywood">Thomas Heywood</a> that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Chapman_cdb7.html" title="George Chapman">George Chapman</a>—<i><a href="../../../b/u/s/Bussy_D%27Ambois_5c25.html" title="Bussy D'Ambois">Bussy D'Ambois</a>,</i> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Revenge_of_Bussy_D%27Ambois_2753.html" title="The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois">The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</a></i>, and the double play <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Conspiracy_and_Tragedy_of_Charles%2C_Duke_of_Byron_b723.html" title="The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron</a></i>. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.</p>
<p>The brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastward_Ho_0b4f.html" title="Eastward Ho">Eastward Ho</a></i>, which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By 1606 the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Elizabeth%27s_Men_3ef2.html" title="Lady Elizabeth's Men">Lady Elizabeth's Men</a> was a new company granted a patent on April 27, <a href="../../../1/6/1/1611.html" title="1611">1611</a>, under the patronage of King James' daughter <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_of_Bohemia_d233.html" title="Elizabeth of Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a>; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.</p>
<p>While controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, Richard Gunnell attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salisbury_Court_Theatre_b09a.html" title="Salisbury Court Theatre">Salisbury Court Theatre</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1629.html" title="1629">1629</a>. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hammerton_8f71.html" title="Stephen Hammerton">Stephen Hammerton</a>, who went on the act with the King's Men, and became an early matinee idol among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1637.html" title="1637">1637</a>, when <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Beeston_5a4d.html" title="Christopher Beeston">Christopher Beeston</a> established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeston%27s_Boys_3832.html" title="Beeston's Boys">Beeston's Boys</a>. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors—much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, his son <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Beeston_7942.html" title="William Beeston">William Beeston</a> continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_comedy.html" title="Restoration comedy">Restoration</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_player.html" title="Edit section: Boys in Adult Companies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boys in Adult Companies</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_company.html" title="Playing company">playing companies</a> of adult actors, boys were the performers of female roles, in an age when it was considered unacceptable for women to act. Female roles were performed by boys from the beginnings of professional English theatre (in the 1560s) to the closure of the theatres in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>. Upon the restoration of theatre in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>, boys were initially utilized but by about <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> women were permitted to act on the stage.</p>
<p>There was no law against women on stage: English Renaissance audiences seem to have simply considered it unthinkable, since no one ever argued in favor of it in the period. The social assumptions and biases involved were so strong as to go unquestioned at the time. Pre-pubescent boys were used because their high-pitched voices sound more like women.</p>
<p>Boy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms—perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.)<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men. In reference to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> company, variously the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Men_4a27.html" title="Lord Chamberlain's Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/1594.html" title="1594">1594</a>–<a href="../../../1/6/0/1603.html" title="1603">1603</a>) or the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Men_%28playing_company%29_7524.html" title="King's Men (playing company)">King's Men</a> (1603 and after): Augustine Philips left bequests to an apprentice, James Sand, and a former apprentice, Samuel Gilburne, in his will, read after his death in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1605.html" title="1605">1605</a>; company members <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ostler_2898.html" title="William Ostler">William Ostler</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Underwood_6fae.html" title="John Underwood">John Underwood</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Field_1143.html" title="Nathaniel Field">Nathaniel Field</a>, and John Rice had all started their acting careers as Children of the Chapel at the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfriars_Theatre_385f.html" title="Blackfriars Theatre">Blackfriars Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>One question has persisted: did boys play <i>all</i> female roles in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Renaissance_theatre_df95.html" title="English Renaissance theatre">English Renaissance theatre</a>, or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakepeare</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Webster_a4ce.html" title="John Webster">Webster</a> could have been played by "children." The available evidence is maddeningly incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; yet the overall implication is that women were played by boys, not men. An example: John Honeyman started playing female roles for the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Men_%28playing_company%29_7524.html" title="King's Men (playing company)">King's Men</a> at the age of 13, in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1626.html" title="1626">1626</a>, in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Massinger_b784.html" title="Philip Massinger">Philip Massinger</a>'s <i>The Roman Actor</i>. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodowick_Carlell_eff5.html" title="Lodowick Carlell">Lodowick Carlell</a>'s <i>The Deserving Favorite</i> and Massinger's <i>The Picture</i> (both in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1629.html" title="1629">1629</a>). Yet in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1630.html" title="1630">1630</a>, at the age of 17, Honeyman switched to young male leads and never returned to female roles. Honeyman's predecessor in the King's Men in the 1620s, John Thompson, appears to have played women for a decade or so (though not for two decades).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Audience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform <i><a href="../../../o/t/h/Othello.html" title="Othello">Othello</a></i> at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, "She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as "she," when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.</p>
<p>The best answer to this question, "boys or men in female roles?," may be, both or either, depending upon the actor and the role. A 40-year-old comic actor could perhaps have played Mistress Quickly in Shakespeare's Falstaff plays—but not Juliet, or Ophelia, or Desdemona. Honeyman may have stopped played female roles at age 17 because he had grown too tall, or because his voice was too deep. Could a child have played Shakespeare's Cleopatra or Webster's Vittoria Corombona? That would depend on the child; <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Terry_20da.html" title="Ellen Terry">Ellen Terry</a> called <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Olivier_615b.html" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> "already a great actor"...when he was twelve years old.</p>

<p>Many <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed to encourage homosexual lust.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Beeston_5a4d.html" title="Christopher Beeston">Christopher Beeston</a> was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Field_1143.html" title="Nathaniel Field">Nathaniel Field</a> was another success story of the children's companies. In <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartholomew_Fair_3ee7.html" title="Bartholomew Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a></i>, Jonson hailed him as the "best" of the young actors ("Which is your best actor, your Field?"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.</li>
