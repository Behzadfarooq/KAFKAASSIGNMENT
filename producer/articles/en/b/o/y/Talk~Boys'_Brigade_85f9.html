<p>There's no article for the Girls' Brigade! I am scandalised! Helen.</p>
<pre>
- Well... write one!  That's what it's all about!
</pre>
<p>Just a note: I altered the description of the Staff Sergeant's stripes based on personal experience and my copy of the Brigade Uniform Regulations. Staff Sergeants wear their stripes point up level with the bottom of their right shirt sleeve, in distinction to other non-commissioned ranks who wear theirs pointing down on the upper right arm.

<p>I've done a fairly thorough proof-read and edit of the whole article - some grammar fixes and sentence structure improvements. Also started trying to split the article into sections but I think more work is needed on the "History" part. As a Junior section leader, I've also updated the description of the awards scheme. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a> 22:26, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The external links list is getting rather too long - Wikipedia is not supposed to be a links repository! I'm afraid this probably means removing the links for individual companies, on the basis that there is no reason to provide links for these companies and not others, and it would be unfeasible to provide links to all companies. (It is perhaps also worth noting that the vast majority, if not all, of these links has been added by anonymous users.) I'd suggest that links are only provided to the national BB organisations and that there is then no need to have country sub-headings. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a> 22:26, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This old chestnut is a perennial discussion. the suffix "ize" is not an American trait. Most words in British English that end with this suffix can be "ise" or "ize" (there are some exceptions as there are words that should end in "ise" in American English. In fact the OED prefers the use of "ize" as do many accademic sources. <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. "ise" in British/commonwealth English seems to have crept into use more over the course of the latter twentieth century (find any old English dictionary and you will srtuggle to find "ise"). It has reached such ubiquity outside accademic circles that many British/Commonwealth readers often mistake the "ize" as Ameircan. Most dictionaries now list both suffixes as acceptable in British English, but if we are writning an international project and we have a choive it makes sense to use the spelling that would be usiversally acceptable to all English Speakers and matches other existing links (IMO the rule should also apply to examples such as <b>Gaol</b> and <b>Jail</b> in British English and <b>Ketchup</b> and <b>Catsup</b> in American English). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 13:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im sorry, the BB is not part of the scouts, because it is older than the scouts and therefore should have its own WikiProgect for the Brigades as it is known to members of it.</p>

<p>Baden Powell was inspired by his friend William Smith's creation of the Boys' Brigade and was involved at ealry stage (I need citations here and will find some) Hence the Boy's Brigade is integral to the creation of scouting. In the early part of the twentieth century there were boy;s brigade scouts, although they were a parrallel development to Baden-powell's scouts not a precursor. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 11:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Seeing as the BB is an global movement with different rules, structures, etc. in different countries, wouldn't it make sense to have national articles?</p>

<p>Pleased to see that someone has removed all of the company links from this article. If you are thinking of adding such a link please DO NOT - if one company is linked then potentially ALL must be linked and it is not the purpose of Wikipedia to be a links repository. Links I have removed a link to a New Zealand company that had been re-added and added some hidden comments relating to what should not be added, and put a note in the section about where to find links to companies. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a> 13:56, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why remove the links&#160;? They could (probably should) be removed into a seperate article that lists companies, either with external links or with stubs. If every little hamlet in the world and youth team footballer is worth a stud then surely most BB companies are also&#160;? <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackerjack_192d.html" title="User:Hackerjack">Hackerjack</a> 20:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>I think removing the links and avoiding a collection of stubs makes sense. Our primary reason for publishing on Wikipedia is to let others -- especially non-Brigadiers -- know what the BB is. Presentation is important in helping them efficiently understand the history and nature of the BB.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, we can make a stub for each company, but I think readers would likely get frustrated by the countless times they're presented with an article stating only, "The n-th Somewhere Company was founded in <i>this year</i> at <i>this place</i> by <i>this person</i>." Of course, if someone has "special" information about a company (e.g. Company X started a tradition which is now observed worldwide), then that should certainly be made known.</dd>

<dd>The <a href="http://www.boys-brigade.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.boys-brigade.org/" rel="nofollow">BB Directory</a> maintains a list of companies; We can point this out on the articles. I think maintaining a huge list in Wikipedia would be overwhelming... A casual reader would not click on all of them, and a person who's looking for a specific company would be better off searching the Directory.

<p>The global nature of the BB movement makes it extremely difficult to have a unified system. I think this should be kept in mind when adding to the article.</p>
<p>My last edit to the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boys%27_Brigade_11b0.html#Leadership" title="Boys' Brigade">Leadership</a> section is based on what I know about the Malaysian, Australian and British BB hierarchy. From my (limited) research, Colour Sergeant and Drum Major are not NCO ranks (see <a href="http://www.boys-brigade.org.uk/leaders/library/regs/regs.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.boys-brigade.org.uk/leaders/library/regs/regs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boys-brigade.org.uk/leaders/library/regs/regs.htm</a>) so I have removed them.</p>
<p>I am aware of the possibility that other countries might have adopted their own system though. If this is the case, please indicate this in your edit.</p>
<p>Another possibility to consider is that a company might have made their own changes which are not in accordance to their national regulations. It's happened before (see paragraph 8 in <a href="http://members.aol.com/bbashhton/spelt.html" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/bbashhton/spelt.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/bbashhton/spelt.html</a>) so please be careful!</p>

<p>In my last edit, I removed the mentions of the Geneva cross and the Red Cross to simplify the sentences. Does anyone think this might be an issue?</p>
<p>I have a hunch that the Boys' Life Brigade derived its emblem from that of the Red Cross movement, but have no proof or disproof. Does anyone have any info on this? <a href="../../../a/x/f/User%7EAxfangli_bc73.html" title="User:Axfangli">Axfangli</a> 13:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
