<p>I suggest we merge <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">boyfriend</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">girlfriend</a> into one article called <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">sweetheart</a>. The two articles are very similar and look something like dictionary definitions. Here are a few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article titles <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">Boyfriend</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> will both survive as re-directs.</li>
<li>The article title for an alternate meaning, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart_%28company%29.html" title="Sweetheart (company)">Sweetheart (company)</a>, will not change, and we can still have a link to it at the top of the merged article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any objections?? 66.245.98.79 18:47, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me see how this is to be done. This is what seems just about right:</p>
<p>First, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">Sweetheart</a> is to be deleted. Then, <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> is to be moved to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">Sweetheart</a> using the "Move this page" option and then reworded so that it can talk about the two genders equally. Note that <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> will be kept as a re-direct. Next, <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">Boyfriend</a> is to be merged and re-directed to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">Sweetheart</a> as well. After that, besides having a link to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart_%28company%29.html" title="Sweetheart (company)">Sweetheart (company)</a> at the top of the merged aritcle, anything else to do?? <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.245.64.202.html" title="User:66.245.64.202">66.245.64.202</a> 19:45, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two comments: 1) Moving two pages that have names that are universally used to refer to two concepts to a page with a name only used in the US is a bad idea. (I (in the UK) have never heard anyone's boyfriend or girlfriend referred to as a "sweetheart".) 2) As the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">girlfriend</a> article points out, one of its meanings is not romantic at all, and so does not belong on a page called <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">sweetheart</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:19, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The obvious answer is to expand this article. (Some ideas off the top of my head: Is "boyfriend" used differently by men and women, or by children and adults? At what point in a relationship does it start being used? Is a certain level of intimacy implied by its use? Is it used for people in long-term relationships, or are other terms like "partner" introduced after a certain period of time? Is it a modern term, and if so what would have been used before it?) Merging is normally for articles that show no potential for development, which I don't think applies here. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:34, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reply doesn't address the question. In what way is what you propose going to untangle the edit histories? What do you want to end up with in the way of redirects, articles <b>and their histories</b>, and why is this an improvement on the simple cut-and-paste approach?</p>
<p>Cut-and-paste isn't always wrong. It's always wrong as an alternative to a simple move, but this one is anything but simple. If the articles and histories are all to be kept, there's some advantage in not moving the histories. The goal is that people coming to it later will be able to work out what happened, and the <a href="../../../k/i/s/KISS_principle_ef68.html" title="KISS principle">KISS principle</a> might well apply here.</p>
<p>If you <b>do</b> want to untangle the histories somehow, I suspect that the first step should be to move the current disambiguation page from <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">sweetheart</a> to sweetheart (disambiguation), and then speedy delete the resulting redirect to allow another move.</p>
<p>But I urge you first to do some more thinking about exactly what you want to end up with (both articles and histories), personally I'm not convinced that you have it worked out yet. Then see if there's consensus to do it, and again I have to flag that I'm not personally convinced that the merge is a good idea at all. I'm happy to do the speedy provided there is consensus for the plan, in fact if you'd done that without involving VfD I'd just have done it for you and left it to others to object to the article move/merge if they wished. It's a bit more complicated now!</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this seems uncooperative! I do applaud your efforts to preserve history and to simplify the article structure. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:19, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I too applaud your efforts. However, one remark--is there a better title than "sweetheart"? It seems like a very old-fashioned term, not incredibly encyclopedic. Any suggestions?

<p>How about 'lover'? Or maybe the non-dictionary parts of boyfriend/girlfriend could be moved to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimate_relationship.html" title="Intimate relationship">intimate relationship</a>, and a redirect set up? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkarp_9606.html" title="User:Johnkarp">Johnkarp</a> 07:49, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>... if you absolutely must unify them, how about as a subsection of 'romance'? There aren't any appropriate English terms for what you want, I don't think -- e.g., 'lover' almost always implies sexual intercourse, which 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend' <i>don't</i> necessarily. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EAponar_Kestrel_f91e.html" title="User:Aponar Kestrel">Aponar Kestrel</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EAponar_Kestrel_5a6f.html" title="User talk:Aponar Kestrel">(talk)</a> 00:44, 2004 Oct 12 (UTC)</p>
<p>The pages could possibly be merged, but I don't think that <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetheart.html" title="Sweetheart">sweetheart</a> is the right place for it; neither is <a href="../../../l/o/v/Lover.html" title="Lover">lover</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimate_relationship.html" title="Intimate relationship">Intimate relationship</a> seems a bit awkward but is so far the most appropriate suggestion that I've seen. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 03:57, Oct 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about creating special friend (a little cutesy/euphemistic, but not as old-fashioned as <i>sweetheart</i>). Or move the content to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">courtship</a>... again the term is a bit old-fashioned if you ask me, but "<a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating.html" title="Dating">dating</a>" (which redirects there) is the typing of relationship in which the terms <i>boyfriend</i> and <i>girlfriend</i> are most commonly used. (And <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">courtship</a> would benefit from a little attention.) <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 00:45, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's true to say that:</p>
<p>"The term is far less often used in the extended sense as its female equivalent, girlfriend, which is fairly often used by women to refer to their non-romantic female friends, as boyfriend is rarely used this way by (heterosexual) men."</p>
<p>That's maybe a bit unequal, and maybe we should use it to mean male friend of a male, but it's very very rare, in reality. It's not non-neutral to report that things aren't equal, as long as the statement is done from a NPOV, as it is. I've literally <i>never</i> heard the word "boyfriend" used in this way ever. So i've reverted the change by <b>88.108.57.87</b> which implied it was as common as the use of the female equivalent. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 17:17, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that "boyfriend" never seems to be used in a non-sexual/romantic way by pretty much any men. I'd think gay men are more likely to refer to one another jokingly as "girlfriend" than to use "boyfriend" in a non-sexual/romantic context. Can anyone provide usage of a man saying something like "yeah, I'm heading out with my boyfriends tonight." I suppose one might theoretically imagine a gay man saying something like this, although I don't think I've ever heard such a thing. I can't even begin to imagine a straight man who is a native English speaker using the term in this way. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 13:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
