<p>Before coming to Fabletown, Boy Blue was an active fighter against <a href="../../../g/e/p/Geppetto_%28Fables%29_3902.html" title="Geppetto (Fables)">the Adversary</a>. He joined the fight during the time of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Bonaparte_f92d.html" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> (whose campaigns Blue thinks were caused by some sort of "sympathetic magic" from the Fable worlds). This was at the tail end of the Adversary's campaign against the European fables, with most of them having either escaped to the mundane world, been enslaved or killed.</p>
<p>Blue fought with Colonel Bearskin's Free Company, eventually becoming the colonel's aide-de-camp. He survived "Boxen, Ruby Lake, Oakcourt, and the hellish rout at Hollyfield", among others. His last battle was a defense of the castle guarding the last portal to the mundane world. A ragtag force, including <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a> and his <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merry_Men_9acd.html" title="Merry Men">Merrie Men</a>, were to hold the fort while a single ship took as many people as possible to the new world.</p>
<p>The day before the battle, a woman who claimed to be <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Riding_Hood_f145.html" title="Red Riding Hood">Red Riding Hood</a> rode into the fort nearly dead from arrow wounds. She and Blue quickly became infatuated with each other, to the extent that she suggested that <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friar_Tuck_1f26.html" title="Friar Tuck">Friar Tuck</a> should marry them so that Blue would have a seat on the last ship. Citing his duty, he refused. Arriving for battle in the morning, he learned his new orders: he would observe the battle from a high parapet and, at the appropriate time, would use a powerful item known as the Witching Cloak to teleport himself to the ship. Fabletown needed to know what had happened, Bearskin told him, and he wanted Blue and Riding Hood to be together. Unfortunately, when Blue arrived on the ship, he discovered that Riding Hood was not there. Not wanting to live without him, she had given up her spot and stayed behind.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Blue_%28Fables%29_5d76.html" title="Edit section: Fabletown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fabletown</span></h3>
<p>Boy Blue serves as Snow White's office gopher and clerk. His monkey Bufkin is Fabletown's librarian. Blue is one of Fabletown's most skilled musicians; he takes his horn with him everywhere. He will occasionally try to get gigs in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlem.html" title="Harlem">Harlem</a> jazz and blues clubs, but is always told that he is too young, too white or "too hayseed". His roommate is <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio_%28Fables%29_c686.html" title="Pinocchio (Fables)">Pinocchio</a>; the two of them, along with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#Flycatcher" title="List of characters in Fables">Flycatcher</a> are best friends. Blue seems to live a typical "nerdy" lifestyle, avidly reading comic books and playing board games. He wears <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars_9590.html" title="Chuck Taylor All-Stars">Chuck Taylor All-Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Blue's life changed after Red Riding Hood suddenly appeared in Fabletown, claiming to have recently escaped the Adversary. She was initially angry at Blue, claiming that he had abandoned her to the Adversary's forces. However, she soon sought him out and said she was sorry and wanted to resume their relationship. After a sexual encounter, he realized that she was not the Riding Hood he remembered (it transpired that she was <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#Baba_Yaga" title="List of characters in Fables">Baba Yaga</a> using Red's form as a mystical disguise). Along with three wooden soldiers, she interrogated him under severe torture for several days, breaking all his fingers, before having the soldiers deliver him, along with a message from the Adversary, to the Woodlands business office.</p>
<p>Against Snow's objections, Blue had <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#Dr._Swineheart" title="List of characters in Fables">Dr. Swineheart</a> patch him up and bind the <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorpal_Sword_34b8.html" title="Vorpal Sword">Vorpal Sword</a> to his hand so that he could fight in the Battle of Fabletown where he was injured by gunfire. Dr. Swineheart continued to rehabilitate him, doing so good a job that Blue was able to play his horn again.</p>
<p>With the election of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#Prince_Charming" title="List of characters in Fables">Prince Charming</a> as mayor, Blue resigned from the government. One night, he abruptly left for the Homelands, taking the Vorpal Sword, the Witching Cloak and Pinocchio's body. Using the full capabilities of the Witching Cloak (it provided impregnable armor; could not be burnt, stretched or ripped; and allowed a large degree of shape-shifting), Blue cut a swath of destruction across the Homelands. He killed thousands of soldiers, killed and impersonated multiple governors (always ordering his underlings to lower tax rates), slew a dragon through cleverness and guile, and defeated the three knights of the Rus. The knights were magically connected to Baba Yaga; the fact that their decapitated heads kept talking alerted Blue to the fact that she was still alive and a prisoner of Fabletown.</p>
<p>During the Emperor's bimonthly public address, Blue impersonated a peasant sweeping in front of the throne. This got him close enough to decapitate the Emperor. But before he could escape, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#The_Snow_Queen" title="List of characters in Fables">the Snow Queen</a> encased him in a block of ice. He woke up without any of his magical equipment, imprisoned in Geppetto's cabin and soon (in exchange for Pinocchio's body) learned the full story behind the Empire's rise. Geppetto also promised to bring him Riding Hood, but this brought a nasty shock: the version Blue had known at the castle had been another copy of the original, who had no idea who he was. A heartbroken Blue called the Witching Cloak to him and slew Geppetto's guards, before he made his escape back to Fabletown (along with Riding Hood).</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the Fabletown community (which thought Blue had stolen its valuable magical devices), Blue had been on a mission from Prince Charming. In addition to its other properties, the Witching Cloak had infinite storage space. Blue emptied every library in the Homelands, bringing Fabletown hundreds of volumes of intelligence. Unfortunately, this could not be made public, so Blue had to stand trial. He was sentenced to two years of hard labor at the Farm, Fabletown's upstate annex for non-human looking Fables. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Fables_a0f9.html#Rose_Red" title="List of characters in Fables">Rose Red</a>, the Farm's administrator, considered him a hero, and thus defined "hard labor" in very loose, general terms. Blue was last seen leading the construction of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigby_Wolf_f202.html" title="Bigby Wolf">Bigby's</a> house in Wolf Valley and serving as Bigby's best man when he married Snow. There has been hints in recent issues that Blue and Rose Red are getting romantically attached to eachother.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Blue_%28Fables%29_5d76.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Despite his calm exterior, Blue has a flint-hard personality. His years as a soldier have given him an appreciation for the importance of discipline. He strongly believes that order is important for any functioning society, and that this separates Fabletown from the mundane world. He has no tolerance for people (such as Prince Charming) who make decisions without considering the consequences.</p>
