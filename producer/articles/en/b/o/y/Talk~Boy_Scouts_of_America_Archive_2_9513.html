<p>The first mention of Baden-Powell in this article is buried parenthetically in the following sentence, without a first name, and without a link: In warfare using simple weapons (practiced in the medieval period, as well as by the Ashanti people who Baden-Powell met in West Africa), a warrior carries a shield in his left hand.</p>

<p>The article "Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America" was recently rewritten.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Please take a look at it and provide any comments on the article's Talk page.--<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 19:49, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can't have your cake and eat it, too, Rlevse. If saying that the BSA participates in lies and bigotry isn't NPOV, then neither is saying that it promotes good citizenship, etc. And claiming that my edit "cut key program elements" does not justify deleting the additional information in the controversy section. I edited the parts that I considered NPOV. You just deleted what you claimed was NPOV.--69.107.97.36 19:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is verifiable that the BSA promotes citizenship training. No question there. I guess you have a problem with the word "good." Perhaps something to be addressed. However, I don't think that anybody is trying to hide that there is controversy, just collect the discussion of it in a single usable, referenced place. I looked carefully at Rlevse's edits, and he is right - everything that he removed is covered in adequate detail on the controversies page. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 19:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made the last edits to the controversy section. The section here is a <b>summary</b> of the main <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies_32d9.html" title="Boy Scouts of America membership controversies">Boy Scouts of America membership controversies</a> article. If you want to add relevant details to that article, your are welcome to do so. The summary here had aquired a lot of word creep and had not been updated to reflect the main article in quite a while. Thank you for helping us notice that. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 19:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry about the mistaken ID. Forgot who it was. I have rv'ed the article and edited the various sections in question to be more NPOV. There may be some further minor edits required, but it looks much more consistent now. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 20:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is completely inappropriate to claim that the BSA promotes good citizenship while failing to mention that it participates in vicious lies against its opponents. Either the praise should be deleted, or its duplicity should be included. Putting all the praise in the main article and shuffling all the criticism off to another page is not NPOV. <b>This unsigned comment was made by 69.107.97.36</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems you are now taking issue with the definition of promote. I am intending the meaning: "urge the adoption of, advocate for." And I also notice that you have include the POV phrase "good citizenship" where I tried to change that to a more NPOV statement consistent with the BSA's published and stated goals (which establishes verifibility), eg. citizenship training. I think that the page at present is headed towards a factual, NPOV statement of what the program intends or purports to accomplish. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 20:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, if you really believe that the BSA participates in spreading damaging lies about people, you might have a good libel case in your future, however, it makes one wonder: What side of the case will you be on? --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 20:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would not be considered to have standing. I notice that no one has challenged the factual basis of my claims. Unless bsalegal is not, in fact, run by the BSA, it's an objective fact that the BSA is a dishonest organization. Its actual actions are more relevent than its "stated goals".--69.107.97.36 21:12, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I changed the controversy section because it was getting a lot of verbage creep. It is supposed to be a summary of the main controversy article. Again, if you have relevant, verifiable details, please add them where they belong. At this point, please take this to arbitration if you feel that we are wrong. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 02:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>69.107.97.36--you're being even more POV than you're accusing us and this article of being. One of the reasons the controversies have their own article is that it became such a big section here that it warranted it's own separate article; and that is SOP on wiki. You should be glad all that space is devoted to it and that it's a Featured Article. Look in the mirror more closely.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 21:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What does "more POV" mean? According to the guidelines, "A POV fork is an attempt to evade NPOV guidelines by creating a new article about a certain subject that is already treated in an article, often to avoid or highlight negative or positive viewpoints or facts. This is generally considered unacceptable. The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Points of View on a certain subject are treated in one article." But if you want me to start a new article, fine. The other article is NOT devoted to the issues that I am bringing up; LYING about discriminating against gays &amp; atheists is completely separate from discriminating against gays &amp; atheists, and it should be prominantly mentioned. By the way, it's spelled "its".--69.107.97.36 04:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The controversies article is not a POV fork, it's a full fledged article and a Featured Article, with a section, main link, and summary in this article. The BSA openly admits it doesn't accept gays and atheists, so I don't see how that is lying. I'll gladly continue this here on the talk page more if you like. Let's please work this out here first rather than continued edit battles. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 10:04, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The POV fork issue was well discussed when it was decided to create the controversies article before it ate the main BSA article. You can look through the archives on both talk pages for the discussion. Bottom line: the statements you added were uncited and unsupported, thus they do not belong. The statements you removed are referenced, thus they do belong. The controversy section here did need to be cleaned up, and that's done (this whole article still needs a lot of work, but thats another issue). Again– if you have relevant and supportable information, please add it. It would also be nice if you used the edit summary to note your changes. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 10:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The BSA openly admits it doesn't accept gays and atheists, so I don't see how that is lying." I've explained quite clearly how the BSA lies.</p>
<p>"Bottom line: the statements you added were uncited and unsupported, thus they do not belong." Can't make up your mind, can you? First they were deleted because they "weren't NPOV", now they were deleted because they are uncited. Isn't the normal practice, when one has concerns about whether something has been cited, to mention that in the talk pages, rather than simply use it as a pretext to delete material that one does not like? The parts I deleted were NOT cited, either. Well, I'm going to take you at your word. I'm going to cite my claims, and then, according to what YOU HAVE SAID, they belong.--69.107.97.36 19:08, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Dear 69:</dd>
<dd><b>My</b> mind is well made up as <b>I</b> have never mentioned POV– indeed I have no desire to dance around the POV flagpole with you. The elements you removed are verifiable and can be cited. This article is in the process of some major revisions. I have already noted that you (and anyone else) are welcome to edit this and any other article with relevant and verifiable information. So far, you have not provided any citations that support your entries.</dd>
<dd>It appears to me that that you have a bias against the BSA. While you have the right to have your own opinions, Wikipedia articles are not the forum to disseminate them. I am finding this dialog quite tedious and I do not wish to continue. If we can't reason together then we must find alternatives.</dd>
<dd>To summarize my previous statements: <b>Cite or desist</b> --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 20:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You people complain about me deleting things without giving an explanation, yet that's exactly what you're doing. Censoring crucial information without even discussing it is completely unaccpetable. Zscout370, if you're going to delete my changes, you'd be better have a reason.--69.107.97.36 20:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"So far, you have not provided any citations that support your entries." I mopst certainly have.</p>
<p>"While you have the right to have your own opinions, Wikipedia articles are not the forum to disseminate them."

<dd>Dear 69:</dd>
<dd>It seems that you are drawing attention. The last two reverts to you edits were made by editors who have not been involved here.</dd>
<dd>May I propose a truce? Let's leave this as it is through the weekend and pick it up again next week after we all cool off. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 21:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear 69.107.97.36 - I have the sinking feeling that you are not actually interested in writing an encyclopedia. There is ample room here for those that disagree with the BSA and its policies. There is not room here for editors with an ax to grind. Please understand that none of us are interested in irrelevant, unverifiable, or inaccurate information. If you can add relevant, verifiable comments, please do. Otherwise, please stop. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 21:06, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Age" id="Age"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Age</span></h2>
<p>As is well known, when a Boy Scout or Varsity Scout turns 18, they are out of the program. Venturing is a bit different; per Venturer Application 28-303K:</p>
<p><i>Venturers registered in a crew or ship prior to their 21st birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or they reach their 22nd birthday, whichever comes first.</i></p>
<p>This is now footnoted twice in this article and once in the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venturing.html" title="Venturing">Venturing</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Scout_6a0a.html" title="Sea Scout">Sea Scout</a> articles. I'm not enthused with the use of <i>inclusive</i> here as it is heavily used in the controversies article and I don't want to get it mixed into this article. I also think it can be misconstrued: per the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inclusive" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inclusive" rel="nofollow">Wictionary</a> definition, it means "including (almost) everything within its scope" or "including the extremes as well as the area between". I'm going to pick up a Boy Scout application later today and will note the age requirements in a footnote. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 13:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro too long</span></h2>
<p>The intro section shouldn't be four paragraphs long. I'm tempted to put a heading saying "Membership divisions" after the first paragraph, but on the other hand, I don't want to hide this very important content under such a dull heading. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 04:15, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right now the article is 22K characters. Per <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> the lead-in should be 2-3 paragraphs. At 30K, the lead-in should be 3-4 paragraphs.

<dd>The policy you cite is a "general guideline," not a solid rule. Each introduction should be judged by its content. According to the policy page, an intro should "provide overview;" in other words, briefly sketch what the rest of the article will describe in detail.

<p><a name="LGBT_Rights_Opposition" id="LGBT_Rights_Opposition"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">LGBT Rights Opposition</span></h2>
<p>I removed the category tag for LGBT Rights Opposition. The BSA has no position papers on this subject (see <a href="http://www.bsalegal.org" class="external text" title="http://www.bsalegal.org" rel="nofollow">BSA Legal Site</a>), and has never filed a court brief in any court case regarding rights of LGBTs. There is no evidence that the BSA opposes "LGBT Rights." The BSA National Organization article does not belong in this category.</p>
<p>I assume this link was added because the BSA does not allow LGBT as members in the organization. Be aware that this does not demonstrate opposition to "LGBT Rights" either, as membership in a private organization, which the Supreme Court of the U.S. agrees BSA is, is a privilege, not a right (see <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=530&amp;page=640" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=530&amp;page=640" rel="nofollow">BSA v Dale</a>). --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwalker2000_e02a.html" title="User:Swalker2000">Swalker2000</a> 21:41, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No mention of mormons?</span></h2>
<p>A recent episode of <i><a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit%21.html" title="Bullshit!">Bullshit!</a></i> was devoted to the BSA, and they made it clear that mormons are practically running the BSA these days (thus the emphasis on anti-LGBT which didn't exist only a few decades ago). And yet, there's no mention of it in our article? I wonder how many families would pull their kids out of the BSA if they knew that mormons were (at least at the upper echelons) determining what their kids should believe or to what they should be exposed. --<small><b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="black">BRIAN</font></a></b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a></small></p>

<dd>I'd sure like to see some evidence of that claim. Nothing that is presented on that show, without evidence to back it up, is of any importance or concern to me or anyone I know that is involved in Scouting.</dd>

<dd>As a registered Scout leader for 8 years now, I haven't ever seen or heard anything at any of the meetings, training sessions, etc. that I have attended that makes me think that even if true, this is adversely affecting the program. And I am located in the Dallas area, near the Irving headquarters, and have met and spoken at length with several of the "upper echelon" Scout executives. This is the first time I've ever heard anything about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, there are special programming elements for mormon Scouts as there are for certain other religions/sects such as Roman Catholics. If what you say is true, why wouldn't those special progams just be integrated into the whole of the Scouting experience? --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwalker2000_e02a.html" title="User:Swalker2000">Swalker2000</a> 03:07, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this show is talking about thge large amount of support that BSA gets from the LDS church and its branches. And some has claimed that the decision to expel gay scouts is because of the pressure exerted on BSA by the notably socially conservative LDS, since the subject of sexuality and scouting was never an issue until the late 80s to the early 90s, given the fact that until that time, the "morally straight clause" has nothing to do with sexuality but rather the character of the scout. Moral panic as well as religious views has compelled the expulsion, subsequently (legally) justified by BSA v. Dale in 2000. --<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud001_1db5.html" title="User:Bud001">Bud</a> 04:33, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have been in Scouts for 40 years and have never been compelled to believe any Mormon-specific doctrine. The reason the homosexual arose in BSA when it did is the same time it became a major social issue in US society at large. The Mormon church has always been a large supporter of BSA. This article is about the BSA itself, not the many organizations (many religious denominations, VFW posts, etc) that support it. The Catholic and Jewish churches are big supporters of Scoutig too. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 10:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that the Boy Scouts of America released its first statement that excluding homosexuals from memberships in 1975 (or close to, I will have to find my source again, will update when I do). Also I wanted to say that from the very start the BSA has upheld its policy of high moral value, and that the LDS church hasn't really affected BSA policy as most of the BSA policy is virtually the same as when it was founded (again, I will find the source and list it when I find it). -Choobie</li>
<li>Yes, this article is about the BSA, but should include information about major organizations that make the BSA possible (and who thus might also be influencing BSA policies). This is only common sense. I am in favor of a table listing the amount contributed to the BSA by its top 5 or 10 supporters, and possibly a break-down of the organization's membership by various criteria (age, rank, religious affiliation, etc). This would be useful information for readers. --<small><b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="black">BRIAN</font></a></b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a></small> 21:37, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Contrary to popular belief, no BSA program or membership division features controversy or scandal as a central program element. This article spends one paragraph talking about the Explorers. It does not make sense to spend half of that paragraph talking about sexual abuse.</li>
<li>BSA's membership policies are controversial: that's a fact, not an opinion. It's a contradiction in terms to say that "some consider [them] controversial."</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Exploring</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure how to fix this, but Exploring is apparently not one of the BSA divisions. It actually is part of Learning for Life, which really isn't a division of the BSA. As far as I can figure out, it is an entirely separate entity that operates parallel to the BSA's three program divisions. See <a href="http://www.learning-for-life.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.learning-for-life.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The 2005 Annual Report <a href="http://www.scouting.org/media/reports/2005/year.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scouting.org/media/reports/2005/year.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> doesn't mention LFL or Exploring (while the 1997 report does). Hopefully someone who knows more about this can fix the recent edits. I even wonder if LFL counts as "scouting"?</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring was a BSA program from the 50s until 1998. Exploring recieved a lot of support from government agencies and it adhered to the BSA religious priciple; thus it ran afoul of the lawsuits of the era. BSA split the career oriented section of Exploring and put it under LFL. The outdoor/adventure parts of Exploring became Venturing. Exploring does belong under the BSA history section, but is not a current program. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 01:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I suggest that the word "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Theistic.html" title="Theistic">theistic</a>" be used to describe the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">BSA</a>, if not in the opening sentence, then at least in the opening paragraph. One reviewer deleted my insertion of this word, with the comment: "Scouting organizations are ALL theistic, so this one is not unique." First of all, this is not true. Please see the page regarding membership controversies to verify that there are several nontheistic scouting organizations. Furthermore, an organization that zealously polices its members by expelling those who differ from theistic beliefs deserves to be labeled with the appellation. Lastly, an attribute doesn't have to be "unique" to be part of the definition of what an organization is dedicated to. --<a href="../../../u/r/o/User%7EUroshnor_f171.html" title="User:Uroshnor">Uroshnor</a> 15:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, but the adjective <i>theistic</i> is being used to modify <i>Scouting organization</i>, so for <i>theistic</i> to be necessary, <i>Scouting organizations</i> need to come in both <i>theistic</i> and <i>non-theistic</i> varieties. Despite a few examples, this is not a prominent division among Scouting organizations. It might be appropriate for those unusual ones to be listed as <i>non-theistic</i>, but when the default is to be <i>theistic</i>, labelling the ones that are is redundant. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You created the article BSA Honesty- I added the fact tag, and an admin put it up for speedy deletion. On at least two occasions, you have added a statement at the top of this article that "This article is for positive aspects of the BSA."

<p>The other article is about the membership policies of the BSA, not the honesty policies.</p>
<p>It takes quite a stretch of the imagination to call my additions "original research". As for "POV", you have yet to explain what you mean by that term. The Wiki guidelines specifically state that</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being the truth, and all significant published points of view are to be presented, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Readers are left to form their own opinions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. It is a point of view that is neutral - that is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your comment that my cites are copied from other articles is also quite odd. A cite is, by definition, copied from the source material. That is what a cite is. And my cites clearly do have relevance to my claims. I recall putting a comment on the top of the page only once, and this claim is justified, as the controversy section is restricted to only being a summary. Finally, your repeated refusal to admit the libel that has been clearly established marks you as either being either highly self-delusional, or simply dishonest. As your "objections" are without merit, I have reverted.Heqwm 19:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I also concur with the statements by Rlevse and others. I have reverted your most recent change and also left a message on your talk page. You're most recent claim was that the organization has acted less than honestly on past occasions. First, since you provided no source, this is only your opinion or interpretation of fact and therefore could easily be considred original research. Secondly, this statement could surely be made against any individual or group. That doesn't mean that we need to go dilute all our articles with such generic statements. You seem to have some sort of axe to grind and Wikipedia is not the place for that. If this sort of behavior continues, it could be grounds for blocking in the future. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 19:36, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Johntex, if you're going to just make statements that are flatout wrong, I don't see any point in trying to have a discussion with you. Go back and look at the edits that you reverted. As for the rest of your comment, that makes no sense. I never claimed that either cite is for a site that directly states that the BSA is dishonest. If I have a cite of the BSA saying X, and also a cite of the BSA saying not X, is it "original research" to note that fact? If we're going to play the cite game, I could delete 90% of this article. Do you really want to go down that road?</p>
<p>Rlevse: It is not my "opinion". It is objective fact that the BSA published lies. Also, if you want to discuss this with me, how about writing substantive comments? "Ax to grind" is simply a deprecatory phrase conveying no real meaning.</p>
<p>Gadget: Writing something as an op-ed doesn't give one license to write whatever one wants. And what relevance is it how old something is? The "good turns" section, besides being questionable from a NPOV standpoint, largely concerns things decades old.</p>
<p>A question for you people: after 9/11, Jerry Falwell blamed liberal, homsexuals, atheists, etc. Where does that fact belong? A) It was prompted by 9/11, so it belongs in the 9/11 article. B) It was made by Falwell, so it belongs in the Falwell article. C) It belongs in both. D) It's just an "ax to grind", so it doesn't belong anywhere. Heqwm 20:41, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I want to assume good faith but you are making it very difficult. I will try one more time, as perhaps we are not communicating well.

Therefore, it is an unsourced statement. If you somehow think that you did include a citation, then please explain what the word "citation" means to you - because I'm not seeing one in your edits. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:59, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In other words, you've redefined "cite" to suit your needs. A cite is a reference to a source.

</dd>
<dd>Hi Heqwm. I was one of the contributes to the membership controversy article. Let me take a stab as saying why your last edits are getting reverted. It's not that the point you're trying to make is wrong: "BSA is a religious organization in one case, but not in another, and therefore hypocritical". That might be a valid point to make. The problem is it's not up to us, as Wikipedia editors, to make be making points. So, when you've been accused of original research, what've you done is take known facts and put them together to form a novel argument. That's a natural thing to do, but its something we should try to avoid, because then we're editorializing rather than reporting. What you'd be wanting here, instead, is a major source to make the same argument you're making, and then Wikipedia just has to report on that source-- not present it. It's an easy misunderstanding to have: Making a novel argument while citing pieces of evidence to support that argument ISN'T the same as "citing a source for that argument". But if you had such a source, if that source was reliable, and you could cite than source, then your edit would no longer be Original Research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other issue at hand, however, is that edits have to comply with Neutral Point of View. This is a complex thing, but one of the immediate flags that something probably not NPOV is when I can read the contribution and immediately known what the editor in question feels about an issue. If something is truly written from the NPOV, I should have a very hard time figuring out what your point is just from reading your edits. The difference between informative and persuasive writing. Both have their place, but we should be trying as hard as possible to tell ALL sides of the story, and not to persuade our readers. And your edits are pretty clearly trying to make an argument rather than just report on an argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are other problems as well. The hypocrisy you accuse BSA of is just a small part of the ongoing controversy, and that controversy is itself just a small part of the BSA. So, even if your edits could comply with the OR policy, and even if we could reword them in compliance with the NPOV policy-- I think having this much f space on the main article devoted to the hypocrisy argument would be giving it undue weight. IF we can find a good source that points out the discrepancy with the arguments made in the San Diego case and the earlier arguments made in the explusion cases, it might be worth a sentence, but it still is just one small portion of the issue that's sort of a side point. There isn't a controversy because people believe the policies are hypocritical. There is a controversy because people believe the policies are morally wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, and honestly somewhat irrelevantly since my own personal views on the merit of your argument are totally irrelevant to whether it should be included, but i'll say it anyway-- the observation you make doesn't NECESSARILY mean the BSA is being hypocritical or dishonest. Lawyers routinely make all kinds of crazy, self-contradictory arguments in the course of doing their job. There's an old law school joke they mention where a lawyer makes the argument "My client is innocent because he never owned a gun like the one that was used in the murder. And secondly, I can prove he sold that gun to someone else a month before the murder occurred". This sort of thing happens all the time. The BSA could try to argue, for example, that is a "religious organization" under the definition used in Freedom to Associate law, but NOT a "religious organization" for the purposes of "Establishment Clause" law. For example, suppose I have an informal bible study group, but not one that is registered as a Non-profit with the IRS. My groupd would be a "religious organization" under the purposes of first amendment law, but the very same group would NOT be a "religious organization" under tax law.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, if you want this aspect covered, you should look around for the biggest name you can find who talks about the discrepancy between the BSA's claim to being a religious organization in some cases, but not in others-- if it's a big deal, maybe it'd merit an observation in the membership controversy page, but I'm skeptical. In any case, I really wouldn't stress over it-- we do an extensive coverage of the whole controversy over there, and it's quite a good, mature page that I think does an excellent job of discussing the whole ball of wax.</dd>

<p>"No, I'm using "cite" in the same way as our policy, WP:CITE." You yet to present any explanation for how that page supports your claim. Simply posting a lin over and over again saying "Look! This proves I'm right" is incredibly rude. And no I see that you have deleted the POV tag, once again simply declaring me to be wrong without giving any explanation how.</p>
<p>"So, when you've been accused of original research, what've you done is take known facts and put them together to form a novel argument." No, I haven't. It's hardly a "novel" argument to mention that saying X and saying not X is contradictory. Now, I could apply this standard to the rest of the article. Do you want me to do that, or do you want to drop this line of argument? It's one or the other.</p>
<p>"If something is truly written from the NPOV, I should have a very hard time figuring out what your point is just from reading your edits." This completely ignores what "NPOV" means. It means that the <i>article</i> should be written from an NPOV, not that all edits should be from a NPOV. Furthermore, the question of who made an edit is ultimately irrelevant to whether it's NPOV. You need to make a convincing argument for why the EDIT is not NPOV, not keep making ad hominem attacks. And, again, the hypocrisy of this line of argument is flagrantly obvious. Do you have <i>any</i> trouble figuring out the point of view of the people that have <i>deleted</i> my edits? Hmmm?</p>
<p>"The hypocrisy you accuse BSA of is just a small part of the ongoing controversy". You are wrong on two counts. First, it is not small. Second, it is only tangentially part of the controversies. While the lies were <i>prompted</i> by the controversy, they are an important issue regarding the group as a whole. I have already made these arguments, and I think that it is rude for you to ignore them, and to refuse to answer my multiple choice question. And once again, hypocrisy. You people say that they belong in the other article, but when I put them there they get deleted.</p>
<p>"I think having this much f space on the main article devoted to the hypocrisy argument would be giving it undue weight." Undue space? There is an entire section devoted to praising "good turns" of the BSA, are there are multiple references throughout the article to the BSA's alleged "values". And you are complaining about four sentences that mention that one of the most prominent features of the BSA's image is false?</p>
<p>" Lawyers routinely make all kinds of crazy, self-contradictory arguments in the course of doing their job." Yes, and when was the last time you heard someone use the phrase "He's a real lawyer" as a term of phrase? The BSA have a reputation of being above such... nonstandard... ethics. I think that it is therefore important to comment on the validity of that reputation.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Heqwm (<a href="../../../h/e/q/User_talk%7EHeqwm_c65e.html" title="User talk:Heqwm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heqwm_d8fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heqwm">contribs</a>) 11:31, 2006 October 8 (UTC)</small></p>

I will no longer respond to you as I will not allow you to disrupt my contributions. -<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 21:01, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm, perhaps you did not lie, but rather are simply incredibly unobservant. Here's a link that shows that I mentioned the website: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;oldid=80172408#_note-16" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;oldid=80172408#_note-16" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America&amp;oldid=80172408#_note-16</a></p>
<p>No errors in my points have been explained, politely or otherwise. It's really quite rude to simply declare some to be unwilling to listen to reason simply because they don't agree with you. It's quite clear that by "listen to reason", you mean "do what I say", and by "moderate your position", you mean "completely abandon you position". You have made absolutely <b>no</b> effort to get me to "moderate" my position: your position is simply that my edits should be deleted in their entirety, rather than "moderated". "Compromise"? What a load of bullshit. You haven't made any effort to compromise. You started slinging around accusations of bad faith as soon as I didn't kowtow to your decrees.Heqwm 21:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You need to provide a lot more than a sentence <s>fragment</s>. The policy says "...clearly and exactly explain which part of the article does not seem to have a NPOV and why.

<p>"Sentence fragment"? Huh? It's a complete sentence. The article as a whole is not NPOV because unflattering facts are deleted. It can be improved by allowing those facts. This seems rather self-explanatory.Heqwm 21:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, it was not a fragment, I misread it. However, it certainly does not qualify as "...clearly and exactly explain which part of the article does not seem to have a NPOV and why.

<p>To date, there have been no successful attempts to document a BSA policy of dishonesty. However, if sourced, I would recommend that such a reference be included and treated in the same way as other controversies. I am not sure what "hateful actions" Heqwm is referring to, but it seems that there has been ample opportunity for discussion of positive and negative aspects of the BSA, noting a subsection and related separate article on the member controversy. I feel confident that the casual Wikipedia reader would get a balanced overall perspective on the BSA from reading this article and related sub-articles. The POV tag can be removed. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 22:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Technically, Exploring is no longer part of the BSA membership. The BSA spun off a division called Learning for Life (LfL). Exploring was moved to LfL in in 1998.
