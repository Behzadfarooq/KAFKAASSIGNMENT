<h2><span class="mw-headline">handshake</span></h2>
<p><i>The Boy Scout Handshake is the traditional shake, done with the left hand instead of the right.</i></p>
<p>Does this mean "traditional handshake"? The Boy Scout handshake isn't a normal handshake... -- <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdesham_60a4.html" title="User:Bdesham">bdesham</a></p>
<p>Never saw you defend your edit. Words in quotes are exactly what the BSA believes.</p>

<dd>By traditional handshake, he means that you shake someone's hand like you normally would, only you use your left hand instead of your right. It feels weird. Anyways, I allways thought that the reason that the left hand is used (contrary to what the article says) was because of something to do with Lord Baden Powell's expericence in Africa (I heard it at a Scoutmaster's minute like 6 years ago). I did an internet search and came up with this: <a href="http://www.lrtroop55.org/html/lord_baden-powell_.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lrtroop55.org/html/lord_baden-powell_.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lrtroop55.org/html/lord_baden-powell_.html</a> (The part I'm talking about it roughly 1/2 way down the page). So, is this true or is it just some story? Either way, I think it would be good to mention it in the article. --<a href="../../../w/c/d/User%7EWcd_c05d.html" title="User:Wcd">Will</a> 18:50, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should there be anything added about the original boy scout "Hand Clasp" that was used by the BSA before it adopted the handshake that is used today? ScooterSES 23:53, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not aware of any "hand clasp" other than the OA hand clasp, and that probably shouldn't be on the wiki anyway. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 03:41, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original BSA hand shake was know as the hand clasp and was different then the left handed handshake used today. The original hand clasp was made with the right hand and the little fingers were interlocked. It later evolved slowly into what it is today.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">rank definitions</span></h2>
<p>"The Senior Patrol Leader (SPL), and then his Assistant Senior Patrol Leader(s) (ASPL's), are the highest ranking boys in the troop. PL's and the SPL are elective positions. APL's are appointed by PL's; ASPL's are appointed by the SPL with the advice of the Scoutmaster. "</p>
<p>From my experience in scouting, SPL and APL are not nessecarily the highest ranking scouts, and ASPL's can be elected, as can APL's, depending on the troop. There is some leeway in that, it seems.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/y/e/User%7ELyellin_3af6.html" title="User:Lyellin">Lyellin</a> 05:12, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are also Junior Assistant Scoutmasters, which are usually reserved for those with Eagle rank. These may be considered higher ranking.</p>
<p>The official publications, such as Junior Leadership Training Handbook state that. I'll dig mine out and confirm... --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 06:05, 31 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll search for mine as well... *laughs*. JASMs are normally use (again, in my experience), for those kids who are Eagle, but not 18, or those who are not nessecarily around all that often, but are older, 17, 18 or so, so that they have a leadership position while not always being around. <a href="../../../l/y/e/User%7ELyellin_3af6.html" title="User:Lyellin">Lyellin</a> 15:37, Dec 31, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the <i>Junior Leader Handbook</i>:</p>
<p>SPL - "The senior patrol leader is elected by the Scouts to represent them as the top junior leader in the troop."</p>
<p>ASPL - "The assistant senior patrol leader is the second-highest-ranking junior leader of the troop. He is appointed by the senior patrol leader with the approval of the Scoutmaster."</p>
<p>APL -"The assistant patrol leader is appointed by the patrol leader and leads the patrol in his absense."</p>
<p>I guess it's official... --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 15:37, 3 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The confusion arises from the conflation of two different definitions of "rank." Perhaps a clearer wording would be "The Senior Patrol Leader (SPL), and then his Assistant Senior Patrol Leader(s) (ASPL's), are the top boy leaders of the troop." - <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 15:45, 3 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly...people allways get "ranks" and "jobs" mixed up. That being said, the SPL is usually at least a life scout and the ASPL a star. Generally, an SPL is supossed to plan things and give orders (where to set up tents and stuff like that). When it comes to being in charge, he is higher than all the other scouts , even if they have a higher rank.--<a href="../../../w/c/d/User%7EWcd_c05d.html" title="User:Wcd">Will</a> 18:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is more of a chain of command, though from my experiences, the SPL is a Life or Eagle Scout. The ASPL is a Star or higher, while the PL and APL are first class or higher. We, the troop, picked the SPL, while the SPL chose his assistant with the OK of the leaders. We tend to follow the BSA guidelines. But I do think it should be called a leadership position than rank. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 17:15, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's true. PL/APL must be First Class or higher. I believe in my troop, SPL was often Star or Life. Usually, the previous SPL was the new ASPL, but that wasn't always the case. On the rare occasion that we had an Eagle still in the troop (most of our members who earned Eagle did so at or immediately before their eighteenth birthday, making them ineligible to continue to be Boy Scouts after that), he was usually the JASM. But you're definitely right; it's a leadership position, not a rank. --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long</a> 22:30, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been a Scoutmaster for a little over 12 years and one of my early SPLs was 2nd Class, though usually they've been Star or Life. Requirements to hold the office (or any other office) are determined by the Scoutmaster, usually based on what's available. We just had elections for new Patrol Leaders and both are Second Class (should be First Class in the next month or so). So, to indicate that there are nationally recognized rank requirements for leadership positions would be far from correct. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:06, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most people who receive Eagle Scout usually leave the troop because of college or other scholing. I was asked to be an Assisant Scoutmaster after I turned 18 (I had my Eagle for a few months). I did so, but college got into the way of everything. We had a JASM in our troop, but only the Scoutmaster can choose him. One thing to also mention, I counted at least seven Eagle Scouts on Wikipedia (Jaing, Myles Long, myself, Tuff-Kat, Cavebear42, Dismas). So we start a Wiki Troop or something? <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 23:19, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hah, sure, why not? I earned my Eagle at 16. Right after I turned 16, actually. I then served as ASPL for 3 months, then as JASM for a year until I was 18. --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long</a> 14:52, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking as someone who's not <i>terribly</i> partial to the Scouts, one of the things that <b>strongly</b> impressed me about the Scout troops I have encountered, particularly one my son was in, is that they have really, truly appeared to be very broad cross-sections of the local population. The troop included Scouts from a <i>really</i> wide range of income levels, ethnicity, and religion. Planning for camping trips was truly complicated because we had to get kosher foot—<i>not</i> because of our several Jewish scouts, who didn't care, but because of a number of scouts—I'm afraid I don't know their exact ethnicity or religion, but I think they were from India—and their religion had some dietary requirements which were not exactly the same as kosher, but their parents accepted kosher as "close enough." Plans were complicated by the need to coordinate, not only with the familiar holidays and the Jewish holidays, but Eastern Orthodox holidays, Seventh Day Adventists, and I don't remember what-all.</p>
<p>Assuming this is true of Scouting in general, is there any way to document this in the article in a suitably <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> way?

<dd>Interesting. I can't say this of the Scouts in my area. Some 20-30% of the general population is of Asian origin, but the proportion in the Scout troops is much lower. Latinos also seem to be underrepresented. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> 21:02, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really think you can say this, and I'm a big fan of scouts. One thing to keep in mind is that a SIGNIFICANT portion of scouting (something like 20%? But that's off the top of my head), are Latter Day Saints. That unbalances religion very quickly IMHO. I think that individual areas may be a melting pot type, particulary in some cities (I'm thinking philly and NY here, from personal experience), but in general it's not as common. <a href="../../../l/y/e/User%7ELyellin_3af6.html" title="User:Lyellin">Lyellin</a> 07:28, Aug 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The LDS church uses BSA as a youthgroup. This does significantly sway the religious affilations as a whole. At the same time, these LDS units are not mixed with the non-LDS units. It's not like they church is saying, go join the Scouts. They are starting their own units, providing their own guidence and using BSA as an outline. Does this make the camporees, jamborees, and other multi-unit events heavily LDS? Yes. Does this in any way effect the mix of ethnic or religious affilitations in non-LDS units? No. Just observation. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 17:19, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It always impressed me as a Scout and it still surprises me today that when we're in uniform, we're all just Scouts and Scouters, not rich/poor, black/white, city/country or anything else. Units tend to reflect their communities or chartered organizations, but at the District level or at summer camp, the organization reaches and embraces all groups. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 20:50, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Texas Categorization</span></h2>
<p>Personally, other than the organization being based in Texas and in the Dallas area, do you guys think the BSA article should have been categorized in those categories? <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 17:19, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi ZScout - I added those categories. My rational is two-fold:
<ol>
<li>One of the benefits of the Wiki system in general is to provide cross-references between things that are related to each other, so that people will be able to follow an interesting voyage of discovery.</li>
<li>More specifically, I think this particular categorization makes a lot of sense. From the perspective of the Dallas Fort-Worth area, the presence of BSA headquarters is a tremendous influence on the region. Therefore, the categorization is very useful to people learning about the Dallas Fort-Worth area.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Please note by way of analogy that there is a whole sub-sub-category just for companies based in the Dallas Fort-Worth area. Since the BSA is not a company, these were the most appropriate categories to make the connection between the BSA and the area. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 17:39, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would disagree, the BSA is a company, esp when you are in reference to the national office. the bsa is not-for-profit but has employees and pays salaries, its a company in the biz sense and definatly one in the "a group of people" sense. I would say to list it under <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_based_in_Texas_aa4f.html" title="Category:Companies based in Texas">Category:Companies based in Texas</a> rather than just <a href="../../../t/e/x/Category%7ETexas_1f73.html" title="Category:Texas">Category:Texas</a> because the latter is confusing to have it sitting next to the article on the texas politics or cities. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 21:03, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that we should not have a general list of former Scouts. Out of (I'd guess) two to three hundred million boys who have grown up in the United States in the past one hundred years, one hundred million were Scouts at one time or another. Such a list threatens to immediately become egregiously long, and to contain very little useful information whatsoever.

Looking at the associated upload history for that image, its source is some random website not even affiliated with the BSA. No claim is made as to what the copyright status is, which is problematic. I am not familiar with this insignia. I don't think this is really the most frequently used insignia, is it? Can someone provide a reference for that? Can anyone come up with a better caption? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was looking also looking at that. The rank images are problematic as well. BSA does have an online guide for the use of symbols <a href="http://www.scouting.org/identity/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scouting.org/identity/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The image in question here is "On My Honor, Timeless Values" <a href="http://www.scouting.org/identity/contents/9.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scouting.org/identity/contents/9.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and is the current BSA "Strategic Plan identity" image- it has been in use for several years now. While it is used in a lot of publications, I would not say it is <i>most common</i>. "Current BSA identity emblem" would be a better description.</dd>
<dd>I do think we need to clean up the images and tags on most of the BSA articles. As far as I can tell, BSA allows usage as long as it complies with their copyright and trademark protection <a href="http://www.scouting.org/identity/contents/11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scouting.org/identity/contents/11.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. As best I can tell, the appropriate image tag would be <i>logo</i>.</dd>

<p>The new caption is much better. The image is in danger of being deleted, since it does not have a proper copyright tag.
