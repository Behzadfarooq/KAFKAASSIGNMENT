<p>The episode opens with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlo_Stanfield_d6f5.html" title="Marlo Stanfield">Marlo Stanfield</a>'s young female enforcer <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Felicia_.22Snoop.22_Pearson" title="List of characters from The Wire">Snoop</a> visiting a hardware store to replace a cordless nail gun that is continually running out of charge. The salesman recommends a powder-activated model and explains its characteristics to her. Grateful for his time and effort, Snoop pays for the tool and heavily tips the suddenly anxious salesman and walks out with the nail gun. Her mentor <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Chris_Partlow" title="List of characters from The Wire">Chris Partlow</a> waits outside in the car. Snoop cheerfully relates her new-found knowledge of their new hardware.</p>
<p>Partlow and Snoop prepare a vacant row house while a prisoner pleads with them. Partlow promises him a quick and clean death and then shoots him with a silenced pistol. They cover the body with quicklime and plastic sheets and nail the vacant building closed before they leave.</p>

<p>Councilman <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Carcetti_b001.html" title="Tommy Carcetti">Tommy Carcetti</a> has a morning meeting with a previous mayor to discuss his election campaign. Carcetti's deputy campaign manager, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Wilson_9fe5.html" title="Norman Wilson">Norman Wilson</a>, interrupts his candidate to tell him that he is behind schedule and hurries him off to his next appointment. Carcetti speaks to an indifferent group of seniors in an East side residential home.</p>
<p>Officer <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas__Herc__Hauk_8f00.html" title="Thomas &quot;Herc&quot; Hauk">Thomas "Herc" Hauk</a> reports for duty in his new post with Mayor <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Royce_1bf7.html" title="Clarence Royce">Clarence Royce</a>'s security detail. Herc finds his new partner lacking the good humor of his old one, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_Carver_c411.html" title="Ellis Carver">Ellis Carver</a>. He and his new partner see madame president <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Naresse_Campbell" title="Politicians of The Wire">Naresse Campbell</a> when waiting on Mayor Royce whom both show an immediate sexual interest in. Herc reports in to his commander, Lieutenant Hoskins. Royce declines to return a call from property developer and campaign donor <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Andy_Krawczyk" title="List of characters from The Wire">Andy Krawczyk</a>. Royce's chief of staff, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Coleman_Parker" title="List of characters from The Wire">Coleman Parker</a>, reports that Carcetti and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Anthony_Gray" title="List of characters from The Wire">Anthony Gray</a>'s campaigns are asking for two separate debates. In contrast to Carcetti, Royce has a speaking engagement with a healthy attendance at a harbor redevelopment site.</p>
<p>When Carcetti returns to his campaign offices his campaign manager <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Theresa_D.27Agostino" title="List of characters from The Wire">Theresa D'Agostino</a> orders him to begin making fundraising calls. Carcetti shirks his task and plays darts in the office with the phone off the hook. He finally begins making the calls and has some success.</p>
<p>The next day Carcetti is irritable and is disappointed with the radio spots that Wilson plays him. He gets a call informing him that Royce has spent hundreds of thousands on TV advertising. Wilson tries to divert Carcetti to thinking about his forthcoming meeting with Victorina Simmons and Reverend Garnett, both influential local figures. Carcetti views the damage drug dealers have done to the neighborhood including blocking alleyways.</p>
<p>Carcetti spends a large part of the day with the community and Wilson approves of his work. On the way to their next engagement Wilson jokes with Carcetti about which candidate he will be voting for as Carcetti worries about his race affecting voters. When Carcetti arrives he is met by an embittered and departing Tony Gray who refuses Carcetti's reconciliatory overtures.</p>
<p>Carcetti leaves the next day seeming more energized. He tells his wife <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Jen_Carcetti" title="List of characters from The Wire">Jen</a> that he is expecting a bump in the new polling data. His mood quickly turns when he learns that the polls are not moving the way he hoped. His staff remain optimistic but he believes he has already lost. When he walks out D'Agostino admits that he has read the polls accurately. Carcetti is apprehended drinking outside of a park curfew and the officer recognizes him and urges him to move on.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a> marshalls his new independent drug dealing crew. He chastises young runner <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Namond_Brice" title="List of characters from The Wire">Namond Brice</a> for not spotting a customer pulling up because he was reading. One of Bodie's colleagues, Lex, bemoans his relationship with his baby's mother, Patrice. Patrice has begun dating <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Fruit" title="List of characters from The Wire">Fruit</a>, a crew chief from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlo_Stanfield_d6f5.html" title="Marlo Stanfield">Marlo Stanfield</a>'s powerful drug dealing organization.

Bodie tells Slim Charles that business is slow since Stanfield forced his crew from Fayette Street.

Bodie expresses a desire to hit back against Stanfield and Slim Charles reminds him that he is now operating on his own. Bodie warns Lex that acting against Fruit will bring Stanfield's attention against him.</p>

Namond asks Bodie if he can leave early to get back to school equipment. Bodie ridicules Namond's academic abilities but allows him to leave on the condition that he work extra hours the following day. Bodie tells Lex that he only employs Namond because of his father's reputation.</p>
<p>Namond becomes impatient as Randy tries to trap a bird that he thinks might be a homing pigeon. Randy believes they can sell homing pigeons to Nemo, who handles Marlo's pigeon coops. Their younger friends <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Kenard" title="List of characters from The Wire">Kenard</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Donut" title="List of characters from The Wire">Donut</a> stand and look on. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Duquan_.22Dukie.22_Weems" title="List of characters from The Wire">Duquan "Dukie" Weems</a> scares off the birds by throwing a bottle. Namond initiates an argument with Dukie and Michael breaks up the fight. Randy talks to Dukie as the others leave and Dukie reveals that the bird was not a homing pigeon because it didn't have a tag on its leg.</p>
<p>That night Lex tracks Fruit and Patrice to a club. As they leave he shoots Fruit in the head and Patrice flees.</p>
<p>The following day Michael and Randy continue to try to catch pigeons. Dukie arrives having been beaten up by the children in the terraces. Namond suggests they retaliate, Randy comes up with a plan. Randy has his friends drink soda and urinate into water balloons. Namond continues to bully Dukie as they prepare. Michael incites the terrace boys by stealing a bike from them and they chase him into the ambush. The plan goes sour when Namond bursts a balloon on himself and his friends all flee. Michael is caught and gets a severe beating. Randy hides to escape as does Namond, who is within sight of Michael's misfortune. Later, having changed his clothes Namond buys ice creams for his friends even including Dukie at Michael's urging.

Freamon reveals that he is disappointed with Stanfield's organization - they have poor phone discipline and don't seem to be murdering anyone. Freamon also asks Pearlman to sign off on subpoenas of key political figures that they have linked to the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Barksdale</a> organization through their investigation of the money trail. Pearlman questions their new lieutenant's willingness to pursue the case and Freamon tells her he is fearless. Pearlman criticizes Freamon's timing with the forthcoming election and he feigns a lack of knowledge. Greggs meets with Lieutenant Asher, the unit's new commander, and has him sign all the papers they need by distracting him with talk about his beach house construction project.</p>

<p>District DEU sergeant <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_Carver_c411.html" title="Ellis Carver">Ellis Carver</a> harasses Bodie and his crew. He knows all of their names and their roles. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a> arrives to see if Carver needs assistance. He reminds Carver of Bodie beating charges on the wiretap by claiming entrapment and then leaves telling Bodie to close his operation down for the day.

Carver reminds Colicchio that if they come down hard on everyone, they'll have no one to get information from when something serious happens.</p>
<p>Officer McNulty is called to meet with new district commander <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Major Daniels</a> and his administrative lieutenant <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Dennis_Mello" title="List of characters from The Wire">Dennis Mello</a>. Daniels tries to convince McNulty to move out of the patrol division. Daniels admits to Mello that while he feels McNulty has capabilities beyond his post he is probably better off in patrol on a personal level.</p>
<p>At the roll call meeting the officers are given a mandatory lecture about soft targets for terrorism. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_District_of_The_Wire_f878.html#Michael_Santangelo" title="Western District of The Wire">Santangelo</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_District_of_The_Wire_f878.html#Lloyd_.22Truck.22_Garrick" title="Western District of The Wire">Truck</a> voice dissent about the usefulness of the seminar as due to the drug war and crime rate, counter-terrorism is not a priority feeling amongst the western district officers. Santangelo in particular comments "if them terrorists do fuck up the Western, could anybody even tell?" causing the other officers to laugh. Carver then jokes that if the terrorists came into West Baltimore to blow up something like a "chicken joint" that they would most likely be robbed of the "camels and robes" by a local stickup crew. As Lieutenant Mello calms the officers down, Bunk visits McNulty at the meeting to ask if he knows Lex. McNulty suggests Bunk talk to Carver as he is now on top of his work. Bunk suggests a drinking session and McNulty counters by inviting him to dinner with his partner <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Beadie_Russell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Beadie Russell</a>.

<p>The principal and assistant principal discuss their staffing problems. Prez arrives at the school as trainee teacher pending his certification. Principal Withers in particular is skeptical of his abilities until he tells them that his former occupation was a police officer on the force in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_City_07fc.html" title="Baltimore City">Baltimore City</a>. Hearing that he used to be a city cop, they hire him immediately feeling that he is up to the job to work at the school. Prez attends a seminar on teaching using praise to and self belief to motivate their students, it seems as misguided as the police seminar on terrorism and is met with a similar response. Teachers specifically ask the old woman who is giving the lecture what her lesson plan suggests when students vandalize the classroom and attempt to assault them with textbooks and pencil sharpeners. Prez later takes in his new classroom which is a complete mess but seems excited at the prospect of teaching.</p>

<p>Following Fruit's murder Marlo meets with his lieutenants including the bloodthirsty Monk and Tote and more reserved Partlow. Monk suggests they kill all of Lex's crew but Marlo sees that Lex was acting alone and decrees that he alone must die.</p>
<p>Lil Kevin pays Randy to deliver a message to Lex - apparently Patrice wants to meet him later that night. When Lex arrives for the meeting he finds Snoop and Partlow lying in wait. Bunk and Carver try to find Lex on his usual corner but they decide to return the next day when he is not present. Later, Randy sells food to Bodie's crew as they play dice. Lil Kevin gives Randy more money for following his instructions and tells him that Lex is dead. Meanwhile, Snoop and Partlow board the body into another vacant building. Randy sits on his stoop contemplating his involvement until he is called inside by his foster mother.<sup id="_ref-EG38_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EG38" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-E38_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E38" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
