<dd>I'm looking for the official BSA policy that says something to the effect that the BSA forbids its adult members from using their leader status to express political views to the public. The Scouting for All site is down temporarily but I don't think there is anything there that makes that general of a statement; it says Dave Rice was removed for "involving Scouting youth" in his effort to have a BSA policy changed. I think that there needs to be clarification here. What does the Scoutmaster's Handbook say exactly, etc.? --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 02:22, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As no one has found any since you first asked it it 4 months ago, the answer seems to be "No". No one has been to my knowledge, but then the discussions I heard about the issue followed BSA procedure through the districts and councils (not creating you own organization and encouraging Scouts to then promote it), thus there would be no reason to not renew a Leader's commission for the next year.

<p>Someone keeps changing the second paragraph of the introduction. Right now it states:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>My thought on the last sentence-- the "BSA advocates counter" is that introductions in particular are prone to having a runaway "back and forth" debate. Having "Side 1 says _____, and Side 2 says _______." is fine. But then you can get into "Side 1 counters.... and Side 2 counter-counters....", on and on. There's no logical way to end it-- one side can always have a logical reply back to something said by the other side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead, I try to have the intro and the "pro-/con-" sections of page just go: "Side 1 believes its good because..." and then "Side 2 believes its bad because". I usually don't care who goes first, but I often bump into people who feel strong that having the "first impression" or the "last word" conveys some advantage, so I usually okay with whichever. If left to my own resources, I usually just pick whichever side seems to have held the position first to be the one that goes first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So far, not having heard any good reason for its addition, I'd suggest removing the "BSA advocates counter" sentence. The sentiment is already covered when we say <i>"The Boy Scouts of America and its supporters contend that these policies are essential in its mission to "instill in young people lifetime values and develop in them ethical character""</i> The intro gets it on the record that one side feels these policies are "Good" and very concise description of why. The intro then gets on record that the other side feels these policies are "Bad" and a very concise descrition of why. Boom. That's all the intro needs to be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, the BSA and its supporters do feel the policies are lawful and therefore, not illegal discrimination. And critics would counter that legality does not imply morality. And supporters could reply that the policies are moral, and the law is just recognizing that. And critics could counter that the legality of the policies is a commentary more on libertarianism in the US constitution than the moral content of the policies. ANd .... so forth. Saying "BSA advocates counter that it is not discrimination, but is adherence to their membership standards" doesn't really add any new information that isn't in the FIRST BSA sentence (which says the policies are "Good") or in the next paragraph )which definitively says the policies are legal).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I like the version we had up circa a week ago:
<dl>
<dd>The Boy Scouts of America and its supporters contend that these policies are essential in its mission to "instill in young people lifetime values and develop in them ethical character". Critics believe that some or all of these policies are wrong and amount to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">immoral</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It has that symmetry I talked about. Side 1: Good! Side 2: Bad! The end.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking through the history, I see the first objection to the was that the discrimination should be described as "legal" rather than "immoral". But I strongly disagree on that point, because the legality of the policies is not a point of dispute anymore, only the morality of the policies. The "crux" of the criticism is that the policies are somehow "bad", not that the policies are illegal. (Obviously, we need to mention that the policies ARE legal, which we do, in no uncertain terms, in the very next sentence).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, the next stab it was simply to say "critics contend the policies amount to discrimination"-- but this is again inaccrute, because whether or not the policies are (in the literal since of the word) "discrimination" is not being debated either. (To the extent that supporters of the policies dispute that word, it is because "discrimination", as commonly used, has become synonymous with '"'immoral <i>discrimination"). In general, it seems unwise for us to remove "immoral" from the summary of the critics' POV or to insert "legal" in its place. While most critics DO admit the policies are legal (as show in the following sentence), this is hardly the point-- the critics don't object to the policies because they believe the policies are legal-- they object to the policies because they believe they are immorally discriminatory.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My vote, therefore, is to move back to the version as of a week ago (an edit I'll make in just a sec). This version:
<ul>
<li>Gives each side one and only one sentence in the intro, so that we know they both exist.</li>
<li>Lets each side very concisely "make their case", stating the tiniest kernel of their position.</li>
<li>Immediately thereafter states the legality of the policies as an unequivocal fact, in no uncertain terms.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As such, there is no need to delete the critics' POV that the policies are immoral discrimination. Similarly, there's no reason to add in a additioanl sentence stating that the supporters think the critics are wrong-- this is implicit. Nor is there any reason to add a separate supporters' opinion that the policies are legal-- this is unequivocally stated as a fact in the following paragraph.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Oh, you're quite right, it is-- it's the critic's POV. We, the "Wikipedia voice" cannot say the policies are immoral. The sentence "The BSA's policies are immoral." must NEVER appear in the article outside of a quote. But we can say that the critics regard the policy as immoral, which they do.</dd>
<dd>The flip-side of this is that it's loaded with POV to say that excluding gays/atheists will "instill in young people lifetime values and develop in them ethical character". Two people could have a never ending debate over whether the policies instill or degrade ethical character in young people. But this sentence,too, is okay, so long as we attribute that view to the BSA.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Talk%7EBoy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies_ade7.html" title="Edit section: Return to last week's intro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to last week's intro</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I've again returned the intro to last week's intro. As of this moment, there isn't a consensus to change it, so we talk about it until there is one.</p>
<p>Evrik-- I'm sure that some people do have a problem that critics of the BSA consider the policies to be immoral. I'm sure that many opponents of the policies similarly have a problem with the fact that the supporters of the BSA consider homosexuality to be immoral, or that the BSA feels that excluding gays&amp;atheists helps children become more ethical. I'm know for a fact that BOTH sides have deep problems with the POVs of the other side.</p>
<p>However, your disagreeing with the critics' POV does not cause them to cease to exist, or cause their point of view to no longer be revelent. The fact is, critics DO feel the policies are immoral discrimination. That's just how they feel. May be right, may be wrong, but that's they way they feel about the subject. That's why there's an article about this in the first place-- if you DIDN'T have a problem with them calling hte policies immoral, and if they didn't have a problem with the BSA calling homosexuality/atheism, then we wouldn't have an article here in the first place.</p>
<p>If you want the critic's point of view removed, it is not sufficient for you to argue that their point of view is wrong, or that you take issue with it. We don't debate the issues, we don't decide the issues, we just cover 'em, ya know? If you want the statement taken out, you need to prove that the critics do NOT believe that the policies are immoral discrimination. Saying that YOU don't believe they are immoral discrimination does not help your case in any way, because we're not saying that you believe that, we're saying the critics believe that. To remove it, you have to say that the critics some DON'T believe it's immoral discrimination.</p>
<p>I think this is a very difficult case to make, because there are a number of primary sources in which the critics refer to the policies as a) "discriminatory" b)"immoral" and c) "immoral policies of discrimination". See, for example <a href="http://www.uua.org/news/scouts/scouts_actions.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uua.org/news/scouts/scouts_actions.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> which bears a title <b>Scouting For All's National Day of Protest Against the Boy Scouts of America's Immoral Policy of Discrimination Against Gay Youth and Adults</b>. Or take the critical site <a href="http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/" rel="nofollow">BSA-discrimination.org</a>, the url and site name both mentioning "Discrimination in the BSA".</p>
<p>In addition to the deletion of the critic's views on immorality, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies&amp;oldid=88238706" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies&amp;oldid=88238706" rel="nofollow">reorg edit</a> had some other issues. The additional counter argument "BSA advocates counter that it is not discrimination, but is adherence to their membership standards" was re-added, despite my above expressed concerns. (As an interesting bonus, also note how the sentence rebuts a "phantom" criticism that was itself deleted from the article in that reorganization").</p>
<p>Lastly, and this, like all of the things i've said, is something we can discuss. I personally prefer 3 paragraphs to 2. Paragraph 1: Here's the situation. 2: Here's each side's POV. 3: Legal issues. Merging 2 into 1 is, to me, conflating two very distinct ideas. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 18:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have a problem with the word immoral. I'm just fine with no word before discrimination or using the word "legal" which is also used by anti-BSA people.

<dd>Legal discrimination doesn't explain why people have filed lawsuits. If they filed lawsuits, they must have thought it was illegal.

<dd>See, that's just the point exactly. the legality and the morality are two completely separate issues. Something doesn't have to be illegal for it to be immoral. The critics's point of view is that it is immoral, period. It's a fact that they feel that. If you want that fact removed, you have to start convincing all the critics in the country that the BSA's policies aren't immoral, and when all their sites and the reliable news sources report that the critics have changed their minds, THEN you can remove it. What I think, or what you think, or what Wikipedia thinks-- those are irrelevant. There are critics, they do have a POV, and we have to convey that POV.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, thank you for not editing it back and forth. Putting up the POV tag is a much better alternative. Now I will go ahead and post this on RFC and see what people think about which version is better and whether the current wording violates NPOV.</dd>

<li>Yes, but there are critics who also call it 'legal discrimination.' I'm okay with the word <i>discrimination</i>, but the (im)moralizing in inserting the word <i>immoral</i> is where I draw the line. If some people use the word immoral, so what - they're trying to make a point - and it's not neutral.

<dd>The difference, however, is that the titles are _our_ words-- Wikipedia's words. In the title, we declare things to be fact or fiction-- titles must RIGIDLY adhere to a neutral wording. In the article however, sometimes we are speaking as "Wikipedia". But when we summarize the views of others, we should present their views directly-- being careful to be balanced. Note, for example that the BSA's views are presented in what would be a non-neutral fashion, were we not explicitly attributing those views to the BSA and it's supporters.</dd>
<dd>Your proposal for a compromise is kind of you, and I appreciate the sentiment. I do think, however, it's better to go foward in cases like this, and see what others think, so that we can both better learn "what NPOV means". If we compromise, we sort of escape having to go through the learning process of figuring out which NPOV interpretation is right. But, no worries-- a Request For Comment isn't an adversarial, hateful thing-- nobody will get blocked, no harsh words need be shed.

<dd>For one, I seem to think somebody objected to that solution a while back and said it wasn't clear enough or something, but it might have been me that objected!&#160;:). In my opinion, immoral discriminiation best sums up the critical POV, because if we take the word in the literalest sense, everyone can agree that the BSA policies are, technically, a form of discrimination. The real crux of the controversy-- the thing that really separates the pros- from the cons-, is whether that discrimination is an immoral kind of discrimination (like banning all blacks would be) or very moral kind of discrimination (like banning all convincted sex offenders). --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 22:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The initial version is best. It is a well-cited fact that the critics do indeed regard the policies as immoral discrimination. On the other hand, it may or may not be true that all the critics regard the discrimination as legal-- i.e. complying with all federal, state, and local laws. This sentence should summarize the position of the critics, and their position is that they opppose the policies because they believe them to be <b>immoral</b>. It is not their position that they oppose the policies because they believe them to be <b>legal</b>. I believe the current version best conveys the nature of the controversy, and I do not feel it poses any NPOV problems. Similaly, the BSA's official statement, found in the initial version, does the best job of conveying the BSA's point of view. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 22:22, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are some people who believe it is illegal, some people who believe it is wrong, some people who believe it is immoral, and some people who believe it is a combination of the above. The only thing that all these critics agree on is that it is discrimination. In any case, the above three qualities are all quite clearly judgmental, and any one of those adjectives ought to be sourced.

<p>Seems like there's a fair amount of consensus behind what is currently label "version 2". (and please, no one change the labeling around&#160;:) ). That's the version that says has neither "immoral", "illegal" or "legal", but just says "... Critics believe that some or all of these policies are wrong and are <i><b>discriminatory</b></i>."</p>
<p>I think the initial version is better, but I can certainly live with that one, no question asked. I think Jagz can live with it. (correct me if you object to it though Jagz). Evrik is the one who proposed it in the first place, so I think that he could live with it. Ramsquire thinks it's the optimal verison, and JBKramer has listed it as one of his two favorites.</p>
<p>Having seen so many independent eyeballs endorse dropping the word "immoral", I'm satisfied, therefore, that Version 2 is the consensus version, and I'd be cool with using that version and calling it good. If however, anyone wants to wait for more opinions, that's totally fine. For my part, however, I'm now satisfied that Version 2, the "compromise" solution Evrik, is not just a "compromise" but an actual consesus". --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 21:16, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Version #2 and #3 use the word discrimination. I think we should avoid the word discrimination since that may imply something illegal.

<dl>
<dd>Well, I think most people understand that discrimination is different than lawfulness-- indeed the examples of racial discrimination that most easily jump into our mind are those in which laws mandated discrimination-- the anti-jewish laws of the early Nazi period, the Jim Crow laws of the American South, and Apartheid of South Africa. Discriminatory is the word I hear critics most often use, I think.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The policies are unfair, politically incorrect, and bigoted."? That critics would call the policies unfair is true, but I don't think the critics typically would use the other two terms, although i don't know many critics, so perhaps they would. "Politically incorrect" is usually used as a term to demean action that are really harmless but which are often objected to on insubstantial grounds-- i.e. it would the supporters of the BSA that would say "The policies aren't wrong, they're just another example of 'political correctness' gone overboard".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bigoted is in the neighborhood of what some critics would say, but I think it's a step beyond what the "bulk" of the critics would say. Certainly, you get people comparied the BSA to the KKK, because that's how shocking arguments are made, I get the feeling that the majority of the critics are criticizing the policies more than than people, and wouldn't apply the term "bigoted" to BSA, which most seem to feel is a "basically good (or formerly good) organization which made some bad choices". I think some reference to discrimination is the best summary of what I hear critics say-- they liken the treatment of gays and atheists to the race-based discriminations done against blacks and jews. Even if that's not legally true, that's still the "vibe" they send out.</dd>

<dd>I believe you'll find the word bigot or bigoted used on the Scouting for All website. If you just use the words wrong and discriminatory, people may not know what you're talking about exactly. Maybe by adding a few more words or different words you can be more specific. Right now though, people are going to think we're talking about atheists, agnostics, homosexuals, and girls because of the way the previous paragraph is now worded. I don't think that you're intending to refer to the girls issue. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 02:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I mean is that the BSA doesn't contend that excluding girls is essential in its mission to "instill in young people...". They exlcude girls for other reasons. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 07:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think if you asked the BSA, they would say that being boys-only does further their mission. I did like adding the additional term "immoral" to discriminatory to underscore that may people think the policies are a type of particularly bad discrimination, as opposed discriminations that are less controversial (the BSA's age and gender requirements, for example).</dd>
<dd>But I don't think "bigoted" is the word. I'm certain that "politically incorrect" isn't. Bigoted, to me, crosses a line and talks more about people than policy. Certainly, many critics DO make that leap, but many other critics adamently avoid it. I also wouldn't mind saying "amount to <b>unfair</b> discrimination" or some other such stuff, or some other modifier on the policy-- for some odd reason, I feel like "amounts to bigotry" would be better than "bigoted", but I can't really explain why. Isn't that weird. Crazy brain.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I definitely get the feeling that our current critics sentence doesn't quite "nail" the criticism-- but on the other hand, all the intro really has to say is "BSA says its good. Critics say its bad". So long as a sentence quickly and concisely does that without creating any problems its own, it basically does the job. I do think that just saying "wrong and amounts to discriminatory" probably isnt' the "perfect" sentence though. -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 16:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mind if you use discrimination or discriminatory. It seems like the BSA's values are really the source of the discrimination though, not the policies. The policies reflect the values and are apparently necessary as otherwise it would confuse or interfere with BSA's "expressive message". See <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_v._Dale_e534.html" title="Boy Scouts of America v. Dale">Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</a>.

<dd>Well, that's a whole other debate that isn't as notable enough for us to cover, but it's going on below the surface. Some supporters insist the BSA values compel the policies, and I'm sure there must be some supporters who think the old values didn't but BSA should adopt more stringent values. There are critics, meanwhile, who insist BSA values actually prohibit the policies-- in this view, the BSA is a basically non-discriminatory organization that has been 'hijacked' since the 1980s by more conservative elements. And then there are critics who believe the BSA's values do compel the policies, and the values are wrong. The most common viewpoint are the 1st and 3rd, but I've bumped in to the other two along the way. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 19:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about just discriminatory? The wrong/immoral disctinction would be covered by that word.

<dl>
<dd>Well, ya'll are the boss, so to speak. Clearly some people an issue with saying that the critics think it's immoral. I myself don't see how that's any different, substantively, from saying they're "wrong". Look up the definition for "wrong" and meaning one is "immoral". So for that reason, it's just a minor syntactic issue, not really worth losing sleep over, but as long as we're talking about it, I might as well mention that I do for some stylistic reason like "immoral" more than "wrong".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How is "immoral" in any way a NPOV violation? The critics <b>do</b> think it's immoral, which is all we're saying. We have plenty of sentences that explain why the BSA feels its moral values compel the policies, after all.</dd>
<dd>In any case, you're right-- discriminatory is better. I actually thoguht it sounded better before but somehow got distracted and forgot it hadn't been used. And now that you mention the legal distiction, it's definitely better. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 19:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally, my beef with immoral is that it leads towards violating some religious belief or something (e.g. fornication, adultery, etc. ). I could be wrong about that. "Wrong" doesn't have that connotation. However, simply using discriminatory accurately describes the position of the critics, and doesn't get into whether "immoral" is POV. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 20:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well there is also impermissable and we could check a thesaurus. Note that there are two sorts of critics. One who would like the BSA to change and that the discrimination is against what scouting stands for and one who feel that the BSA can set what criteria it wants (much like a Jewish youth org might only allow Jews) but that special government support for groups that discriminate on either sexual orientation or religion should not be allowed (some critics hold both views).

<p>"The Boy Scouts give female adult leaders all of the privileges of male adult leaders. Although this was not true in decades past, the policy was instituted in response to a shortage of adult males willing to participate actively in running the troops. While many scouting adults do have their own children in the program, it is not necessary to have a child in the program to be actively involved with a scout unit.</p>
<p>Until 1954, the Boy Scouts of America was a racially segregated organization. Colored Troops, as they were officially known, were given little support from Districts, Councils and the national offices. Some scouting executives and leaders believed that Colored Scouts and Leaders would be less able to live up to the ideals of the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, some Boy Scout troops in the Eastern United States were involved in a scandal resulting in violence occurring on campout trips. In Virginia, a report surfaced that a scout had been badly beaten by fellow scouts at the Goshen, Virginia Boy Scout Camp. Further reports followed of bullying of younger scouts by older scouts, especially on prolonged outdoor trips where adult supervision was limited. Parents challenged the Boy Scouts attitude to such instances, since several adult leaders were quoted as saying that scouts in the field should "know how to take care of themselves" and that "natural horseplay" on campout trips was not a problem.</p>
<p>To prevent such incidents and other forms of child abuse, the BSA developed an extensive Youth Protection Plan in the mid-eighties that actively teaches both youth members and adult leaders in how to recognise, resist and report child abuse in both Scout and non-Scout venues. In addition, it provides tight requirements on adult leadership and activities to help ensure that Scouting is a safe venue for its participants. Several Scouts have been expelled from the organization for violence." --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 23:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think to be exact many (but not all) local groups turned a blind eye to atheists and agnostics in the ranks; this is probably still true (and gays have probably been added to the list that blind eyes are turned to).

<p>The Camp Fire USA Law, which dates from the first few years of Camp Fire, was originally the Wood Gatherer’s Desire. In 1942 the words “Worship God,” implicit in the whole statement, were explicitly given as the first item of the law. The word “law” is sometimes misleading, however. At no time in the organization’s history has a Camp Fire member been asked to take any oath or make any promise. The Camp Fire law is a desire or a goal, not an oath. We believe that children and youth are our most precious resources.</p>

<dd>I think the <i>Monopoly</i> section is a circular argument - "BSA is a monopoly because it is a monopoly". While it may appear to be a monopoly to you, it is not the only Scouting organization for boys - it's just the most successful. Using the term <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> means there are no other similar programs and implies that the BSA is making efforts to make sure no other similar program can succeed. It implies at least a nefarious intent, which would seem to be a POV statement. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 16:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Hence BSA doesn't have a monopoly on youth outdoor programs. And as we said, monopoly is an economic term, not applicable in this contest.

<dd>A good point. I single organisation with name ownership not only prevents the use of the known and attractive term "Scouting" for its activities but in the case of BSA prevents other organisations from taking part in the very attractive international activities of Scouting such as Jamborees.

<p>The BSA charter is a bit more than honorary, as it adds an extra measure of protection to trademarks and copyrights. BTW- as I understand it, Boyce tried to get a charter in 1910 or so, but it got tied up with Hearst over some issue. West finally got the charter through in 1916 as part of his attempts to keep the BSA trademark from being diluted. Frankly, this is no different than any other corporation protecting its marks. The BSA has never gone after other youth organizations <i>per se</i> (and indeed helped to start the Camp Fire Girls), only after groups misusing a trademark. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 13:48, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From my reading, the BSA did pursue the ABS (and others), but only because of their use of <i>Boy Scout</i>. Intellectual property laws were much different a century ago, so the current procedures probably did not exist. I do not know how trademarks were handled at the turn of the last century, but I do know a bit about sound recording copyrights. Sound recordings such as records did not have a Federal copyright until 1972, but every state had a different copyright law. Thus, protecting the copyright on a record would have been a frustrating exercise. Since the BSA had a federal charter, they had clear rights across the US.</dd>

<dd>I checked the specifics as written in the 1937 BSA History ("Murray"). One of the precessor organizationss was incorporated in New York and the BSA itself was in DC in 1910. Then in late February 1917, (after the Charter was signed by the President) they met in Washington, dissolved the previous organization, and reincorporated under the Federal Charter. I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that allows their incorporation to take precedence over any competing body incorporated at a state level, so they don't have to fight in every state. GSUSA, the Red Cross and I think some things like ComSat are similarly organized, but you need to get a Federal Charter first to do so. Also BSA is required to annually present it's annual report to Congress, something state incorporated bodies are not required to do GCW50 14:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dt>Federal charters are intended as honorary titles that serve as a prestigious national recognition of an organization.[4]</dt>
<dd>The BSA charter is more than honorary. As noted in the next section, it gives it exclusive rights to emblems and the like. This was probably important at the time as copyright laws were quite different and quite spotty (see my previous remarks above). It is important now, as the charter means that there is no expiration on any trademark or patent. A federal charter is certainly more than honorary to the Red Cross per my comments above.
<dl>
<dd>The wikipedia entry on charters defines them as "A charter is a legally binding document incorporating an organization or institution and specifying its purpose, remit or bylaws." So the federal charter makes BSA a federal corporation. GCW50 14:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>More recently, in 2003, the BSA filed litigation with the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board against the Youthscouts</dt>
<dd>This rather implies that the BSA is targeting the Youthscouts. This isn't correct- from the <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20%20}" class="external text" title="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20%20}" rel="nofollow">USPTO site</a>, it appears that the BSA is actively protecting the uses of terms such as <i>Scout</i>, <i>Scouting</i>, <i>Tiger Cub</i>, <i>Pinewood Derby</i>, <i>Scouting/USA</i>, <i>Jamboree</i>, <i>BSA</i>, <i>Explorer</i> and <i>Codemaster</i>.</dd>
<dt>A result of the BSA's protection activities has been the suppression of rival organizations.</dt>
<dd>This is going to need a definite cite. If an organization that has to give up the Scout name went out of business, then that really reflects on weaknesses in the organization. If you are specifically referring to the ABS, then I should point out that from the little I can find, the ABS was never that strong, and Hearst withdrew support early on. The BSA never legally pursued the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lone_Scouts_of_America_3b7d.html" title="Lone Scouts of America">Lone Scouts of America</a> or the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA_835b.html" title="Girl Scouts of the USA">Girl Scouts of the USA</a>. West did have issues with the Girl Scouts of America name and he was upset with the LSA, but he never took legal action.</dd>
<dt>Alternate Scouting organizations could have different membership policies. Additional significant Scouting organizations in the United States could make Scouting available to Americans who are not allowed to be members of the BSA's programs.</dt>
<dd>These statements are speculative and smack of original research. Indeed, alternative programs such as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Heritage_Girls_ed8d.html" title="American Heritage Girls">American Heritage Girls</a> that split from the GSUSA have <b>more</b> exlusive membership requirements.

<dd>And WOSM probably wouldn't endorse a new Scouting organization in the US, even if BSA ever said it would have no objections. WOSM was founded in 1920 with strong input from the UK SA and BSA with the idea of only having one non-denominational Scouting organization per country, as separate organizations go against the concept of being a "brother to every other Scout". But since it was already 13 years since the Scouting movement began, there were some countries that already had multiple organizations, mostly segregated by religion in Europe and European colonies. Those countries had to agree to a national federation to be admitted to WOSM. But the WOSM endorsed trend is CONSOLIDATION of spreviously segregated organizations within countries, not creation of new federations. This is shown in Ireland and South Africa and to some extent in Canada, where the only difference now is the primary language actually spoken in the troop. The concept of WOSM ever endorsing the creation of a second splinter Scouting organization in a member country strains belief. GCW50 14:20, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The meat of this section is that the BSA is acting as a monopoly and keeping any other groups from using the Scouting program. As I noted above, the BSA '<i>must</i> actively defend its trademarks or copyrights or those marks will become generic. This is no different from any other corporation such as <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=xerox&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" class="external text" title="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=xerox&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" rel="nofollow">Xerox</a>, <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=disney&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" class="external text" title="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=disney&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" rel="nofollow">Disney</a> or even <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Rotary%20International%20%20" class="external text" title="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Rotary%20International%20%20" rel="nofollow">Rotary International</a>.

<p>This seems to me to be a very insider point of view. Let me give an outsider view. First, the Spiral Scouts appear to be less exclusive. Second, I see it as fairly obvious that one thing an alternative Scouting organisation could do is allow brothers and sisters to be together in Cubs or Scouts, allowing the parents (and the community) to support one group not two. That is seen as a real plus here in Australia particularly in small rural communities. Third, if the BSA stopped its trademark and copyright protection, it would be like all (I suspect) other countries where the terms <i>Scout</i>, <i>Scouting</i>, <i>Cub</i>, <i>Pinewood Derby</i>, <i>Jamboree</i>, and <i>Explorer</i> are freely available. Is the BSA so vulnerable that it needs this protection. They would become "generic". So what? There is no "must" about it. The BSA does not have to have this protection. If having this protection "has absolutely nothing to do with the claim that the BSA is stifling competition", it sure helps, as any real alternative would be attacked and the new organisation who not be able to advertise itself as what it was - a Scouting organization. Well, I should not be commenting on the BSA but on the article. Everything I have said supports the view that a more outside view on BSA controversies would improve this article by making it more NPOV. I agree with you about sources. In "controversy" articles more than anywhere, everything must be sourced. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:22, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Its one word- <a href="../../../s/p/i/SpiralScouts_International_0e93.html" title="SpiralScouts International">SpiralScouts</a>). What this section boils down to is that because the BSA is protecting its trademarks, it is not allowing any competing organizations to form. As this is unsourced, it is starting to look like original research here. This is rather like trying to claim that since the American Red Cross <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=red+cross&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" class="external text" title="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=&amp;qs=red+cross&amp;propno=&amp;propnameop=&amp;propname=&amp;pop=&amp;pn=&amp;pop2=&amp;pn2=&amp;cop=&amp;cn=" rel="nofollow">protects its marks</a>, no similar organizations can be created in competition. As with any corporation, the BSA marks are both an identity and a source of income. For example, allowing Eagle Scout to be freely used would undermine the cachet of the program and diffuse its identity. Again, this section says to me that because an organization cannot use the term <i>Scout</i>, it cannot be successful. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 22:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SpiralScouts™ have been around since 1999. They trademarked their name but the BSA has not filed a complaint.

It is the trademarks of 'Scouts' 'Scouting' which the BSA is protecting (except to a degree from the GSUSA which can also use Scouts/Scouting though I think they usually prefix it with 'Girl'). Copyright only applies to longer works; most of Baden Powell's works and the original BSA manuals are long out of copyright (not that the BSA ever had copyright to the former) and I can't think of any groups trying to use more recent still in copyright works by the BSA. Copyright also is not lost if not defended. What the BSA has is a monopoly on the word 'Scout' and 'Scouting' in the US and a monopoly on access to the international Scouting movement of WOSM. It does not have a monopoly on starting up a youth group using scouting ideas (though the difficulty in starting such a group in this day is another matter). I'm not sure what the BSA would do if the GSUSA voted to admit boys (they did float the idea in 1975 but voted it down). --<a href="../../../e/r/p/User%7EErp_91c0.html" title="User:Erp">Erp</a> 02:06, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And they don't use the same terms. BSA uses the terms "Scouts" and "Scouting"; GSUSA almost always uses the terms "Girl Scouts" and "Girl Scouting" in it's literature in order to reinforce it's own identity. I think most of us know the difference betwen a boy and a girl; I'm not sure the public would be as clear with the terms "Spiral", "Peace" or "Rainbow". As a practical matter, GSUSA should have been using "Guiding". Baden Powell was very disappointed in Juliette Low's insistance in naming her organization "Girl Scouts". Read the biography of B-P by Jim Teal. Actually, I'm told that in the 1980's BSA approached GSUSA about the prospect of merging, but GSUSA rebuffed the idea as they believed that a single sex organization better met the needs of girls.

<dd>And WOSM is the major player. As a practical matter, small splinter groups such as Baden-Powell Scouts are TINY in comparison and rarely have troops in more than a few locales in a given country. Thus local alternative organizations are NOT available to most boys in countries that also have non-WOSM organizations. And once again, the bulk of the multiple organization WOSM federations are due to pre-existing troops SEGREGATED by religion or ethnicity. You keep trying to infer in the article that inclusive multiple organizations are widely available to most boys around the world. They are not, unless the kid's parents are willing to drive them hundreds of miles each week to a meeting. GCW50 12:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is impossible to write this article so that it pleases everyone 100%. I think that a lot of effort has been put into making the article neutral overall. The article content is controversial as the article name states. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 17:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The tone is still biased. I suspect that flows from the original attack piece within the BSA article that this article first originated as. While much better, it seems to want to avoid facts that place the controversy in context with what BSA really does for kids. The current tone of the article implies that this is a big thing in BSA and that BSA is constantly hunting under rocks to expel Scouts and Leaders.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You, as an Eagle Scout, should know better than anyone that nothing could be further from the truth. Almost anyone actively involved in Scouting at any level knows that the subject rarely comes up. A person really has to make a big deal about calling attention to themselves by publicly refusing to repeat the Scout Oath and Law or engaging in flagrantly public acts or declarations about their sexual identity. People are not routinely asked the specifics about their sexuality or religion and BSA does define a Theology and is thus not a religion itself. It's about as non-sectarian as an organization promoting a moral code can get.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Heck, BSA is constantly trying to keep Scouts and Leaders, not get rid of them. Witchhunts are rare, and even the few cases mentioned need to be considered against the fact that over 100 million people have been BSA members. Far more Scouters have been removed for other transgressions; most leave quietly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise, most of the supposed opposition groups (except for the ACLU, which seems to have morphed into gay rights advocacy organization irritated about the loss in the Dale case) no longer seem to exist or are mere shadows of themselves, if they ever consisted of more than a handful of people to begin with. This article is about the only current place on the web even implying that they are still active. That is a disservice to the truthfulness of Wikipedia . GCW50 14:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Do you want me to request mediation from Wikipedia then? You seem like a person who is bigoted in their views. There is no reason for us to try to discuss this further as far as I can see.

<dd>To chime in-- I have to strongly disagree with the idea that this article (its older version) doesn't comply with NPOV. Now, it could be that supporters of the BSA believe that a neutral POV is inherently biased, which might be, but i would be really skeptical of the claim that the article doesn't jibe with NPOV-- lots and lots of eyes have been over the article and found it okay.</dd>

<dd>I think the heart of the misunderstanding is expressed by the sentence: "Almost anyone actively involved in Scouting at any level knows that the subject rarely comes up". The implication being-- it's not that big of a controversy within the BSA, so it shouldn't be regarded as that big of a deal here. It's a debate between the BSAPOV and NPOV. The controversy is a larger issue in society, with lots and lots of supporters and critics chiming in on the issue, whether it's a big debate within BSA itself isn't the controlling issue.</dd>

<dd>Why??? Please point out which of the last revisions that I made are not true. Was anyone removed from the councils that proposed the changes in 2001? If so, who? Where is a religious award ever required of Scouts?? Are there not non-religious organizations on the BSA boards? Weren't all of the measures of Congressional support mentioned after the Dale decision?? etc., etc. Truth is what an encyclopedia is about, not advocacy, isn't it? GCW50 20:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually we don't what repercussions if any happened so I think saying no proponents were dismissed is going beyond what can be supported. The link for the info on the 2002 meeting certainly seemed to advocate the proponents of changing membership either shutting up or getting out; however, it was the organization's own opinion and not that of the BSA. I should note that other articles indicate other things at the 2002 meeting such as no proposal to change membership was voted on but a proposal was passed reaffirming the current policy.<a href="http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/archives.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/archives.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> --<a href="../../../e/r/p/User%7EErp_91c0.html" title="User:Erp">Erp</a> 21:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Slight correction. The proposals for membership change were apparently at the 2001 annual meeting not 2002.

<dd>GCW-- the statement about "No leaders were removed as this effort followed the procedures delineated in the BSA by-laws" is quintessential soapboaxing and original research. We don't know that's the case-- the source doesn't say that's the case. It presents as fact something which is directly contradicted by other sources (i.e. the several BSA memebers who claim they followed the rules but were forced out anyway).</dd>

<dd>When you insert "after the dale case" into the sentence "after the dale case, congress supported the BSA", you're basically putting in your own OR about what events are relevant. Sometimes it might be okay, but "being true" isn't a guarantee that it's okay. For example, suppose I went to the article on US President Bush and inserted the statement "After Germany executed six million jews in the Holocaust, President Bush met with the leader of Germany to thank them for their support against Terror. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/05/20020523-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/05/20020523-2.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>" Obviously, it "is true"-- you can look at the date and verify it, but of course, it's atrocious and just plain wrong. The insertion of "after dale, congress approved of bsa" implies "because of dale, congress approved", something that I think is only true of portions of the legislative body. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 23:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let's be realistic here. All of the activity in Congress mentioned in the article (in both directions, including the failed attempt to repeal the charter) were the result of the Dale decision and/or the resulting lawsuits or advocacy efforts. How many pieces of legislation involving Boy Scouts did Congress vote on in the seven years BEFORE the Dale case? The answer is none. The connection to the Dale Case is blatantly obvious to any neutral observer. GCW50 12:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If it's hard to prove a negative, then we shouldn't be stating negatives as facts. If the resolution passed by congress didn't reference the dale decision, we shouldn't be state that it was in response to the Dale decision. Saying "I bet it's true" or "Any neutral observer can conclude its true" don't resolve the problem that it's still not verifiable.</dd>
<dd>My own guess is that you're partially right and partially wrong about congress. I'd say that some members were directly voicing support for the policies (and Dale), but many others felt the BSA was a "basically good" organization with just one problem. My guess would be that a resolution overtly endorsing the policies would have resulted in contentious debate, as in the case with the analogous policies of the pre-Clinton US military. But see-- my personal interpretations, or yours, don't make it into the article. The resolutions didn't explicitly connect themselves to Dale, so we shouldn't put such a connection into the article in a way that implies congress (as a whole) made a connection. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 15:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Go back into the Congressional Record and read the congressional testimony about any of the bills. The testimony in each mentions the resulting post-Dale advocacy and lawsuits as to why the bills were introduced and should be passed. The 2005 Support Our Scouts Act was specifically in response to the Winkler suit which was instigated after the Dale case. GCW50 15:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The resolutions were passed after the Dale decision but the way it is written is misleading because it implies that the resolutions were in direct response to the Dale decision. The resolutions were more in response to things that happened in response to the Dale decision as it turned out to be a watershed event. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 18:29, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, if individual representatives made statements overtly supporting the policies, that's fine to note. I think we have sentence that says some members of congress did overtly support the policies, and more references/footnotes/text could be used to proved a more exhaustive list. But congress as a whole didn't reference Dale, and the resolutions, not overtly mentioning the issue, don't tell us much about what portion of congress supports the policies. We face a similar situation about that dead bill that would have changed people collecting attorneys fees for suing for civil rights violations-- how much of it's inception and defeat was a support or disapproval of the BSA policies? I don't think there's any way to tell. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 10:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason for my putting up the neutrality template was not because of GCW50's March 27 edits but because he stated that the article is biased and he has persisted in making pro-BSA edits for a period of time in excess of a year. He continues now even after the article has achieved featured article status and the edits have become more numerous recently. The last time he did this the article started looking like it was written by the BSA and that's when Alecmconroy rewrote it. After Alecmconroy's rewrite there was much work done to make the article NPOV overall so it could become a featured article. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 21:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not normally like commenting on articles about Scouting in the US, but I have been following the various controversies for many years. If this article is biased in any way, it is biased towards the BSA not against. In general I think it does a good job of being NPOV. I would also comment that WP is not about truth but about what verifiable sources say.

<dd>So are you saying that the article is <b>not</b> biased and are you willing to put in edits on both side of the issue instead of just neutral or pro-BSA edits? --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 14:49, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just as long you do the same. For example, this morning you removed the paragraph on the "Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act (HR 2679)" reasoning that "there's no room in the article for dead bills". But somehow you "forgot" to remove the other dead bill mentioned in the article (The Scouting for All Act) which never even passed any vote. Thus I finshed the pruning of dead bills for you since you indicate that there's no room for them. I'm sure that missing the Scouting for All bill was just an inadvertant oversight on your part.

<dd>Let me get this straight. You're saying that your removal of a dead pro-BSA bill "for space considerations" by itself doesn't bias the article, and my subsequently removing a similarly dead anti-BSA bill in response does? GCW50 12:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That's correct, but I'm sure all of Alecmconroy anti-BSA edits easily counterbalance them. I believe it was he who started this whole thing in the main BSA article in the first place.</dd>
<dd>I've been dealing with this for over 15 years since I was sysop for the Scouting forum on Compuserve. We had a separate section there for BSA policy issues designed just for this kind of discussion. But every time some poor scout leader asked a question in the Scoutcraft section, Eliott Welsh would pop-in with something like "How can you teach those kids abouts knot-tying, when my poor kid can't be in Tiger Cubs?". (BTW, it was actually because Welsh himself had an issue, not his son) After doing some research about Welsh and his previous non-BSA self-promotional lawsuits, I began to realize that a lot of this posting is really folks just trying to use BSA as symbol of mainstream America to get endorsement for their beliefs. And that has been a needless distraction from all of the good Scouting does at the local level.</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong, I personally have some diferences with BSA's positions and BSA folks could have handled all of this a lot better, but I get irritated when I see folks put in factual errors or innuendo to continue the controversy. An example of one is the fact that this article doesn't explicitly state that BSA (or any other youth group) doesn't award religious emblems; they are actually awarded by the church itself, usually at at church ceremony, not a Scouting one. But the article dances around it by merely saying they "administer" the program. If you want a cite about who awards them, in it's the 1985 history of BSA by American Heritage.

<dd>For example, until I edited it, the section on Religious Emblems was written to imply that these are a big BSA program. They are not, they are totally optional programs run by the specific religions themselves as anyone who has ever read a Scoutmasters handbook would know. And anyone active in Scouting would tell you that only a tiny percentage (I'd say it's not more than ten percent) of Scouts ever pursue them. But it was originally written to imply a major Scouting program.

<dd>Likewise they're are lot more non-religious than religious organizations on BSA's boards, (see the BSA annual report) but that fact keeps getting edited out. Why? Because implying that BSA is run by religions is a better fit with some peoples agendas for this article. GCW50 14:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The paragraph and the preceding paragraphs are discussing religion. I don't think any reasonable person would deduce from the way the paragraph is written that the boards are only made of people from religious organizations. It's more about you. You know when you ask someone if it is hot or cold in a room or is it just me? Well I think it is just you.

<dd>I still think the article needs some points of reference as to the relative magnitude of issues. For example, how many local United Ways exist gives an idea of what fifty not supporting BSA really means, the fact that there have been over 100 million members of BSA and only about 2 dozen have taken legal action feeeling they were being excluded, the number of members in Scouting for All and the other activist groups, etc. Those are easily documented facts, but they keep getting edited out. Likewise, the fact that probably fewer than ten percent of Scouts earn their religion's religious emblem is obvious to anyone who has a looked at a bunch of Scouts in uniform. That last fact is hard to "cite" though as I don't believe BSA has such a stat since they don't award the emblems, nor track who earns them.</dd>

<dd>The lack of such point of reference stats makes the article more of a promotional piece for the opposition groups, who in many cases, are mostly a web site written by one guy. "Youth Scouts" is the prime example, but "Forgotten Scouts" fits into the same category. If I go out and create web sites for a dozen new pro-BSA organizations that I form, can we include all of them in the article without mentioning that I might be the only member? I hope you see the point as to why size does matter in helping folks judge significance. GCW50 13:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can put information on the total number of United Ways, Eagle Scouts, Scouts, etc. in their respective articles, and links in this article will allow people to get more detailed information if they want it. Statistics can be misleading. Say a mayor of a city with a high crime rate says last year xxxx people were victims of violent crime, however, xxxxxxxxxx people were not victims. Is that supposed to mean people can walk around by themselves at night anywhere because after all there were so many people who were not victimized. You can write a section on the magnitude of the problem if you can cite it properly. The point with the Forgotten Scouts and Scouting for All is that some people have formed advocacy groups. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 19:44, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gays and atheists are minorities in the United States and it's an emotional issue with some in the majority so it's no surprise when you start throwing out number greater than 50%. Maybe we should put a section in on how churches brainwash people and if it wasn't for all that brainwashing that the numbers would be different. Stop using statistics to validate the oppression of minorities. I don't think we should try to put the name of every advocacy group into the article but since we are mentioning that people have created advocacy groups it is good to list some examples. I don't see comments from others agreeing with you on this page. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagz_53d7.html" title="User:Jagz">Jagz</a> 22:15, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
