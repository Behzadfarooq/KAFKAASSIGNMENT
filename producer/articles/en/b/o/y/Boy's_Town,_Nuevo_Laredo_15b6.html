<p>The history of compounds restricted for prostitution goes back to Precuauhtemic (Prehispanic) times. Although it is not certain which indigenous nation began to institute controlled brothels, it is known to go back at least to the Mexica (Aztecs). The Cihuacalli was the name given to those controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities. "Cihuacalli" is a Nahuatl word which means "House of Women".</p>
<p>The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all of which were looking to a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of Tlazolteotl, the goddess of "filth". Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premices guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, and at the same time do spiritual cleansing of such acts.</p>
<p>There are stories that also refer to certain places, either inside the Cihuacalli or outside, where women would performe erotic dance in front of men. The great poet Tlaltecatzin of Cuauhchinanco registered that special women would perform erotic dances at certain homes or places. Apparently this was also controlled. Tlaltecatzin called them "Joyful Women", the equivalent of today's escort services.</p>
<p>The origins of the Boy's Town can be traced in part to the peculiar relationship that developed between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> and various <i>ad hoc</i> <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneurs</a> in northern Mexico during the Army’s 1916–17 <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Villa_Expedition_4e5d.html" title="Pancho Villa Expedition">Punitive Expedition</a>; specifically when General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_J._Pershing_797d.html" title="John J. Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>’s forces were pursuing General <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Villa_e0b8.html" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chihuahua.html" title="Chihuahua">Chihuahua</a>.</p>
<p>While the troops were based 100 kilometers south of <a href="../../../c/i/u/Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez_90cc.html" title="Ciudad Juárez">Ciudad Juárez</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chihuahua.html" title="Chihuahua">Chihuahua</a>, at Colonia Dublain, a small group of vendors, launderers, barkeeps, and prostitutes set up businesses next to the army camp. Eventually, General Pershing ordered that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitutes.html" title="Prostitutes">prostitutes</a> be restricted to the southern end of the camp where they would be inspected and certified by the military medical officers. A flat rate for sexual intercourse was also established.</p>
<p>Within a few decades, this concept was adopted by vice entrepreneurs and city managers elsewhere along the border. These compounds, called <i>zonas de tolerancia</i>, were eventually established in at least seven Mexican cities along the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.-Mexico_border_5188.html" title="U.S.-Mexico border">U.S.-Mexico border</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Luis_R%C3%ADo_Colorado_9ff3.html" title="San Luis Río Colorado">San Luis Río Colorado</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agua_Prieta_cc56.html" title="Agua Prieta">Agua Prieta</a>, <a href="../../../o/j/i/Ojinaga.html" title="Ojinaga">Ojinaga</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/u/Ciudad_Acu%C3%B1a_c552.html" title="Ciudad Acuña">Ciudad Acuña</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedras_Negras_9598.html" title="Piedras Negras">Piedras Negras</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nuevo_Laredo_0340.html" title="Nuevo Laredo">Nuevo Laredo</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reynosa.html" title="Reynosa">Reynosa</a>). Later, several other cities, not located on the border, established compound <i>zonas</i> as well, including <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabinas_Hidalgo_c185.html" title="Sabinas Hidalgo">Sabinas Hidalgo</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nuevo_Le%C3%B3n_e81d.html" title="Nuevo León">Nuevo León</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salina_Cruz_8e86.html" title="Salina Cruz">Salina Cruz</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/x/Oaxaca.html" title="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>. While the concept of a zoned area for prostitution activities is not unique to Mexico (as it exists in various forms in other countries), the form and internal structure of Mexico’s frontier <i>zonas</i> owe much to the arrangement authorized by General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_J._Pershing_797d.html" title="John J. Pershing">John J. Pershing</a> in 1916–17. The current <i>zona</i> in Nuevo Laredo was constructed in the 1960s because city authorities wanted to concentrate prostitution activities within a controlled zone. However, a number of brothels and bars catering to prostitution still operate in the downtown area with the tacit approval of the government. However a black market of prostitution is for the most part unregulated by the government. Immigrants from Central and South America are primarily involved as sex workers.</p>

<p>Boy's Town is a fascinating example of commercial spatial organization within the vice trades. The commercial activities can be differentiated into a number of broad categories, and their spatial organization is outlined in the map. The categories include: (1) primary or major <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothels.html" title="Brothels">brothels</a>, (2) secondary <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothels.html" title="Brothels">brothels</a>, (3) <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cribs.html" title="Cribs">cribs</a> of free-lance <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitutes.html" title="Prostitutes">prostitutes</a>, (4) <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantina.html" title="Cantina">cantinas</a> and bars catering to local patrons, (5) <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestite</a> bars, (6) other commercial services, and (7) residences. Furthermore, Boy's Town is protected by a substation of the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal_police.html" title="Municipal police">municipal police</a>, complete with jail, and there is a health clinic that performs blood tests and weekly screenings of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_workers.html" title="Sex workers">sex workers</a> for <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venereal_diseases.html" title="Venereal diseases">venereal diseases</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy%27s_Town%2C_Nuevo_Laredo_15b6.html" title="Edit section: Primary brothels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Primary brothels</span></h3>
<p>The primary brothels are relatively large establishments with full bar service, numerous on-site rooms for liaisons, and some have private parking, gardens, and cafeterias for sex workers. They are usually staffed with 20-60 prostitutes on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and about half that during weeknights. Only one has <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strippers.html" title="Strippers">strippers</a> (Club Danash). They also provide free lodging and one daily meal to prostitutes who work at least 5 days per week. The primary brothels attract visitors from out of town and they generate a sense of excitement with their large neon signs, unique architecture, and frequent special events, including formal dances, <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grito_de_Dolores_1176.html" title="Grito de Dolores">Mexican Independence Day</a> parties, Christmas parties, and costume events, etc. These higher quality brothels are mostly frequented by foreigners and younger, wealthier Mexicans (local or from elsewhere in Mexico).</p>
<p><a name="Secondary_brothels" id="Secondary_brothels"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy%27s_Town%2C_Nuevo_Laredo_15b6.html" title="Edit section: Secondary brothels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secondary brothels</span></h3>
<p>The secondary brothels are more numerous and they are generally raunchier than the primary brothels. Furthermore, they usually have some type of floorshow to attract customers, including <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striptease.html" title="Striptease">striptease</a>, the occasional <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_sex_show.html" title="Live sex show">live sex show</a>, and one offers the all-too-famous <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_show.html" title="Donkey show">donkey show</a>. They are usually staffed with 5 to 15 prostitutes on any given evening, many of whom also perform in the shows. These brothels usually have on-site rooms of poor quality, and their dominant clientele are working-class locals; especially on <i>quincenas</i> (biweekly pay days).</p>
<p><a name="Cribs" id="Cribs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy%27s_Town%2C_Nuevo_Laredo_15b6.html" title="Edit section: Cribs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cribs</span></h3>
<p>The cribs represent a clear example of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_enterprise.html" title="Free enterprise">free enterprise</a> within the vice trades. For a variety of reasons, many prostitutes work from cribs rather than the brothels, including those who are recent arrivals, or who are less willing to provide the full range of services expected of brothel prostitutes (such as full nudity during intercourse, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>, etc.). Other crib prostitutes may be older or less attractive and are therefore less successful within the brothels and instead ply their trade with passing males more easily from a crib. The freelance prostitutes of the cribs rent the space and they sleep there during the day. They may also share the crib with other <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_workers.html" title="Sex workers">sex workers</a> (many of whom may be family members). Local males constitute the primary customer base of sex workers operating in cribs and prices are generally less than 150 <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_peso.html" title="Mexican peso">pesos</a> ($15 <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollars_0814.html" title="United States dollars">U.S. dollars</a>) for <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy%27s_Town%2C_Nuevo_Laredo_15b6.html" title="Edit section: Cantinas and bars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cantinas and bars</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantina.html" title="Cantina">cantinas</a> and bars constitute a significant component of the economy. Indeed, in some regards, they are the backbone of night-time entertainment in Boy's Town. Most of the cantinas do not operate as brothels. Instead, they are venues for inexpensive drinks (usually just beer and <a href="../../../t/e/q/Tequila.html" title="Tequila">tequila</a>), live music, and very importantly, dancing. Some are staffed with women who dance with customers for a few <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pesos.html" title="Pesos">pesos</a>. The cantinas provide an inexpensive environment for local males (and occasionally couples) to relax, listen to <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia.html" title="Cumbia">Cumbia</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norte%C3%B1o.html" title="Norteño">Norteño</a>, or <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranchera.html" title="Ranchera">Ranchera</a> music, and dance into the wee hours. Several of the cantinas (specifically <i>Alice</i>, <i>Cherokee</i>, <i>El Cielo del Muerto</i>, and <i>El Ocho</i>) are patronized by off-duty prostitutes and their boyfriends and/or husbands during the early morning hours. While these bars are usually opened by 8 p.m. they are almost deserted until 3 a.m. at which time the prostitutes and other customers drop in to 'let off steam' before heading home around sunrise. Most foreigners are likely completely unaware that these bars serve this function because they appear deserted for most of the night.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy%27s_Town%2C_Nuevo_Laredo_15b6.html" title="Edit section: Transvestite bars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transvestite bars</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestite</a> bars are an interesting phenomenon in their own right. Some are brothels catering to clients who seek liaisons with transvestites, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgendered.html" title="Transgendered">transgendered</a> individuals, or <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuals.html" title="Homosexuals">homosexuals</a>. Customers are almost exclusively local males. However, the bars serve a dual purpose in that they provide venues for transvestites to dress up and go out on the town. They can meet, chat and dance with other transvestites and homosexuals, and a few may also engage in sexual relations on the premises. These bars are generally not frequented by foreigners, but on occasion a tourist may stumble into one of these bars only to be greeted with significant enthusiasm from the other patrons.</p>

<p>A wide range of additional commercial services are available in addition to Boy's Town's entertainment facilities. There are a number of small restaurants and street eateries catering to patrons visiting the bars and brothels, and individuals who live and work in there. Some of the restaurants remain open 24 hours. Other services include small convenience stores, clothing stores, seamstress shops that tailor outfits for the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_workers.html" title="Sex workers">sex workers</a>, and a photo studio. In as much as these businesses serve the compound’s daytime as well as nocturnal residents, they make it feel and look much like a typical neighborhood.</p>

<p>While accurate figures of the total number of individuals residing in the Boy's Town are not available, it is clear that it ranges into the hundreds at any given time. A large number of sex workers reside in the brothels, cribs, or other rented rooms. Some of the workers live with their boyfriends and/or husbands in these rooms. Furthermore, several bar owners or managers live in there. From a spatial standpoint, most of the rooms for rent are located on the northern fringe or in interior areas located behind the cantinas and cribs.</p>

<p>The internal structure of Boy's Town displays discrete spatial and social organization. Indeed, establishments and services exhibit a typical <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance_decay.html" title="Distance decay">distance decay</a> pattern. All but one of the primary brothels are located near the entrance, secondary brothels and cantinas are located farther from the entrance, and the transvestite bars are concentrated at the far end of the compound. Even the cribs exhibit a distance-decay pattern in that the younger more attractive prostitutes occupy cribs on the central lane (Cleopatra Street), whereas older, or less attractive women rent cribs on the south most lane or in the back near the transvestite bars. This pattern is primarily a function of rental rates for the cribs; being less expensive in the southwest corner of the compound. In conclusion, the spatial structure reflects the influence of both commercial and social forces.</p>

<p>From a stability standpoint, employment in prostitution is more transitional and seasonal than other occupations within the Boy's Town. For example, most of the waiters, bartenders and shopkeepers retain their jobs for years, if not decades. Indeed, some of the waiters have been working in the same bars for as much as 30 years. These individuals also have fairly set schedules and their employment reflects very little seasonality. In contrast, most prostitutes work in Boy's Town for no more than two to three years; usually in times of severe economic need. Approximately 30% stay between 5 to 8 years, and only 5% may stay for as much as ten years (becoming infamous fixtures in some of the brothels). Prostitutes also tend to work during specific periods and travel frequently between their home states in Mexico and Nuevo Laredo. Many work just weekends and return via autobus to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterrey.html" title="Monterrey">Monterrey</a> or elsewhere in interior Mexico (especially on Sunday mornings). Some work for several weeks each month, while others come for several months each year. In other words, a large number of the sex workers migrate temporarily to the <i>zona</i> at fairly consistent intervals (be it for a few days each week, a few weeks per month, or a few months per year). Generally, prostitutes from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterrey.html" title="Monterrey">Monterrey</a> adopt the weekly schedule, whereas those from farther south utilize the longer interval patterns. Most prostitutes arrive as a result of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_migration.html" title="Chain migration">chain migration</a>. In other words, they typically follow the migration of family members (e.g., sisters, cousins, etc.) or acquaintances who already work in Boy's Town. Therefore, they are usually somewhat familiar with the employment options and their spatial organization upon arrival. It is also important to note that all of the prostitutes in Boy's Town are independent operators in that they have no obligation to serve particular clients, and they do not work for <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madam.html" title="Madam">madams</a> or <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pimps.html" title="Pimps">pimps</a>. In addition, minimum age restrictions are rigorously enforced by the municipal authorities, and any under-age sex workers who happen to show up will be rapidly removed by brothel owners and/or the municipal police.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that the presence of Boy's Town is often a source of embarrassment for some of Nuevo Laredo’s residents. Those individuals who do not utilize the services of the compound usually prefer to ignore its existence, or may suggest that it is not very popular or in a serious state of decline. Others argue for its removal from the city altogether. However, contrary to these opinions, it is heavily utilized by a significant number of local townsfolk (predominantly working-class males). In addition, large numbers of foreigners visit the Boy's Town; especially truck drivers, ranchers, and hunters. Estimates of the number of prostitutes working vary considerably, and estimates of the number of patrons who utilize Boy's Town for entertainment are even less reliable. Nonetheless, according to one local municipal health official, there are approximately 800 prostitutes working in Boy's Town (albeit not at the same time). It is important to note that the recent upswing in drug-related violence in Nuevo Laredo has, for the most part, not been played out within the confines of the Boy's Town. Most of the killings and assassinations of police officers have occurred in downtown Nuevo Laredo, in various residential neighborhoods, or on highways leading into the city from the interior of Mexico. However, the impacts of the drug trade have for many years reached into Boy's Town in the form of consumption. Significant numbers of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_workers.html" title="Sex workers">sex workers</a> and clients may consume drugs on a recreational basis. Indeed, the Boy's Town is one of the prime locations for the purchase of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>. Scholarly analysis of the Boy's Town has been limited to a sociological study in the 1970s (Stevenson 1975) and a geographical survey in the early 1990s (Arreola and Curtis 1993). However, Boy's Town presents a valuable opportunity to evaluate the interrelationships of vice trades, spatial organization, community opinion, sociological patterns, and frontier economic patterns.</p>
