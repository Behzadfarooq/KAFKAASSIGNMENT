<p>Also I discoverd a musical version of the Movie and the info I placed on that article has been deleted. It had very little do do with Actionfolksinger so I'm curious as to why that happend.Boffotaco 20:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I might understand deleting Actionfolksinger. I can see where people would think it was too obscure. What I don't understand is why the addition of the musical version of Spider Baby was taken off the Spider Baby page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that the person who reverted your edits thought it was linkspam or basic advertising. In my point of view, I don't think that addition you made is particularly useful since it's a local musical production, not some big Broadway production. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#f00"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="background:#f00;color:#009"><b>kid</b></span><span style="background:#009;color:#0a0"><b>64</b></span></a> 00:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, linking to the myspace page of a community theater production isn't very encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 01:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now hang on just a second. Just because it was Bakersfield doesn't mean it wasn't a professional production. Also the Jesus Christ Super Star and Jekyll &amp; Hyde soundtracks floated around the ether for years before their broadway debut. The fact is there is a musical out there based on Spider Baby. Why shouldn't the fans of that movie or horror fans get to know about it? Boffotaco 08:17, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also I didn't know there was another Actionfolksinger article. I found his comic books at a convention.Boffotaco 08:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You should read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Providing a few independent reviews would be a start. Also, I not quite sure if they apply, but check out <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>.

<dd>Cross-posting your reply is not something bad, in fact, I think it's beneficial. I always cross-post, as it serves as a reference for both parties in a conversation. There are times when people forget about messaging another user. There are times when other users don't look back at my user talk page, and they only remember again once I post my message on their talk page. I just think it simplifies things a bit. And I also know a number of fellow admins and users that do the same. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#f00"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="background:#f00;color:#009"><b>kid</b></span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#0a0"><b>64</b></span></a> 19:25, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay so the comic book and the musical should be discussed by multiple outside independent sources and at present they each only have one. See that makes sense. I don't know if you're into musicals but I just bought the soundtrack. It's pretty good. Not very musical-ish. More of a concept CD. See I got blinded by fandom. I'm a huge fan of the movie and thought other fans would want this info. When I found out there was a musical version my geek antenna went *boing*. So let's say hypothetically that it did get mentioned and talked about on more than one site. I'm going to assume myspace doesn't count because it's all vanity. How many other sites in your opinion should it be mentioned on and what kind of sites should they be? Boffotaco 17:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Preferably established sites, that have a reputation in the Internet community. Like you said, MySpace is just complete advertising and vanity, so that doesn't count. But say it was reviewed by some notable state newspaper, then it's possible that adding that would be fine. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#f00"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="background:#f00;color:#009"><b>kid</b></span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#0a0"><b>64</b></span></a> 19:25, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay that covers the Spider Baby soundtrack now what about the Actionfolksinger comic book? It's out of print so reviews are out. It's on an internationally recognized comic book resource site but as you said that's only one. If it got talked about on say two more would it then be able to get it's block lifted? Thanks for the help by the way.Boffotaco 20:13, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this one is already closed. The Actionfolksinger comic book is mentioned only on that one <i>independent</i> resource site. I don't know if it's a particularly notable site, so I can't help you there. However, just by doing a Google search, I can see that just doing a Google search only yields 504 hits, a very very small amount. Also, the article links to no other articles, which can lead to verifiability issues. I protected the article itself from being re-created because it had already been deleted three times because users kept making the article. Maybe one day if the comic book becomes immensely popular, then I would reconsider. And don't feel like your questions are a burden or something. It's good to get involved and be curious toward the actions of other users. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#f00"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="background:#f00;color:#009"><b>kid</b></span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#0a0"><b>64</b></span></a> 20:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wait there were three other times the article got put up? Doesn't that speak to a certain popularity? I only tried once so it seems more people than me have heard of it. The site itself is notable and very popular in that world of comic books. I'm assuming you're not a fan. The article I put up linked to Spider Baby and Jack Hill since the author wrote the music for the show and collaborated with Jack Hill. But as you say as of now the man and his work is too obscure.Boffotaco 21:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
