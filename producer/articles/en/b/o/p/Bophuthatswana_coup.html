<p>In 1990 State-President <a href="../../../f/2E/w/F.W._de_Klerk_5d88.html" title="F.W. de Klerk">F.W. de Klerk</a> began negotiations to end apartheid, unbanning the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_National_Congress_8427.html" title="African National Congress">African National Congress</a> and releasing <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> from prison. This led to a growth in support for far-right parties among the ruling <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner.html" title="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> minority, some of whom opposed the end of apartheid and joined organisations such as the AWB and AVF. The negotiators at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park, Johannesburg, agreed on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">27 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> as the date for the first election allowing all of South Africa's citizens to vote. It was clear that the ANC would win these elections.</p>
<p>Bophuthatswana was one of several nominally independent homelands in which blacks had to live under <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>. At the time the leader was <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucas_Mangope_f2ce.html" title="Lucas Mangope">Lucas Mangope</a>, an aging and autocratic leader.</p>
<p>Mangope had made clear at the 1993 Kempton Park negotiations that Bophuthatswana would remain independent of the new and integrated South Africa and that he would not allow the upcoming multiracial elections to take place in his country. This led to increasing opposition from the citizens of Bophuthatswana. Mangope had previously used his Defence Force and Police to suppress protests, and had been accused of police brutality when a student protest was suppressed by his police force.</p>
<p>In February 1994, a Crisis Commission was held when heads of 52 government departments had gone on strike. This caused almost the entire Bophuthatswanas public services to collapse, including the Health Service, due to nursing staff striking. 30,000 teachers went on strike.</p>
<p>Mangope's Defence Force and Police were on the brink of mutiny because many of them were in favour of re-integration into a democratic South Africa. The forces had been abused by the people, physically and verbally, had their homes and families attacked and found it increasingly hard to remain loyal to Mangope. Mangope refused to relent on his policy of keeping Bophuthatswana independent. By this stage widespread rioting and looting broke out, including the burning of the Mega City shopping mall in Mmabatho. Mangope decided to call on outside forces to restore order.</p>
<p>On Tuesday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">8 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> he invited General <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constand_Viljoen_8899.html" title="Constand Viljoen">Constand Viljoen</a>, then head of the right-wing, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Volksfront_945a.html" title="Afrikaner Volksfront">Afrikaner Volksfront</a>, to a meeting of the heads of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, Police, National Intelligence Service and Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>It was concluded that Viljoen would use militiamen to defend certain government locations in Bophuthatswana if the situation deteriorated. On the following Tuesday, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, the Bophuthatswana parliament was planning to meet to discuss, again, the possibility of re-integration. However if necessary he would call on Viljoen sooner because the scheduled ANC invasion<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> was planned for the weekend of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>. Yet Mangope made it clear that he wouldn't tolerate the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaner_Weerstandsbeweging_2c69.html" title="Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging">Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging</a> being present because they were regarded as racist and over-violent. Viljoen was regarded as a more moderate right-wing leader, and was respected as the former head of both the South African Army (from 1976-1980) and the entire <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Defence_Force_b00b.html" title="South African Defence Force">South African Defence Force</a> (1980-1985).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/p/Bophuthatswana_coup.html" title="Edit section: The Invasion and AWB involvement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Invasion and AWB involvement</span></h2>
<p>By Thursday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a> the situation had severely deteriorated and Mangope was advised to leave Bophuthatswana for his own safety. He left via personal helicopter at 2 p.m. that day and returned to his tribal homeland of Motswedi.</p>
<p>Later on that afternoon a group of anti-Mangope policemen took a memorandum to the Bophuthatswana embassy to South Africa and gave it to the ambassador, Professor Tjaart Van Der Walt, calling for Bophuthatswana to be re-integrated into South Africa, against Mangope's orders. By late afternoon virtually all policing in Bophuthatswana was ended. Only the Defence Force remained to maintain order.</p>
<p>Following another group of policemen joining student protests and reports of ANC troops<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> on the Bophuthatswana borders Mangope asked Viljeon and the Afrikaner Volksfront 'Boere People's Party' to keep order in Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p>The AVF were hastily rallied and mobilised, under the command of retired SA Colonel J. Breytenbach. It was, however, under the command of Commandant Douw Steyn that they were escorted by the Bophuthatswana Defence Force to an Air Force base on the outskirts of <a href="../../../m/m/a/Mmabatho.html" title="Mmabatho">Mmabatho</a>, early on Friday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile both the AWB and SA Defence Force had been mobilising and moving in, the SA Defence Force to protect their embassy and the lives and interests of any South African nationals in the area. The majority of the AWB forces involved in the Bophuthatswana Coup had been called in from the towns of Ventersdorp (the AWB's HQ), Witbank and Rustenberg in teh Western Transvaal. Although there was troops involved from other places, such as Nabroomspruit.</p>
<p><br />
While the AVF had been mobilising, on the evening of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, a contingent of AWB members had gathered outside <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafikeng.html" title="Mafikeng">Mafikeng</a>. An even larger contigent were at a border post near Rooigrond.</p>
<p>That evening Colonel Antonie Botse asked AWB leader <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Terre%27Blanche_6f6e.html" title="Eugene Terre'Blanche">Eugene Terre'Blanche</a> and his men to leave but Terre'Blanche refused to take orders from a Colonel. During the night from <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, Jack Turner of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force re-itereated Botse's request but Terre'Blanche, falsely, stated that Mangope had requested his presence, although Mangope denied it to Turner. It was agreed that the AWB could remain in the area but that Terre'Blanche was himself to leave and that the men were under the command of Breytenbach and Steyn, not Terre'Blanche, and additionally that they were to remove all AWB insignia from their clothing.</p>
<p>During the evening of negotiations some 37 people were killed, allegedly by the AWB. The next morning the AWB joined the AVF convoy to the air base. Interestingly General Nicolaas Fourie, one of the 3 AWB commandos killed in an incident on their way out of Mmabatho, had told Terre'Blanche that it was unwise to move into the airbase. They were sent to guard various places, however many blacks in the Bophuthatswana Defence Force had threatened to attack the AWB and AVF because they had supported Mangope only on the terms that the AWB wouldn't be involved and they were upset about the 37 deaths, allegedly inflicted by the AWB. A journalist present (who later went on to write the Bang Bang Club) said that one Boer present had remarked, "Ons is 'n op kaffirskiet piekniek", Afrikaans for a <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir.html" title="Kaffir">kaffir</a> shooting picnic.</p>
<p>From 12.00 to 13.00 the AWB forces left the air force base in Mmabatho without an escort and despite promising to remove all AWB insignia and work under Steyn and Breytenbach they did neither of these things and drove through both Mmabatho and Mafikeng and shot many civilians, it was during their departure that a violent incident occurred, which is detailed below.</p>
<p>The AVF left at 16.00 on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a> and were escorted out via a route which saved them contact with the general public.</p>

<p>The single most publicised event of the coup was the killing of three wounded AWB members who were shot dead at point-blank range in front of journalists by a Bophuthatswana police constable, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontlametse_Bernstein_Menyatsoe_5738.html" title="Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatsoe">Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatsoe</a>.</p>
<p>AWB Colonel Alwyn Wolfaardt, AWB General Johannes Fourie and Veldkornet (Field Cornet) Jacobus Stephanus Uys were driving a blue Mercedes at the end of a convoy of AWB vehicles, firing into a crowd of Bophuthatswanan civilians. Members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force returned fire and hit the driver of the car, Nicolaas Fourie, in the neck, another gunman, Alwyn Wolfaardt, in the arm and the remaining gunman, Jacobus Uys, in the leg. When Wolfaardt got out of the car and waved a pistol, a Bophuthatswana police officer quickly took his pistol. Another policeman tried to fire on journalists but his rifle jammed and it was taken from him by another policeman. The wounded survivor Alwyn Wolfaardt waved a pistol but was advised not to start shooting by nearby journalists.</p>
<p>Menyatsoe approached and spoke to Wolfaardt, asking if he was a member of the AWB. Wolfaardt confirmed this, saying they came from <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboomspruit.html" title="Naboomspruit">Naboomspruit</a>, and pleaded for his life and the lives of the other two wounded AWB members. Menyatsoe then shot the three wounded men dead at point blank range with an R4 rifle, saying "what are you doing in my country". The shooting was captured by the watching journalists and broadcast worldwide.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/p/Bophuthatswana_coup.html" title="Edit section: Amnesty hearing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amnesty hearing</span></h3>
<p>Menyatsoe applied for amnesty at a <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_%28South_Africa%29_a6f7.html" title="Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TRC) hearing in August 1999, on the grounds that the killings were politically motivated. The application was opposed by the Wolfaardt, Uys and Fourie families, and Manyatsoe was cross-examined by AWB leader <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Terre%27Blanche_6f6e.html" title="Eugene Terre'Blanche">Eugene Terre'Blanche</a>. Menyatsoe claimed that his emotions were raised due to his seeing a wounded mother, who had been hit when the AWB had fired from their vehicles into a nearby crowd. According to other journalists dozens of paramilitaries had been firing into mud huts along the road out of Bophuthatswana. Terre'Blanche pointed out that the three soldiers were wounded by the time Menyatso shot them and that by that point posed no threat. Menyatso claimed that he acted on his own devices due to the absence of a commanding officer. Terre'Blanche countered that he couldn't claim he acted as a policeman because his function was to protect high-ranking government officials, i.e. Mangope, that he was a part of a mutiny, and that the AWB and AVF were an ally of Mangope's regime brought in to quell rioting and suppress the mutiny.</p>
<p>Menyatsoe was granted amnesty by the TRC.</p>
