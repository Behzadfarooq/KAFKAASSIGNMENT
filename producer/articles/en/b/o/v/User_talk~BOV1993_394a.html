	    <p>Hi, firstly, it really alarms me to be talking to someone who might suddenly say that I should be killed, or my spouse or child, or someone else, based on their race! If you are really 13 or 14 years old, that sort of hatred-filled outburst makes your interest in far-right extremist topics <b>very</b> worrying. I hope it doesn't show the real reason for your interest. However, you have offered to apologise, and I'll give you some credit for that.

<p>As I've already stated I'm sorry, however just because your politics differ from mine it doesn't mean that you can justifiably say that right- wing politics are 'bad' as a whole. Yet that's a seperate issue, as for killing your family I don't know if you're white, black, indian or coloured so you're saying that I would want to kill you. I'll keep that opinion to myself, but for now I don't even know who you are, okay.</p>

<dd>Thank you for making an apology, whether or not I can <i>accept</i> your apology and say all is OK, I don't know - you did after all make a remark tantamount to a death threat against my son. This is something that I imagine people would normally just refer to the police. However, seeing you say you are only 13, and I would like to take it on good faith that your apology is sincere and that you are someone who may be able to make good objective contributions to Wikipedia, I will try to make some sort of useful response for you. OK then, some of my thoughts...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>When I was 13 I was in a school filled with mostly "white" "caucasian" students and teahcers. I may have topped most of my subjects, but when it came to a compassionate understanding of other people, particularly of people from other backgrounds, ethnicities, (or "races" if you like) I was really ignorant. And I mean REALLY ignorant. Really dumb. I thought it was funny to call the one Chinese guy "slanty eyes". I am embarrassed that I ever was like that, ashamed. Since then I have been lucky to travel the world, (including the UK), and to study with, and to live amongst and work with people from all corners of the globe. Now I hardly even see different 'races' or hear 'accents'. I am lucky to be able to participate and enjoy all the customs, culture, music and food this wide world has to offer. I hope one day you will be able to say the same thing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your political opinions, I guess you are entitled to them. However I'm not sure that anyone engaging in genuine political conversation could objectively say that making anonymous death threats against children based on their race is a useful thing to do. In fact I would suggest that racist comments and racist behaviour serve no useful purpose, and are not given much credence by anyone other than other racists. Comments like "White Power!" etc are only going to damage the progress of any genuine political agenda.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK maybe you will think about my comments, or maybe you will dismiss me, I can't control that. However I hope one day you will be more open-minded, maybe make a few friends from far off places, and feel less hatred. In fact, if you ever come to Australia (and are old enough) I would be happy to shout you a beer and you can see whether I really am someone who is, to quote you, "responsible for the destruction of the white race".

<p>You seem like a nice guy, I'm feeling kind of guilty now you see because when I say things upsetting to people they usually come back all defensive and I don't feel guilty but you've kind of 'disarmed' me. As for travelling the world, I've been to a lot of places in Europe, I lived in Germany but I see your point.</p>
<p>To be honest I'm a fairly reasonable guy to most people of different cultures, due to some of my less politically correct opinions most people are suprised when I know a fair amount about where they come from.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're being understanding of what I said, at least it shows I haven't hurt you too badly inside. To be honest I need to stop saying these things to people over the internet because I always end up feeling a bit guilty at the end of it all.</p>
<p>Anway I'm really sorry for what I said and even if Zaian hadn't involved himself in this it would've played on my mind enough and I'd have come and apolgised anyway.</p>
<p>Likewise if ever you're in England.</p>

<p>I've blocked you from editing for the comments you made to RevJohn. Wikipedia has a zero tolerance policy against death treats and racial comments and people are usually banned indefinitely for such offenses, but since you confessed I've reduced this block to one month.</p>
<p>Death threats are taken extremely serious so you should understand that just saying sorry isn't enough to make things all right again. If you sit this block out, you're welcome to return to edit Wikipedia after it expires provided such attacks never happen again. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:53, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. Thank you but please reduce it to two weeks, I spend so much time on wikipedia and I do add a lot to it and I could've probably got away with creating a new account and pretending that I was an entirely new user so please, in return for my decency and honesty, could the ban be reduced slightly?</p>

<dd>BOV1993, don't try to edit anonymously or pretend to be someone else - you won't get away with it. It will just waste other people's time, and you will probably end up being blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 20:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zaian please stay out of this, I've already had the pleasure of your interference regarding RevJohn, you've already deemed my behaviour as 'disgusting' so what makes you think I'll take your advice? Would you like to be called disgusting by someone?</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I think I need to keep an eye on things. After you started contacting me quite frequently, I identified that User:Williamdevino, User:JK2, User:JBAK, and many anonymous IP addresses were most likely the same person, making racist comments and death threats. By that time you'd already been blocked once, for behaviour which fully deserved to be called digusting. I alerted the administrators notice board to one of User:JBAK's edits, and they unanimously blocked you again. You then told me you had been "allowed back" as User:BOV1993 (by whom?) and that you would apologise to RevJohn, but you didn't do that until I prompted you. I warned you that your best bet was to edit nicely, otherwise lots of administrators would be more than happy to block you. You didn't lie low, you got upset with RevJohn and me, and someone did block you (without my prompting this time). You're lucky to have got away with only a one-month block. You will probably be blocked permanently unless you quieten down, act less touchy, show that your apology is sincere, and understand that your behaviour was completely unacceptable. I know you're going to hate taking advice from me, but you're the only person who can determine whether you're ever allowed back on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 21:35, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes well you know what I've probably made over 100 death threats/ racist comments or other acts of vandalism/ disruption but I've also added much to wikipedia. I'm sorry for what I said to RevJohn, we've discussed it and I'm also deeply sorry for any other vandalism I've perpetrated, I must admit that I wasn't au faux with all wikipedia's devices for working out clone users and I've made a resolution to behave. I have no interest in using my other computers (I also have a laptop and other PC) to come on here and disrupt anything. What I said to RevJohn is, I think, in his mind and mine well in the past. My threats were deeply offensive and I've since realised that my private opinions will be kept to youtube and other forums, okay. I intend to continue editting on the Bop Coup and other AWB related articles and I'd like it if after my ban all of my past offenses on all of my accounts and all of my other offenses attatched to my IP address are put into the past? Does this sound reasonable to you?</p>

<p>As for being allowed back it was the account that was blocked in the case of williamdevino and not the IP address.</p>

<p>P.S. RevJohn said he would've referred me to the police? I'm sorry but it's not possible to catch people who commit offenses over the internet, otherwise how do all of these credit card scammers get away with it?</p>
