<p>"A contributing factor seems to have been a change in British laws that allowed a lower temperature sterilization of the protein meal."

<p>The article is seriously lacking for structure. It “dives” into very specific details from the start, providing no comprehensible introduction. At least “Symptoms” section should be added somewhere in the beginning, since the disease is almost unknown in countries with zero cases of BSE. Thank you.</p>
<p>The article, only one for mad cow disease on wikipedia fails to cover the BSE crisis development, the France (worth an estimated £220 million) and then EU boycott of British Beef, followed by the Worldwide ban of British Beef export. The treasury decision to cover farmer costs where cattle were slaughtered at an estimated £4.6 billion for nearly 2,000,000 cattle. The growth and development of this crisis should be covered to make this article complete. 87.82.12.120 21:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)Iain</p>

<dd>Probably can be detected by some scaning methods as CT or MRI, where you can see the structure of brain without the need to cut it out. These methods are quite expensive and you need the people to stay without moving for a long time, which makes them impossible for use by cattle ...</dd>

<p>I did not see in the article if it was listed as to food preperation. If people cook the meat well done, can they still get mad cow disease? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandeandy_c346.html" title="User:Grandeandy">Grandeandy</a> 01:51, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it's well understood what role cooking might have in reducing (or eliminating) the pathogenesis of vCJD, I believe the scientific community is still divided on the question (a quick scan of the US CDC pages on BSE and vCJD turns up nothing re: food preparation). Infectious prion material may withstand thorough cooking for all we know.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I found this on the USDA website: "<i>Will cooking (including microwave cooking) kill the BSE agent?</i> Current scientific research indicates that cooking will not kill the BSE agent."<a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy_Mad_Cow_Disease/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy_Mad_Cow_Disease/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> They don't give any further references.</dd>

<dd>Probably cooking won't kill the BSE prions, because you need a temperature of 400 °C to do so.</dd>

<p>The prions involved in TSE's (including BSE, CJD, nvCJD etc) have the ability to survive in excess of 1100°F, therefore no amount of cooking, nor the "steam boiling process" will destroy the prion(s) and render infected material suitable for consumption.</p>

<p>I would suggest someone peek into Promedmail.org.</p>
<p>That prions cause BSE is more controversial than this article suggests. There is credible scientific evidence that prions are a result of BSE not its cause. There are at least two other credible hypothesis with good scientific evidence to explaining the cause of BSE/TSE and nvCJD. Organophosphate posioning, which is already known to produce similar brain lesions. Excess Managnese causing a copper deficiency is another possible explaination.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Credible scientific evidence is present both against and for the prion hypothesis. The fact that cannibalism of infected cattle is the main mode of transmission smacks of other prion diseases, particularly <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuru.html" title="Kuru">kuru</a> in humans, occurring in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fore.html" title="Fore">Fore</a> tribe of New Guinea via ritual cannibalism of the brains of ancestors. Prions do not have to be the known cause. The cause of <a href="../../../a/l/z/Alzheimer%27s_disease.html" title="Alzheimer's disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> may be due to one of two proteins, or to environmental <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>. This does not make the amyloid cascade hypothesis any less valid as the <i>most likely cause</i> of Alzheimer's disease. We do not yet understand enough about the way prions work, and this is probably what has led to the statement above.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, the organophosphate theory states that prions are the infective agents, which again resembles the beta amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease (see <a href="http://www.positivehealth.com/permit/Articles/Environment/organo.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.positivehealth.com/permit/Articles/Environment/organo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.positivehealth.com/permit/Articles/Environment/organo.htm</a> for the reference). Organophosphates are simply one way for these prions to be generated.</dd>
<dd>Also, how does excess <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manganese.html" title="Manganese">manganese</a> cause a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> deficiency? True, radioactive <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strontium.html" title="Strontium">strontium</a> can replace <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcium.html" title="Calcium">calcium</a> in bone due to their similar chemical properties and oxidation states. However, manganese oxidation states tend to be higher than those of copper.</dd>
<dd>Finally, look at the epidemiology. How could "epidemics" of BSE occur due to excess manganese? I doubt that large quantities of manganese suddenly appear in feed all through the United Kingdom.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>According to <a href="http://madcow.pamrotella.com/" class="external text" title="http://madcow.pamrotella.com/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, "UK's Mad Cow outbreak immediately followed the government's attempt to eradicate the parasite warble fly from cattle. Most farmers were required to treat their cows' spines and skulls with Phosmet, an organophosphate pesticide."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The article seems to place the blame for BSE squarely on the shoulders of the United Kingdom, but the occurrence of a case in the US demonstrates that the same procedures (viz. slaughterhouse feed meal) are probably being carried out by at least some US farmers.</dd>

<p>There have never been any confirmed cases of a communicable prion disease, and In Britain there <b>should</b> be an epidemic of vCJD from consumption of BSE beef by now; this has not yet materialized.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's simply ridiculous to say that there are no confirmed cases of a communicable prion disease. Scrapie, Kuru and BSE and transmissible mink encephalopathy have all been transmitted in laboratory experiments. Moreover, there is a voluminous body of research, beginning with the research for which <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Prusiner_4192.html" title="Stanley Prusiner">Stanley Prusiner</a> won his Nobel Prize, detailing the involvement of the "prion protein" (PrP) specifically in TSE transmission. Prusiner has succeeded in inducing the disease in lab animals simply by modifying their PrP gene, and he has shown that once the disease is thus induced, it can be transmitted to other lab animals. As for the claim that there "should be an epidemic of vCJD by now," the number of human cases thus far (143, last time I checked) is perfectly within the range that scientists predicted in 1996 when the scientific evidence first appeared showing that BSE had passed into humans. At that time, leading scientists involved in TSE research stated that the number of cases in humans could end up being anywhere between a few dozen and a few million. 143 falls within that range (thankfully, near the low end). Given the long incubation period for TSEs, however, it is still possible that there may eventually be thousands of cases in humans. Hopefully that won't happen, but even if the total stops at 143, the results will be consistent with the prion hypothesis.</dd>

<p>The fact is that even vegetarians have contracted vCJD, but out of caution the British Health Services did not wish to rule out the possibility that some form of BSE could be transmitted to humans through consumption.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm aware of one vegetarian who contracted vCJD in the UK. Maybe there are others I don't know about. The one I know of was a girl who worked in a pet shop where she came into frequent contact with animal feed derived from rendered British cattle. It's possible she got the disease through accidentally ingesting pet food (or from inhaling it; some TSE researchers such as Carleton Gajdusek believe that inhalation of dust from meat and bone meal may transmit the disease as easily as eating it). Moreover, some vegetarians actually eat meat surreptitiously or accidentally. In short, the existence of vCJD in a couple of vegetarians doesn't really tell us enough to seriously challenge the prion hypothesis.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beef, in fact, does have many problems as a food source, and it might be a good thing to be aware of potential risks, however, consumption of BSE cattle alone is almost certainly not a valid threat for vCJD.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's ridiculous to say that consumption of BSE cattle is "almost certainly" not a valid thread for vCJD, in light of the fact that every leading health agency and scientist involved in studying TSEs says that BSE cattle almost certainly <b>are</b> the source of vCJD. This sentence is approximately as defensible as saying that the earth "almost certainly" does not revolve around the sun!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Scrapie in sheep has been known for many years, and some few Elk in Montana and Wyoming also suffer from a similar condition. Professor Alan Ebringer, Kings College, London has studied the problem and found a potential link between Multiple Sclerosis and BSE; vCJD could be a more aggressive form of MS and BSE is very possibly a form of MS in cattle: <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kis/schools/life_sciences/life_sci/ebringerR.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kis/schools/life_sciences/life_sci/ebringerR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kis/schools/life_sciences/life_sci/ebringerR.html</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ebringer belongs to a fairly small minority within the scientific community that still doubts the prion hypothesis. His doubts aren't "new information." It would be reasonable to say that a few scientists including Ebringer and Laura Manuelidis at Yale continue to doubt the prion hypothesis, but the mere existence of a few doubters doesn't disprove the hypothesis. As for scrapie in sheep and chronic wasting disease in Montana and Wyoming (and, more recently, Wisconsin), the fact that they've been around for years doesn't in any way invalidate the prion hypothesis. Scrapie and CWD <b>are</b> prion diseases. Many (not all) scientists in fact believe that BSE originated when scrapie passed from sheep into cows!</dd>

<dd>In any case, a discussion of doubts about the prion hypothesis belongs in the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prion.html" title="Prion">prion</a> article before it belongs in the BSE article.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The agency has not chosen to make CJD a reportable disease because "making it reportable is not necessarily directly helpful in surveillance, because in some states where it's reportable you may not get the physician to report it," said Dr. Ermias Belay, CDC's medical epidemiologist working on CJD.</li>

 12/24/2003 U.S. Prepares for Mad Cow Impact - Officials Investigate How Animal May Have Been Infected - 12/24 AP
</pre>
<p><i>The risk to human life is extremely low,</i> Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman told reporters, even as country after country slapped import bans on American beef.</p>
<p>Federal and state-level officials worked to trace the Holstein's history before it came to its last home, Sunny Dene Ranch in Mabton, Wash., in 2001. Agriculture Department chief veterinarian Ron DeHaven said officials have identified two livestock markets in Washington where the animal could have been purchased, but he did not identify them.</p>
<p>Because the brain-wasting disease is usually transmitted through contaminated feed and has an incubation period of four to five years, it is <i>important to focus on the feed where she was born,</i> DeHaven said.</p>
<p><i>Once we have the birth herd, we'll want to know what animals have come into that herd and what animals have left that herd and all the feeding practices for that herd,</i> DeHaven said.</p>
<p>The human form of the disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob, is thought to be contracted by eating meat from an infected animal, specifically from the brain or spinal cord. Officials stressed that these parts of the sick cow were removed before the rest of the carcass was sent to processing plants.</p>
<p>Consumers had a mixed reaction to Tuesday's announcement of the first apparent U.S. case of mad cow disease - formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</p>
<p><i>I'm content to have a freezer full (of beef), said Helen Spinetto of Cambridge, Mass.</i> But if I had to purchase it again, maybe I'd think twice.</p>
<p>However, the mad cow case reinforced the opinions of Barbara Seaton of the Albany, N.Y., suburb of Colonie. She does not eat beef, and said there it will <i>absolutely not</i> be on her holiday table.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, stocks in meatpacking companies and restaurant chains took a hit. Among the losers: McDonald's Corp., Wendy's International and Tyson Foods.</p>
<p>U.S. beef exports totaled $2.6 billion in 2002, with Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Hong Kong the biggest importers. They all have banned U.S. beef, along with at least seven other countries.</p>
<p>Agriculture Department officials told a briefing the cow was culled from its herd and slaughtered Dec. 9, after she became paralyzed, apparently as a result of calving. Preliminary tests showed the cow, believed to about 5 years old, had mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Tissue samples were sent to Britain's Veterinary Laboratories Agencies, a world leader in mad cow identification, for confirmation. <i>We should have a result within a few hours of the initial test,</i> said Steven Edwards, chief executive of the lab in Weybridge, west of London.</p>
<p>Politically, Democrats jumped on Republicans who removed a ban on processing meat from <i>downed</i> animals - those that are ill when they reach the plant - from a massive agriculture spending bill.</p>
<p><i>This is something that's a potential disaster,</i> said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., a leader in supporting the processing prohibition. <i>This was so predictable by anybody following the issue.</i></p>
<p>Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said the mad cow case <i>does not have to result in any widespread panic in our country, because the likelihood of there being any effect on humans is extremely remote.</i></p>
<p>Contaminated feed has been blamed in other countries for carrying the misshapen animal proteins, called prions, that can transmit mad cow. The United States since August 1997 has banned the use of cow and sheep byproducts for animal feed.</p>
<p>Investigators were at processing plants in Oregon, where meat from the infected cow had been turned into boneless beef, said a spokesman for the Agriculture Department. Authorities want to know where the meat was sent, although they stressed that the cow's brain and spinal cord, the only parts that are considered able to transmit the disease, did not enter the food supply.</p>
<p>The animal was one of 20 slaughtered Dec. 9 at Vern's Moses Lake Meat Co. in Moses Lake, Wash. All 10,410 pounds of beef from those carcasses have been recalled in <i>an abundance of caution,</i> Veneman said.</p>
<p><i>We continue to believe that the risk to human health from this situation is extremely low, and people should continue to feel very confident in the safety of our meat supply,</i> Veneman said.</p>
<p>President Bush, spending Christmas with his family at Camp David, Md., was getting regular updates, a White House spokesman said.</p>
<p>The beef industry sought to reassure Americans.</p>
<p><i>It's important to recognize what we learned from Canadian consumers,</i> Terry Stokes, CEO of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, told reporters. <i>They had confidence in Canadian beef and we feel American consumers will follow accordingly.</i></p>
<p>Canada had an isolated case of mad cow disease earlier this year. The United States banned imports of Canadian beef immediately after that announcement but has gradually begun allowing them.</p>
<p>Investigators are trying to determine whether the case in Canada is linked, a USDA official said, but a connection is unlikely because the animals were of different breeds.</p>
<p>Consumer activists expressed concern. <i>Consumer confidence in the safety of the U.S. meat supply will be damaged by the finding of a domestic animal infected,</i> said Carol Tucker Foreman of the Consumer Federation of America.</p>
<p>But Flavius Barker, head of the Tennessee Farm Bureau, said, <i>The isolated finding in Washington state gives no reason for consumers to fear the safety of their beef products.</i></p>

<p>I think this article needa a bit of a tidy up. Three things I would like to change first of all:</p>
<ol>
<li>It states that scientists were "shocked" by the discovery of prions - this is not quite true, the existence of prions had been hypothesised for many years but had been thought highly speculative.</li>
<li>It says that there is no proven link to vCJD, This is really spltting hairs; it would take a hell of a lot to <i>disprove</i> the link. The two diseases are epidemiologically inseparable, have identical PrP<sup>Sc</sup> strain types, and transmission experiments in animals expressing human PrP have pretty much nailed it.</li>
<li>This is heavily biased towards the USA. I think it needs to be more balanced towards the bulk of BSE/vCJD cases, which is probably what people want to read about when they look this up. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurple_b366.html" title="User:Purple">Purple</a> 19:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yo, how come nobody talks about prevention? Does cooking beef thoroughly prevent transmission to humans? What are Europeans doing to stop the spread of the disease amongst their herds?</p>
<p>And contraction... if the method of infection (or whatever you want to call it) is by eating contaminated material, then why do tourists have to have your shoes cleaned at European airports after going out into the countryside?</p>
<p>There's some key details missing here. Plenty of statistics and details on the outbreak itself, but lots lacking in the mechanics of how the disease (or whatever you want to call it) works and the steps that various governments have taken (besides complete bans on beef from countries where "infections" are discovered) to contain/prevent the disease. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> 06:42, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Statemets like "which contain ingredients undreamed of by Mother Nature", are not the sort of neutral language one would expect in an encyclopedia <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelholdsworth_66e3.html" title="User:Joelholdsworth">Joelholdsworth</a> 18:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed the wording to make it sound better. I also wonder about the line that states cattle eat grass and grains in nature. Where do wild cattle get grains? I know cows will eat any thing they can find including brush, trees, fruit, vegetables, etc. 99DBSIMLR 12:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>"It is noticeable that there are no cases reported in Australia and New Zealand where cattle are mainly fed outside on grass pasture" I was under the impression that the lack of cases in australia at least partially came from the quaranteen regulations keeping the diseas out.

<p>german researchers found massive traces (indirect) of radionuclids in tissue of mad cows (source of ionizing radiation). i will try to translate the complete text. i copied this sentence to my notes, so i am able to recreate it daily. they say, maybe the food was irradiated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.15.194.91_5232.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.15.194.91">89.15.194.91</a> (talk) 03:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
