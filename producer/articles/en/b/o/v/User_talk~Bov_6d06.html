<dd>Unfortunately, if Wikipedia is divided between the word of the Bush Admin being 'the truth' and the 'view of the world' and everything else being 'conspiracy theory,' then we're headed into fascism faster than I thought. I'm a 9/11 researcher and as it turns out, there are many like me all over the world. That's why those trying to stop the exposure of the STUDY of what happened on 9/11 by labelling people with derogatory phrases ('conspiracy theorists,' i.e., commie pinko, longhair, reds, etc.) straight out of Whitehouse mouthpieces and criminals, are engaged in a losing effort, even here on Wikipedia. As the lies coming out of the fascist Administration compound daily, the work of their own small army - patriots, wannabe neocons, religious right, Left Icons, disinfo peddlers, agents and others like them - is crushed by the weight of their increasing work load to protect the government version of 'truth' as they go around trying to insert 'conspiracy theory' and 'tinfoil hat' or 'no-plane' into every place that tries to even EXAMINE the evidence. Why not join us, instead of trying to fight us? It's okay to ask questions -- that isn't against the law . . . yet. Might as well enjoy it while we can. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a> 19:48, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read your profile after deleting an entry re. WP use in Iraq as a "conspiracy." I do not think blind acceptance of statements made by those in control of the status quo is a responsible approach, but branding other, unrelated, and comparably minor events conspiracies does not help your argument to be regarded as a researcher in pursuit of the truth. The statements were not contradictory, and the weapons use not illegal. Personally, I do not accept the official claims regarding WTC #7 nor the official claims regarding Flight 93. However, I do not think questioning those claims is what brands many researchers like yourself as conspiracy theorists. It is instead the search for or connection to some alternative motive or perpetrator. Quite clearly not everything on that day happened the way we are led to believe it happened, and whether or not we need to know the truth is a topic for another time (most certainly you have the right to seek that truth if it is important to you) but 9/11 researchers often try to construe their scientific results as something they are not. So flight 93 was shot down, so WTC7 was intentionally demolished, they do not implicate the government in some vast conspiracy against the American people. If you have done the research and decided that there is only one possible explanation, then fine, believe that, but it is not responsible to then make geopolitical leaps of faith and assault without evidence that ultimately terrorists were responsible. That is why many are branded conspiracy theorists. Finally, as a scientist you miss a simple, fundamental concept: it is not the American governments responsibility to inform the general public of the truth. Transparency is anything but a foundational tenet of modern government. It is instead the government's responsibility to protect its citizens and their interests at home and abroad. This is not a quantitative science of numbers and definitive rights and wrongs, but rather a gray area filled with projection and speculation. I applaud your research, but hope that those like you will remember to limit it to the field of science, lest they tread on to tenuous, unfamiliar ground to be ridiculed in the public spotlight by those waiting for them to err.

<p><i>"So flight 93 was shot down, so WTC7 was intentionally demolished, they do not implicate the government in some vast conspiracy against the American people."</i> <a href="http://911review.com/errors/conspiracy.html" class="external text" title="http://911review.com/errors/conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">Vast, no</a>, but conspiracy against the American people, yes. Indeed, if government officials - be they rogue officials or those just thinking they were doing the right thing - knew that the plane was shot down or that Building 7 was demolished, the 9/11 Commission was then either lied to or lied themselves. If the Commission lied on these issues, the entire 'report' is questionable as to its veracity. And if you ask me, producing fake reports, then, to the American public, is a conspiracy against them.</p>
<p><i>"Transparency is anything but a foundational tenet of modern government. It is instead the government's responsibility to protect its citizens and their interests at home and abroad."</i> We pay our government to function, not to lie to us. A government does not have to lie to its people in order to function, not to mention how disrepectful and hypocritical lies are to the people of this country who are giving 'all' for it each day. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a> 01:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Responding to both points: First, it does not imply a conspiracy against the American people, only that a second conspiracy may exist. The two should not be confused. The use of the term against is significant because many of the theories suggested involve the possibility of explicit acts contrary to the immediate interests of the nation and/or its citizens. My point is to rule these out as erroneous because the long term protection of United States interests cannot be in doubt. Truth is for the individual to seek if s/he wishes it. It is not yours or anyone elses duty to publicly expose truth in the name of science for a political motivation and therein lies a contradiction. You would argue against the media as the mouthpiece of a government, but science and politics do not exist in the same realm. You wish to use science to make a political statement; this while not necessarily a mistake, is not your obligation as scientist or researcher. It is also not in the tradition of the enlightment or the scientific method. You must approach your subject without predisposition or presumption. Both of these seem to dissapear with many of these theories. I also do not agree with the logic that if one statement is proven to be a lie all statements must be brought into question. This is not a contrapositive argument where one exception invalidates the entire theory. Only claims dependent upon the prior fallacious claims become subject to dispute. If you are investigating each claim as it is made, that is fine, but do not make the mistake of stating that something is incorrect on page 20 if a lie is told on page 200. Sure there is the possibility there is an error on any given page, but no more or less so because of the one on 200.</dd>

<dd>Second: Your argument is ill informed and based on naivety and hyperbole. We do not pay our government to merely function without direction or motive. We pay our government to protect our interests, our essential liberties, and most of all, the common good. That is not your best interest or my best interest, but the best interests of us all united. Governments lie to their people on a daily basis in order to function and while because it happens is not a justification, it is important to recognize this as the way of the world. Furthermore, under extraordinary circumstances it IS often necessary to lie to one's people in order to function. The ramifications of the admission of shooting down a U.S. civillian aircraft would be staggering such an event would have financial, political, and social repurcussions you may or may not have considered but that would be surely be terrible for this country in the long term. The population would not react rationally and understandingly, but then it is not their job to. It is instead the job of those that we pay to defend us to approach the situation, realize the people are dead either way, and understand that it is a simple cost benefit analysis and that they are better dead in PA than dead in D.C. While this may be something you would like to know the answer to, it is not in the public interest for it to become widely regarded fact and the Flight 93 story is much better for public consumption. It may be a lie, but that does not mean it is wrong. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happyness does not include truth.</dd>

<dd>I can understand personal interest/desire for knowledge, but if you are incapable of understanding the reality of these dangers and the necessity as a nation to defend itself and preserve a stable society, you only exemplify the reasons such covers are concocted and disseminated. And to those giving their all, we do far worse to them every day. Your statement appeals to emotion, not to reason. Hipocracy is a particular talent of the U.S. government (although I'm not particulalrly sure why you claim this in particular is at all hypocriful). In terms of respect, our troops know who and what they fight for, even if they aren't told, cannot understand, or are lied to about the specific motivation. Small evils are perpetraited frequently in the name of the greater good. It is only disrespectful to waste their lives recklessly.

<dd>You respond to my weakest statement, not my strongest. If the strongest fail, the weaker should be a mere trifle. But to your points: Who gave you this fundamental right? Why is it fundamental? Why do you believe you possess this right? This is a common error. Freedom is a fundamental, natural right. Truth is not, it is a modifier. A statement about the world around us. The truth it is either true or false, correct or incorrect, and if it is not so, it is not the truth. Truth is useful in so far as it is conducive toward society building and forming stable, productive relationships. Truth is an excellent way for two unknown party's to gain eachothers trust and work together. As social animals, this is a great benefit for humanity and it forms the premise for much of our modern accomplishment. However, this does not make it a fundamental human right. We may endeavor to create relationships with others predicated on truth, and while truth is in practice very crucial to family, friend, and workplace relationships where the power structure is equivalent (or if not equal, only marginally disproportionate), it is not an expectation of government. Unfortunately, most people make the mistake you made in including government and employers in this list. Yes it is fair and responsible for them to be truthful with you, and a higher body may establish codes of conduct instructing an entity to be forthwith with you, the highest powers are under no compulsion to behave in a similar fashion unless that power is threatened by another body. The United States government as the most powerful governing body in existance, does not need this thing, truth. It propagates a myth of transparency and a facade of truth that is helpful to continued rule, but this is no natural right of its citizens it must protect. Furthermore, yes, their is an objective universe out their to which their is a physical discernable truth about the long billiards-ball chain of events that occurred on Sept. 11th. But there is not an objective discernable truth about why it happened, why decisions were made, and what in the political and human spheres influenced these events. The realm of science and the realm of government DO NOT overlap. Science is fact, cut and dry. There are rarely ever facts when dealing with fractured socialogical structures of millions of people.</dd>

<dd>Make no mistake, I did not tell you to stop looking and accept lies. I would posit there is a right to seek the truth included under the right to freedom. However, this does not mean our political system should be subverted (while somewhere in the constitution and commonly regarded as one, this is not necessarily a right you have as demonstrable through correct understanding of why those who do, walk away in the <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omelas.html" title="Omelas">Omelas</a> scenario). I only asked you to understand that some of these evils might be necessary evils or might have positive outcomes. More than might in fact, I would argue "probably." Tangential links to the CIA aside, you are however, hypocraful in your actions. You intend to do the same thing many governments do by attempting to assert control over the reality of others. But you are an individual or group of individuals. You are not an elected government that other individuals have chosen to shape and mold their subjective realities. You may wish to tell others the truth, but what if they do not wish to know. Religions do this, its called proselytizing, another behavior I am firmly against. The argument under free speech does not hold here given that if you shout loud enough, even if a person does not want to hear, they will be compelled to. In such a case, you would be infringing on others freedoms. Your freedoms should not supercede theirs.</dd>

<dd>Yes, propaganda is propaganda, but it is up to every one to choose for themselves what to believe. It may be irresponsible and unfair of governments to take advantage of those with inferior educations possibly incapable of making an informed decision, but truth could proove just as distructive if the people were not simultaneously well prepared. By advocating conspiracy theories you reveal yourself to those who would discredit you. I choose another path, to decide for myself what is the truth and use this knowledge to my advantage. I do not accept on face value that it is for my own good, I look into it and realize that in fact, is. Furthermore, I dont need to be responsible for the atrocities that are committed in protecting my interests and while some may argue that all that is necessary for evil to win is for good men to do nothing, I would argue that evil already has won. Do not mistake this a statement of futility, just why try to shoot a tank with a BB gun, get a TOW or something.</dd>

<dd>We live in a society far morally/objectively worse than Orwell's, and the society he truly feared was not the obvious one of a socialist or fascist regime might bring, but the hazards the subtextual capitalist world would. When people have nothing, no happyness, they also have nothing to lose. When people actually have something, a color TV, a mercedes, a new toy the Smiths can't afford yet, or the illusion of freedom, they will have something to lose and being risk averse by nature, they will not risk that loss. Of course, this works for all echelons except the very most bottom, and we imprison them. Somewhat near the top, my freedom, while illusory is slightly less corporeal, but the bigger question is why we want freedom; real, true freedom. The freedom I have now, while not anything close to true freedom, feels, at the least.... satisfactory. We will and do have Oceania, et al... They are The United States, The (European) Union, The People's Republic (of China), and the Republic of India (they need a new name). An Arab state is a possibility, but only long after oil matters, and Africa and others may join us eventually. What conspiracy theorists should try to understand is that currently, the U.S. is attempting to make sure there is still a place of power itself at that table 40 years. We will be surpassed as the singular dominant power on earth, the goal is to not become marginalized with our mere 280 million citizens. We sacrifice perhaps 10 years as the sole dominant hyperpower with the hope of a stable, better world, in the future. Neocons may in actuality wish for a lot more, but the result of their strategies will be our seat at the table.</dd>

<p>Bov, if I remember correctly wasn't that you who removed the picture of the WTC7 collapse because of something to do with what the picture implied regarding smoke or something? Check out the picture on this link <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/march2005/180305groundzero.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/march2005/180305groundzero.htm" rel="nofollow">WTC7 Collapse and Analyses</a>. It's the same picture isn't it? Maybe it should go back there in light of recent developments on the page. Whaddya think? <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenaR_f426.html" title="User:SkeenaR">SkeenaR</a> 07:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, Yes, I removed a picture that came from the FEMA or NIST report that showed a HUGE and solid cloud next to WTC7 that they were trying to say was from the fires at WTC7, when we have no evidence that that was the case. Basically, there are some oral history statements with firefighters saying that building had a lot of damage, but although this must have happened over a stretch of 5 + hours, there are NO VIDEOS OR PHOTOGRAPHS of these described fires or the supposed damage. Fires that approach a point where they could bring a building down end up breaking all the windows, turns the metal glowing red, typically has flames shooting out continuously, etc. We have one photo with flames coming out of one floor and that's it as far as significant damage. And the damage written up in the reports doesn't match up with the images. So there is a push for people to try to say that images showing smoke must be from Bldg 7, when we have no evidence to make that inference.</p>
<p>I didn't see that picture on the link you have above . . . The picture is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories#World_Trade_Center_Seven" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories#World_Trade_Center_Seven" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories#World_Trade_Center_Seven</a></p>
<p>It's very bizarre because the smoke ends exactly along the side of 7 and so some people think it's photoshopped. I really just don't think we can say what is producing that smoke given that the whole area was smoking and the strange nature of that smoke ending with the side of the building. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a></p>

<p>Bov - you recently removed a lot of firefighter testimony of severe damage to building seven along with information about laser doppler vibrometers and transits that were used to measure the building's movement along with details about how it's eventual collapse was predicted by those on site hours before it fell. Why did you eliminate this truth from the article? I've put it in twice over the past few months and people keep taking it out. I think a person should be able to come to wikipedia and find truth, not one side of an issue only. If you are a truth seeker then you will accept all truth, not just what you agree with. <a href="../../../r/c/r/User%7ERcronk_fb09.html" title="User:Rcronk">Rcronk</a> 21:20, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; A while ago you added to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_the_9_11_Commission_Report_5ffa.html" title="Criticisms of the 9/11 Commission Report">Criticisms of the 9/11 Commission Report</a> quite a few points under 'Omissions' and 'Inaccuracies'. I and others collected a few references on the talk page to support these. Would you like to draw from that list (and/or from elsewhere) to add references to the article to support the criticisms? If not, I could just drop them in wholesale.</p>
<p>A conern I have is that the article make clear that these are criticisms people have made, without appearing to endorse those criticiams as valid. Of course, arriving at the point of balanced, encyclopedic neutrality, while maintaining verifiable accuracy, is easier to describe than to do. Anyway, the article has kind of languished for a few weeks; maybe adding references will be an improvement we can all agree on. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No doubt that he is anti-Semitic, but that doesn't disqualify him for listing on the page, only non-notability would do that. Thanks for pointing this out to me (it is why I try to stay away from the 9/11 pages, because this sort of stuff makes me very angry), but I am afraid I can't remove him.

<p>Hi; About "Additionally, some 9/11 researchers have expressed concern that Peter Meyer's website hosts articles with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> articles..." which someone just removed. I think it is clearly true that resarchers have expressed that concern, but you might do well to provide a link to researchers actually going on record saying "Anti-Semitism."

I implemented that change. Someone then removed it because it didn't have a citation. I believe that once the issue is cited it will become clear that 'some' do feel offended by antisemitic pages mixing with 9/11 research.

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hi Bov. I saw the edits you made on the Jones page and thought they were good, but wanted to ask if you could clarify something. I'm not sure what this sentence means: <i>He also suggests that non-symmetrical damage and random fires would not have led to the near-symmetrical collapse of WTC 7, cites published accounts of molten metal found at Ground Zero long after the collapses, and his own analyses on WTC Steel samples. -</i> I'm not sure if this is intended to convey the idea that molten metal and his analyses are direct support for his other contention ( fires not leading to the collapse), or if this is a list of 3 unrelated things he talks about in his paper. I guess it is the ", cites" that is throwing me. If you could take a look and clarify it, I would be grateful. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_P._7191.html" title="User:Levi P.">Levi P.</a> 05:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bov. I think I have explained pretty clearly why a paragraph which contains no explicit criticism should not be put in the Crit. section. You don't seem to agree.

<p>Hi Levi P. We seem to disagree on the point of what qualifies as criticism and how explicit a criticism has to be to be in the criticism section. A compromise might be to delete those descriptions altogether, and then the paragraph won't need to be moved to a criticism section. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 06:10, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about we use the definition of criticism as guidance for what is and is not criticism. That is how it is usually done. If we use this criteria, your passage does not qualify. But, since you have already entreated me to "break with precedent" for no reason, am I to assume that you also think we should not use the dictionary definition of criticism? <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_P._7191.html" title="User:Levi P.">Levi P.</a> 23:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Your vote is needed, dont let them delete the template with tricks and edit dispute issues. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me with the template. I'm glad that you are showing interest in the template itself, rather that remove it from the articles. As per the <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template_talk%7E911tm.html" title="Template talk:911tm">Template_talk:911tm</a> page, I was already debating upon leaving <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a> out of this. I haven't really made it to the films and books part yet. Why remove the st911 link? It looks like during the time I've been writing this the links have been restored. I propose that we meet on the [[Template_talk:911tm] page to discuss and come to agreement on what should be included and what should be left out of the template. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 18:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not have an authoritative answer for you, but I can give you some ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>WP requires picures to be ideally those released totally into the public domain. Such pictures include items like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Image%7ESearchlight-Old-Needles-Battery.jpg_321b.html" title="Image:Searchlight-Old-Needles-Battery.jpg">Image:Searchlight-Old-Needles-Battery.jpg</a> which I took myself and released under the licence shown. They can be made even freer, but this type of licence does fine if one is the photographer.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/g/v/Image%7EKGVF-plaques.jpg_a68a.html" title="Image:KGVF-plaques.jpg">Image:KGVF-plaques.jpg</a> is an example of a third party who has released an image into the public domain. Note the summary which states how the image has been released despite having been copyright of another party.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/j/o/Image%7EBjorn-Andresen-The-Boy-Cover-by-David-Bailey-1970.jpg_d98a.html" title="Image:Bjorn-Andresen-The-Boy-Cover-by-David-Bailey-1970.jpg">Image:Bjorn-Andresen-The-Boy-Cover-by-David-Bailey-1970.jpg</a> is an image with a Fair Use Rationale which is restricted to four articles</li>
</ul>
<p>The real message here is to look carefully at the use that wull be made and to show as much evidence as possible of the release into the public domain. Probabaly the image you had permission to upload shoudl have had its permisson quoted, PLUS a Fair Use Rationale stating which article or articles it was fair to use it in.</p>
<p>I hope this helps soemwhat. If you remain unsure I suggest you place {{helpme}} on this page and ask the precise question you need help with of a friendly passing admin. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 19:48, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently, there is lack of effective procedures or guidelines for dealing with the type of cascading procedural maneuvers, however well intended, that exacerbate disagreements, rather than ameliorate escalating tensions. In this particular case, several editors have banded together to push what seems to be a decidedly pejorative pov, not just on this article, but on a number of related articles. The issues at hand are much broader than can be dealt with by simply harping on the 3RR guideline, since they also involve a number of other questionable procedural matters, including scorched Earth AfD tactics. Unfortunately, the broader problems here are now being compounded by seemingly overwrought attention to a specific detail, in this case the 3RR, rather than on mediation of the conflict at hand. Such focus generally tends to compound broader patterns of questionable behavior, rather than neutralizing the conflict. This is clearly a case where gang task force or <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandated_reporter.html" title="Mandated reporter">mandated reporter</a> skills and training would be helpful. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 23:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bov, I think I understand what you're trying to do, but I think it is going to grow out of proportion (and will in any case be a temporary measure.)

<dd>You mean the consensus you have from the same people trying to label everyone who questions the 9/11 attacks as a "conspiracy theorist"? Unfortunately the new template does this also, even more so than the last, which is one reason I oppose it. People who have spent their lives doing scientific research should not be reduced to "conspiracy theorist" because they question the attacks. You further that branding on here by going along with it. It would be best if I could work with you on the template, but I am also opposed to having more than one template, so I'm not sure that could work. If you want to get rid of the other one, that's fine by me, and I would gladly try to work with you on this one. My first suggestion would be to get rid of the title.<a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 22:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will get over there when I get a chance, but for now, Hoffman's page needs to be clear of templates. If you read his work, a lot of his writing debunks the same links you are posting with the template, so it is not appropriate for it to then act as a 'nav tool' on his page. He does support exposing the cover-up, but not through hoaxes and baseless claims . . . using science, instead. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 22:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, with those against you and those for you. Wikipedia works by consensus, and it tends to turn as a community on those who do not work the same way. So, if you want to get your pointg across and your voice heard it is excellent advice to build and reach a consensus. Wikipedia is about "we" never about "I".</dd>

<p>With the various idiosyncratic edits you have made, both to add the 911ct template to articles where it has no conceivable business and to remove both templates from articles where they have relevance, together with both the lack in many cases of edit summary and your use of anonymous IP based addresses (which I agree you declare on your user page) this is looking increasingly like editing to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">point</a>, which is <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">disruptive</a>.</p>

<p>It's a waste of my time to have to endless delete the template which has been explained on Jim Hoffman's page. Why should it be endlessly reinserted on his page when he REFUTES the information on the template? I don't see you explaining why there is no other template on wikipedia which can be said to be placing LINKS TO INFORMATION ON A BIO PAGE WHICH THAT INDIVIDUAL WORKS TO EXPOSE AS FLAWED, HOAXES, AND REFUTED.

<dl>
<dd>Please do not shout. I sense your frustration, but that is no reaosn to use capital letters.</dd>
<dd>Consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hoffman#9.2F11_Guilt:__The_Proof_Is_In_Your_Hands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hoffman#9.2F11_Guilt:__The_Proof_Is_In_Your_Hands" rel="nofollow">this section</a> which says <i>Hoffman produced a section entitled 'Proving Controlled Demolition of World Trade Center Building 7 and the Twin Towers.'[1] In his presentation, Hoffman offers five "features" and then five "proofs" of demolition along with some pointed graphics. "He shows beyond question, I think, that all three Buildings were taken down by different methods of controlled demolition," according to Paul, who added "The Twin Towers were exploded as no buildings have been before or since and about seven hours later World Trade Center Building 7 was imploded in a classic, conventional demolition."</i></dd>
<dd>To me this looks as though he supports the hypothesis. Please see <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_test.html" title="Duck test">Duck test</a>, and realise that, unless I an many others have misinterpreted this section, when I will withdraw with apologies, the man looks like a conspiracy or CDH pusher. So my message to you still stands.</dd>
<dd>Additionally you are removing the template wherever you see it from any article, not just Hoffman. Shouting about one article does not validate your actions on the others. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course he supports the demolition hypothesis (not a "conspiracy," but a hypothesis for the method of destruction of the buildings). But much of the content the templates link to, films like Loose Change, In Plane Site, etc contain a number of hoaxes and significant errors which Hoffman works to expose, not to promote.</dd>
<dd>Here's an analogy. Say you had a bio page. If I said that because you were a Christian you therefore supported the evangelicals, and then put a template for Christians on wikipedia on your bio page which mixed you in with the <a href="../../../7/0/0/700_Club_8d0a.html" title="700 Club">700 Club</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>, you might object. If I then responded that because you were a Christian, that meant I had the right to put them there, you would still object. Especially worse is if you'd written articles exposing the absurdities espoused by the 700 Club but were then to have them in a template on your bio page. Yet for me -- a non-Christian (making a template about Christians, this is the analogous situation to those on wikipedia who do not endorse nor care about the theories but are insistent on making templates about them), I would continue to assert that your differences were too minor to make a case about, and wouldn't understand why it bothered you. Then I would say that you'd have to get consensus to get me to stop putting the template on your bio page which mixed evangelical extremists and profiteering tv programs with moderate people like yourself. Do you get it? <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 20:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whether <i>I</i> get it or not is wholly immaterial. What is material is that you make sufficient well ordered argument to convince the wikipedia community. Your argument is persuasive, but it has not convinced me. That is fine because I am one person only. I am not wholly sure why you have brough a religion into the discussion, but it serves reasonably well as an example.</dd>
<dd>However you have not addressed your edits to remove the template wherever you find or found it, nor those to add it where it had absolutely no business to be. Those are wholly inappropriate and a far more clear cut case than Hoffman (where I accept that you have a case to make).</dd>
<dd>The template has a perfectly valid talk page. Using it to make your point is the most productive thing, I think. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 21:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bov, several people have now contacted you regarding your insistence on adding/deleting these templates from various articles. I note that over the last 20 edits to mainspace by you, 18 of those were either removing (17) or adding (1) these templates.

Your edits are, in every case, being reverted.</p>
<p>While you are not in violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, your editing pattern on this issue has been disruptive and is not acceptable behavior.

Your efforts to include or remove the template are achieving nothing since you are not working towards consensus. Instead, your edits are being undone virtually on sight by several editors.

<dd>The discussion is right there on the template talk page so asserting I haven't attempted constructive avenues is simply false. Take the locked and divisive "conspiracy theory" template off Hoffman's page. Take it off the Demolitions page, which has virtually no instances of that phrase on there and thus is not relevant. I've tried to discuss this but the promoters of the template -- those whose primary goal is to associate anyone questioning 9/11 with the badge of "conspiracy theory," are unwilling to give an inch. These are not unreasonable requests I am making and are supported amongst other editors, not to mention Hoffman himself, for the many reasons I have already explained over and over. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a>

<li>Thank you for pointing that out.

However, what you are doing still constitutes an edit war. The discussion that you have contributed to is still ongoing and has not achieved consensus. Regardless, the discussion at <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template_talk%7E911ct.html" title="Template talk:911ct">Template talk:911ct</a> is largely about the content of the template, not about where that template is used. You continue to edit war over whether this template should be used in various articles. I have reverted your re-removal of the template and am hereby issuing you a final warning; if you continue to edit war in this manner without engaging in a consensus building mechanism (and allowing time for such to conclude) regarding the appropriateness of such a template on the respective pages from which you are removing it, you will be blocked. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've contacted Hoffman and he will be contacting wikipedia himself, directly, regarding the issue of the template on his page with information which he clearly refutes. I have discussed this at length <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jim_Hoffman#.7B.7B911ct.7D.7D_template" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jim_Hoffman#.7B.7B911ct.7D.7D_template" rel="nofollow">here</a> and on my own page in discussion with individuals as well as on the template page and in the deletion discussions. How many discussions does it take? The rule <i>should be</i> that BIO pages should have a "do no damage" bottom line, not protect the templates above BIO pages. The issue is not that I need to sit around and wait for Arthur Rubin to make a response 2 weeks later or else I am edit warring, the issue why someone's BIO page should be allowed to be vandalized with a template whose issues they refute. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 01:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is that the edit warring is completely unacceptable behavior and leads to nothing positive. Surely you can see this from your own editing; your reverts are being undone at every pass. You can disagree with someone, even vociferously. That does not give you leave to engage in edit warring in an attempt to have your way. A number of people disagree with your stance. What you are opposing is <i>not</i> vandalism, but a different point of view than your own. That's what consensus building is for; to work through problems such as this (and this is far, far from being the first time editors have disagreed on something). You must engage in these processes. If you do not agree with the consensus arises from those processes, you do not have live to attempt to force Wikipedia towards your own point of view. If you feel the consensus building efforts are fruitless and/or result in poor decisions, you can then take the matter up via a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">request for mediation</a>, since I believe there's already been attempts via an RfC. If that still does result in a positive outcome for the betterment of the project, then a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">arbitration request</a> can be filed. That is how our <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a> processes work here. Relentless point of view warring is most definitely NOT the way to resolve this as doing so will resolve nothing. If you need assistance stepping through the dispute resolution process, I am happy to help. However, my warning stands; continued edit warring over this will result in a block. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 02:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
