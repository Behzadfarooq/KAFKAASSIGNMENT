	    <p>I prefer to read interleaved conversations rather than the usual back-and-forth between user talk pages. If I leave a message on your talk page, I may also leave a copy of my comment here, and encourage you (a little selfishly) to discuss the issue on this page. If I don't do this, I invite you to copy my comment here before replying to it. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 02:13, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess that I'll be the one with the dorky "Wikipedia Meetup" sign. ☺ My preferred spot (weather and crowds permitting) at Mozart's is outside, on the lower deck at the far left (from the bar, walk towards the lake, and go down the stairs). It's a little hard to find, but you tend to get space and privacy.

<p>Hi there! I noticed you recently added your votes to this page. I'd like to point out that the poll in question was closed a long time ago (as stated at the top) so adding new votes is not really useful at this point. If there is going to be a new poll about this, it will be prominently displayed at the village pump. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:17, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your note. At the point when I "voted", the page had no such statement at the top, nor did it indicate any expiry time. Indeed there is still no 100% explicit statement that it is "closed". I did think it odd that the poll should be held open for so long, but I wanted to register my opinion after GRuder attempted to list <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvinside_Academy_4754.html" title="Kelvinside Academy">Kelvinside Academy</a> for deletion.

<p>In November 2003, there was a VfD debate over <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_6fd2.html" title="Sunset High School (Portland)">Sunset High School (Portland)</a>.

<p>I am writing to you because you have participated in such debates before. There still does not exist a wikipedia policy (as far as i can tell) over what to do in regards to articles about specific U.S. public school. My hope is that a real consensus can come out of the debate, and a real policy can take shape.

<p>Hello Canaduh. Can you explain your rationale for adding Dr. Seuss to Category: German people? Maybe I'm taking the European perspective on nationality, but his article says he was born in America, and doesn't suggest that he sought German citizenship. He may have been entitled to the latter because of his mother. Are you claiming that he had dual citizenship? Or is your perspective that his ancestry makes him "German-American" and hence "German"? Thanks. Bovlb 02:07, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added him to the German people category because he is ethnically German, in America (meaning Canada and the States) people generally have an ethnicity and a nationality (ex. Italian-American, Irish-American). Thats why I added him to the "German people" category.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I changed it to German-American now</dd>

<p>Sorry, there was a mistake from my part; I used the wrong template message to make that edit. I would encourage you to read the new version of <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> - written by me and the guys over at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a> - so that you can understand the issue fully. Today we have managed to eliminate all generic stubs, there are about 10 of those left out of the original dozens of thousand articles, and your article was on that list of <i>articles which remained</i>, so I removed the generic stub tag from it. What the message was supposed to say was "Please only use the stub tag once the article has been transefered to the main Wikipedia namespace". if you have any doubts, feel free to contact me once more.

<p>Looking at that website, I can't see any explicit copyright notice or other licence, which means that <i>by default</i> we must assume it is copyrighted. Wikipedia's content is released under the GFDL, and we cannot in general just take information wholesale from other websites. The facts contained cannot be copyrighted, however, so we may read other websites and paraphrase the information. See <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html#Using_copyrighted_work_from_others" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights#Using copyrighted work from others</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_FAQ_f2da.html#Copyrights" title="Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ">Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ#Copyrights</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Regarding the images, it's possible that the other website is using out of copyright images which we may use. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_FAQ_f2da.html#I_have_an_out-of-copyright_image_.28or_text.29_that_is_reproduced_in_an_in-copyright_book._Can_I_scan.2Ftype_it_into_Wikipedia.3F" title="Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ">Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ#I have an out-of-copyright image (or text) that is reproduced in an in-copyright book. Can I scan/type it into Wikipedia?</a>.</p>
<p>On the positive side, so far as I can tell, the people running this site seem to be a small, friendly group that is interested in spreading historical information about their town. They may be amenable to releasing their work under the GFDL, and may even be interested in becoming Wikipedia contributors. One point I note is that your English language skills are better that theirs, so they may be glad to see their work copyedited and improved, especially if you're able to assist them with the translation from Serbian (or whatever langauge that is). You might like to contact them. There's some advice on how to do that at <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_request_for_permission_3446.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission">Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to pick on your contributions like this. I'm sure it must seem like a big hassle, but we have to be careful about such things. <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>, but please let me know if you have any other questions. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 18:21, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I already wrote these two articles again. I founded another source with information about these two persons. Can we now remove the notice about copyright violation? But, what is with images? Can I use these two images in the articles, or I have to upload new ones? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Your rewrites look good, although we would be better to cite sources; there's nothing wrong with using the original website for that. The instructions given at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a> suggest that we need to wait seven days (or more) for an administrator to delete the original page, and move the temp version in. This is so that the copyright infringement is not visible in the article history.</p>
<p>About the images, I'm not sure. I find the guidance at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_FAQ_f2da.html#I_have_an_out-of-copyright_image_.28or_text.29_that_is_reproduced_in_an_in-copyright_book._Can_I_scan.2Ftype_it_into_Wikipedia.3F" title="Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ">Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ#I have an out-of-copyright image (or text) that is reproduced in an in-copyright book. Can I scan/type it into Wikipedia?</a> a little unclear. Clearly the images are old, but if the ones you uploaded are simply from the website, then maybe their scan of an out-of-copyright image is copyrightable.</p>

<p>Dear Bob,<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thanks for the suggestion that I put the <i>Chuck Anderson, Leader of Endeavor Academy</i> article on the Speedy Deletion list. I agree that the likelihood of anyone ever thinking to look for an article under that name is not very high.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Just to make sure that such a <i>Speedy Deletion</i> might not mess anything else up, I read the article on speedy deletions. One thing that I was not able to get out of the article was whether or not such a deletion could possibly interfere with the correct redirecting of some of the earlier article titles such as the title <i>Endeavor Academy</i> onto the current article title <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Buell_Anderson_2c75.html" title="Charles Buell Anderson">Charles Buell Anderson</a>. Comments on this?</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 18:36, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would have interfered with the redirects were it not for the fact that I went through and corrected them. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Charles_Buell_Anderson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Charles_Buell_Anderson" rel="nofollow">here</a> to see the redirect structure.

<p><i>I have left the following note on the talk pages of a few users who may have some useful insight into why our copyright policies are not as obvious as they could be.</i></p>
<p>Hi again. I have a follow-up question for you. A lot of people genuinely want to contribute to Wikipedia, but don't realize that our copyright policies forbid direct copying from other websites. I'd like to save everyone a lot of time and trouble by improving our communication in this respect. Do you have any suggestions for how this could be made more obvious? Thanks, <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 2005-07-06 15:26:52 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You didn't ask me, but here is my response anyway. One simple improvement is to make the warning more visible. I posted my suggestion a while ago at the bottom of <a href="../../../c/o/p/MediaWiki_talk%7ECopyrightwarning_6cd9.html#Proposed_change" title="MediaWiki talk:Copyrightwarning">talk:Copyrightwarning</a>. Also (and here's where many people disagree), we need to have strict rules for copyvios <i>and</i> be strict about enforcing them – my experience shows that in many cases, copyvios won't be reverted if affected editors bitch and moan enough. As things are now, there's nothing to gain from meticulously checking contributions for copyvios, and nothing to lose from being negligent. That's no way to educate new editors. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 6 July 2005 15:58 (UTC)

<li>That's a plan, although I think "without permission" can mislead people into thinking that simple permission to use is enough. `And why not "public domain or GFDL"? Also, there should be a clear link to a fuller explanation. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 2005-07-06 16:30:17 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh, I didn't change <i>everything</i>. Most of what I did was simple reformatting and minor copyedit, the rest looks like the current notice. I would support some edits in the wording as well, but I thought it might be better to do it one step at a time. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 6 July 2005 16:43 (UTC)</li>

<p>You could probably communicate this better by asking the users to rephrase everything they include. I think people generally make a distinction between taking a paragraph from a different website, and a bullet pointed list for example. If it's clear that ANY material that is added has to be rephrased, people will most likely do it, and if they don't, it's best to flag the site for copyrighted material and let the user know what they have to change. - Modrac</p>

<p>Hi Bovlb,</p>
<p>Just wanted to respond to your comment regarding my request for a Speedy Deletion of the Crapsey article.</p>
<p>While I've made a number of contributions to Wikipedia, I'm a relative newbie when compared to many others. Frankly, I spent quite a bit of time composing and formatting the bio stub for Crapsey, which your collegeague "FreplySpang" hastily and incorrectly labeled a Copyvio. It was NOT -- as all of you should should know, there are only so many ways to summarize the salient points of anyone's life -- birth, childhood/family life, education, work, achievements, personal life, death, etc. Thus ANY bio blub will, by definition, have similarities to other blurbs on the same person one might find somewhere. The overzealousness of your colleagues has a chilling, stifling effect on those of us who want to make contributions to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I feel the Copyvio label tainted the credibility of my entry and, in effect, resulted in a waste of my time. I thus suggested that, if your colleagues felt they could do better then THEY should create their own Crapsey bio -- and I could monitor their work and comb through it for the "Copyvios" that would most assuredly be there.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you found my PLEASE STOP statement "curious", but it was frankly begining to feel like a Revert War, with your colleagues effectively teaming up and Sock Puppetting me, thereby avoiding the 3 Revert Rule!</p>
<p>Btw, what's the story with disabling Wikipedia Search for "traffic" reasons? Is this permanent!? Google and Yahoo do NOT deliver the same results as your own search tool. This developement effectively turns any Wikipedia search into a web search despite the "Search Wikipedia" option. Thanks.<br />

<li>Hi 4.156.234.84. Thanks for responding so calmly. I guess my remark on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a> may have been a little terse and cryptic. We have had problems in the past with people who post copyright violations, and then repeatedly remove the notice, often based on some non-consensus interpretation of copyright law. Being listed on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a> does not mean automatic deletion, but instead means that everyone can comment on the issue, and an administrator will look at it after a few days and take the appropriate action. I did not mean to imply that you definitely fitted that category, but I am generally suspicious of people who remove copyvio notices, as it implies something out-of-process is going on. It is normal practice in such cases to zealously restore the notice.</li>
<li>Regarding the actual issues of copyright violation in the article, I agree that there are only so many ways to phrase things, but there did seem to be a stronger-than-necessary resemblance. I did not form a strong opinion either way, but felt that there was sufficient cause to keep the question open to wider review on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>.</li>
<li>Regarding search, it is normal practice for the search to be disabled when the servers are under heavy load. I believe this is done automatically, and it is usually re-enabled shortly. It is possible that something is broken with the way we tell Google and Yahoo to restrict the search to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 18:22:24, 2005-07-12 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Bovlb, I'm frankly disturbed by your message regarding "undoing other people's edits without discussing them first. This is considered impolite and unproductive."</p>
<p>I'm not sure which article you're referring to, but you did not "discuss" my article with me when you edited it.</p>
<p>I was also distressed by your remark about being somewhat unsure of my Crapsey article, feeling it more a "sentence by sentence paraphrase" from EB rather than an article written "from scratch" and your statement (above) about a "stronger than ncessary" resemblance.</p>
<p>What does any of that mean in the real world?! "Stronger than necessary"! As writers, we research our subject and fashion the results into something, but this sort of writing NEVER produces something "new" or "original". I fear that many of you at Wikipedia have gotten bogged down in the sort of nitpicking which sees plagiarism everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of the 3 Revert Rule and cited it to you, having felt your collegues were Sock Puppeting me to insure I couldn't restore my postings. If anyone has been "impolite", it's them. 06:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi 4.157.77.100. The message I left on your talk page is the <a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3RR_aefa.html" title="Template:3RR">3RR template</a>, a standard template used to help users avoid stepping over the line. I apologize if its phrasing seemed inappropriate to this case; perhaps there was a more appropriate template I should have used. The article in question is <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, where you have four times removed other users' contributions in the last two hours.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia articles are not owned by anyone</a>, so I'm not sure what you mean by "my article".</dd>
<dd>As I said before, the level of similarily between your Crapsey article and the EB one disturbs me; it seems to me to be on the borderline of copyright violation. This is the reason why I feel it is important to keep it listed at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>, so that others can review the case. I realise this may seem like nitpicking, but I hope you understand that we have to be a little paranoid about copyright issues (<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Avoid_Copyright_Paranoia" class="extiw" title="m:Avoid_Copyright_Paranoia">but not too much</a>). For example, I would estimate that EB are pretty high on the list of people likely to sue Wikipedia for copyright infringement. My advice to you would be to find multiple sources for Crapsey's biographical details and synthesize a new article from all of them; I find this the best way to avoid the trap of simply mirroring the structure of someone else's work.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what the "Sock Puppeting" is, but I suspect that you're referring to the replacement of {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} tags that you removed. This is normal practice; any editor who sees a copyvio tag removed is likely to replace it, and then keep an eye on things.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry if you've found your experience with editing Wikipedia to be disheartening. Please do persevere. You should consider <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_create_an_account__49b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Why create an account?">creating an account</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 07:07:53, 2005-07-13 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi again Bov,</p>
<p>Not much time at the moment since I'm in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points.</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users -- from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the "process" of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend <i><b>my</b></i> position/claims.</p>
<p>1. I sometimes find a "You have a message waiting" notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage <i>directly</i> to you so it won't be visible to the world -- e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here?</p>
<p>2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is <i>quite</i> different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB.</p>
<p>Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica -- I don't know how you folks access EB Online, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides "teaser" articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:<br />
<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441</a></p>
<p>We have never been EB "trial" members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?</p>
<p>3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use "dummy" accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War.</p>
<p>In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Heyen_8cd4.html" title="William Heyen">William Heyen</a> -- they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, "Oh yeah? Well, <i><b>prove</b></i> it!""</p>
<p>I have no idea what sort of "proof" one can offer for <i>owning</i> someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might "prove it." If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.</p>
<p>4. As for "my article," I was referring to the fact that it's <i>mine</i> by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines <i>specifically</i> state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>the author of each edit</i> is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author <i>can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article</i>. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I seriously doubt it since they wouldn't have access to the posting info you and your colleagues use to monitor the database. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings -- especially if they checking for the sort of "similarities" you folks spend time on.</p>
<p>6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I <i><b>do</b></i> have accounts and would, indeed, like "credit" for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment. Sure we could create accounts to take any flack, but why bother?</p>
<p>7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why forms can be so dangerous.</p>
<p>8. Speaking of "templates", where does one find a complete list of "comment codes" such as {Copyvio}, {db}, etc. I've found pages that need revision but which I think need something more precise than the catchall {Cleanup}.</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.241.37.140.html" title="User:64.241.37.140">64.241.37.140</a>. I appreciate your taking the time to communicate.
<ul>
<li>The process of copyvio review takes place by people placing comments either on the Wikipeda:Copyright problems page or on the article's talk page. I favour the former. The admin taking final action (after about a week) should check both. I note that it's actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment. The ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page, and get considered for longer.</li>
<li>I feel that I should clear up one other point. You seem to be drawing a firm line between me and my "editorial colleagues", and yourself. We are all editors, including you, and WIkipedia is the result of our community efforts. Some editors are also admins, and have access to certain additional facilities, but other than that, they are not supposed to have particular control over content.

<li>Re 1. The new messages notice appears if someone has modified your user talk page since you last viewed it. I get the same message when you leave me a note. Unfortunately, because you're not logged in, I can only leave a message for your IP address and hope that it doesn't change the next time you visist. This is one good reason to log in. I will often copy messages I write onto my own talk page to make them easier to find. If you're looking at a user page or user talk page, you should see a link at the left under "Toolbox" labelled "E-mail this user". For users who have supplied an address (like me), this allows for private communication. (I'm not sure whether this works when you aren't logged in.) I do, however, prefer open communication on my user talk page if it's at all possible.</li>
<li>Re 2. The EB page I'm referring to is <a href="http://search.eb.com/women/articles/Crapsey_Adelaide.html" class="external text" title="http://search.eb.com/women/articles/Crapsey_Adelaide.html" rel="nofollow">the one originally referenced</a>. I hope you'll see why I see some similarity. I imagine that some Wikipedians have a subscription, but I do not.</li>
<li>Re 3. I covered the practice of restoring copyvio notices above, and I haven't done enough research to comment more specifically. It was rude of people not to respond to your question about how to prove ownership. I can't offhand find a page that documents the answer, but the usual two options are either to send a mail from the same domain as the website to a trusted Wikipedian (say an admin), or to place a notice on the website. In both cases, it's important that the message explicitly releases the text under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> (or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>). Wikipedia does not, in general, use text "with permission". This is important because there are others who reuse Wikipedia content under the GFDL. By the way, you would be amazed at some of the bold but unfounded claims past contributors have made about copyright ownership. It is to protect ourselves, and the rights of copyright owners, that we try to be so careful, and not take things at face value.</li>
<li>Re 4. You are quite correct. I apologise if my remark was snide.</li>
<li>Re 5. I do not have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use. I seem to have developed a "nose" for likely copyright violations. (Note that I did not, I think, make the initial identification for any of your articles.)</li>
<li>Re 6. I understand your position. My position is to use my account, and guard its reputation.</li>
<li>Re 7 and 8. See <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a>. This is not complete, but it is most of the useful ones.</li>

<p>Hi Bov,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your kind reply. Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection.</p>
<p>I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.</p>
<p>1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and "your editorial colleagues", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same "additional facilities" (which I take to mean "tools") as you, so I don't have the same <i><b>control</b></i>.</p>
<p>Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did -- I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.</p>
<p>2. Also regarding "tools" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.</p>
<p>There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the "teaser" entry for Crapsey.</p>
<p>Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: "we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!"</p>
<p>3. Regarding your statement that it's "actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment," are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the "offending contributor" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding -- I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.</p>
<p>Have no idea what you mean by "the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page." Can you point me to a sample of this?</p>
<p>4. Regarding your statement that "he EB page I'm referring to is <a href="http://search.eb.com/women/articles/Crapsey_Adelaide.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.eb.com/women/articles/Crapsey_Adelaide.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the one originally referenced -- what do you mean? Referenced <i>by whom</i>? By your colleague?</p>
<p>Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that <i><b>VERY</b></i> disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware &amp; Spybot S&amp;D just to see if anything they regard as "malicious" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it!&#160;;-)</p>
<p>5. On your reply to 3 above that "Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' " I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL "<i>license</i>," which, from my understanding of the law, means "with permission." The author still "owns" the material and, presumably can make whatever <i>other</i> use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.</p>
<p>6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you "don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use," this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other "watchers" like you (still don't know what your title is) know "what's new" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual <i><b>public list</b> of all new articles</i>? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?</p>
<p>Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow.</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.241.37.140.html" title="User:64.241.37.140">64.241.37.140</a>,
<ul>
<li>Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities. I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator. Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges. The procedure for doing this is described on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations. The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> page, nowhere else. Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.</li>
<li>Re 3: If you scroll down <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster. Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window. There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies. Have a look at some of the listed items for examples. Most entries on the <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> page are in dated sections under "New listings", but some have "fallen off the top" into "Older than 7 days".</li>
<li>Re 4: If you look at the original report on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html#July_11" title="WP:CP">WP:CP#July 11</a>, you'll see that <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuk_3ef6.html" title="User:Duk">Duk</a> listed that URL. Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice. How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware. 8-) It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure. I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.</li>
<li>Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify. People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like "in Wikipedia", "for non-commercial purposes", "providing it is quoted without alteration", or "on condition that the source is credited in a particular way". Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.</li>
<li>Re 6: New articles can be seen at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>. Changes to all articles can be seen at <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Special:Recentchanges</a>. Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.</li>
<li>I note with regret that <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> has just blocked you for 24 hours. In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit. Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project. 8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the "E-mail this user" link. I'll add a note to both entries on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> that we are in a dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion. This is independent of my feelings about the block itself. Sorry.</li>

<p>Yeah, I've been watching it. It looks pretty good. Some minor points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's normal to put the "See also" at the end.</li>
<li>You have no categories (see <a href="../../../b/r/o/Wikipedia%7EBrowse_267f.html" title="Wikipedia:Browse">Wikipedia:Browse</a>).</li>
<li>You should link up the years in dates. That way users get them formatted according to their date preferences.

<li>It would be nice to find some links to other language Wikipedias, if any have such an article.</li>

<dd>Thanks for your note. I guess I must have missed that one. My edit summary (<i>{{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-context_6558.html" title="Template:Cleanup-context">cleanup-context</a>}} DuneMUSH?)</i>) was just my guess about what the missing context was, not an indication of where the text itself might have come from. This must have been based on a Google search as I don't really know what DuneMUSH means, but I evidently didn't stumble on the right document to match it exactly. I'm usually pretty good at tracking down copyvios. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 03:46:06, 2005-07-19 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the source of that text. In the future, I will be more careful before posting material whose origins I didn't even bother to check.</p>
<p>Regarding the image, there's a note down the bottom of <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect4/lect4imgs.html" class="external free" title="http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect4/lect4imgs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect4/lect4imgs.html</a> (from whence the image is linked), and it states</p>
<p><i>Note: All images used on Classics Department pages accessed from this site are subject to copyright regulations, and are provided for non-commercial, study purposes only.</i></p>
<p>Being a Wiki newbie, (and a copyright newbie!), does this notice preclude the use of the image on Wikipedia? Probably...</p>

<p>Can we remove this entry from WP:CP? It seems to be done with, the anon who you were discussing seems to have left, and in it's history there doesn't seem to be any copyvio template, so can we get rid of it from WP:CP? BTW, I commend you for your patience in the discussion above. The anon was embarrassingly confused...

<dd>Sorry to be terse last night. The three specific points I noted were: using subst with {{<a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">vfd</a>}}; using {{<a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd2_353e.html" title="Template:Vfd2">vfd2</a>}} to start the actual vote page; and, most importantly, listing the vote on <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_26_95c1.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages for deletion/Log/2005 August 26">Wikipedia:Pages for deletion/Log/2005 August 26</a> using {{<a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd3_f7ce.html" title="Template:Vfd3">vfd3</a>}}.

<dd>I'm afraid that Fair Use images are getting less and less tolerance here as well, especially unsourced ones. If you did not create the image yourself, and you cannot find the original source, then I don't think there's anything you can tag it with that will save it. Sorry. I suggest you try finding a NASA source for this or a replacement image, as we can use them. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovlb_31b0.html" title="User:Bovlb">Bovlb</a> 22:34, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congratulations on being made an admin! I thought you might like to know of a javascript tool that may help in your editing by giving easy access to many admin features.

<p>Since joining Wikipedia I have learnt an awful lot, and one of those things is the value of teamwork. It has become increasingly apparent to me that there are absolutely tons of people out there devoted to editing the Scottish articles, but we communicate only haphazardly. To begin to attempt to remedy this, I have initiated a notice board for all Scoto-fans!</p>

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>).

Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion process</a>, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> or it can be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached.</p>
