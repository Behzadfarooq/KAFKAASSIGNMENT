<p>I was trying to reorganize the page to be a subpage of Massachusetts - I thought this would make for much easier navigation. The problem with using the link format [[Boston, Massachusetts]] is that it would seem to make all these independant pages instead of imposing a logical heirarchy. --DigitalSorceress</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, but I don't think that [[Massachusetts/Boston]] is easily linked to from other pages, nor is Boston always best considered in light of its place within Massachusetts (which is what its existence as a subpage seems to imply). I know this must sound like a hypocritical comment from someone who's spent most of his time here adding info on <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countries_of_the_world.html" title="Countries of the world">countries of the world</a>; I've recently come to believe that all those subpages are in fact a bad example for others and have every intention of moving them as soon as I decide what the best names are to move them to. But the usefulness of subpages is still fairly widely disputed, and I am interested in hearing further comments. &#160;:-) --<a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a></p>

<hr />
<p>Dan, yeah - I was in the process of repairing all the links that I was breaking that way when the Boston page got renamed to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> right under me - <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> has a scheme that he(?)s applying overall, so I sort of stopped and backed off ---DigitalSorceress</p>

<p>Boston in England? Never heard of it. Yes, it's probably a fairly major town. Maybe even a city.

<p>It may be the Commonwealth of Massachussetts, but its a state, not a commonwealth. A commonwealth of the United States is an overseas territory of the United States with a certain degree of autonomy, e.g. Puerto Rico. --- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the "rivalry" with New York</span></h2>
<p>I live near Boston (and went to college there in the sixties). I grew up near New York and my brother lives there.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing about the "rivalry" should be taken out. It's cutesy-poo but it's a point of view and, IMHO, it's probably inaccurate.</p>
<p>I certainly agree with the "one-sided" characterization. But it goes beyond that: I don't believe <i>New Yorkers</i> are aware of any rivalry with Boston (despite the parallel assertion in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York, New York</a> article).</p>
<p>Even if one could demonstrate that a rivalry exists, how could anyone document the statement that the rivalry "is considered to be the most infamous in the United States?"</p>
<p>It's likely that there was once such a rivalry, as the two cities were near each other and were both important ports, financial centers, and centers of "society." It's probably been a century since there was any real rivalry, other than possibly in baseball.</p>
<p>Boston's importance as (one of the cities that has claimed to be the) "Athens of America" is fading. Broadway shows no longer try out here. We get them on tour just as Phoenix and Milwaukee and San Jose.</p>
<p>The alleged rivalry with New York may be a reference to society, and the relative ranking of the New York families that summered in Newport and the Boston families that summered in Bar Harbor. I'm afraid I don't move in those circles. (I once knew someone who was in the <i>Social Register</i>—I've actually seen a copy of the <i>Social Register</i> (and <i>Dilatory Domiciles</i>)—<i>is</i> there still a <i>Social Register?</i>—so I don't know whether such a rivalry still exists, but I think it belongs to the days of the of John P. Marquand novels.</p>
<p>Within the last couple of decades, many of Boston's claims to a unique identity have been eroded. In several cases, Boston institutions have been acquired by New York. <i>Jordan Marsh</i>, our premier department store for over a century, is now Macy's. The <i>Boston Globe</i> is now owned by <i>The New York Times.</i> All of our regional banks have now been acquired by outside chains (but, at least, not by New York); the last big regional bank, Bank of Boston, was acquired by Fleet, which, in turn, has just been acquired by Bank of America.</p>
<p>My guess is that New York overtook Boston in the Gilded Age, that by the middle of the last century Boston's importance as a rival existed mostly in its own memories, and that today, to all intents and purposes Boston is just an average city (with nationally recognized universities, hospitals, and a first-rank symphony orchestry). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 13:11, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm from New York, and I disagree with this. Boston is New York's biggest rival in sports, definitely, and in high culture, academia, etc... Boston is an "average city," without claims to a unique identity -- are you serious? Like Lincoln, Nebraska, or wherever? Because out-of-town conglomerates acquired several banks and a department store? By that definition, New Orleans isn't unique. In my opinion, Boston's people and ambiance are distinctive.</li>

My guess is that the Macy's article is wrong, based on a common misconception. From haverhillusa.com: "Rowland Hussey Macy (1822-1919), of the New York City department store fame, got his start in the retail business by opening his dry goods store in downtown Haverhill in 1851. Macy's store was located on Merrimack Street. Macy's first parade was not in New York City as most may think, but was held in Haverhill on July 4, 1854. It was too hot that day and only about 100 people turned out to view the parade. Macy's policy for his store was "His goods are bought for cash, and will be sold for the same, at a small advance". In 1858 Macy sold his store and with the financial backing of Haverhill's Caleb Dustin Hunking, he left Haverhill to open a new store in New York City." AaronS 4 Jan 2005</li>

<p>-- This "rivalry" is really nothing more than a figment in the imagination of tabloid newspaper writers.

<li>As a native New Yorker, I do agree that the only rival city to NYC would be Boston. Both cities are large and have that old "urban grit" feeling to them, and I guess I would think of them as two brothers who always compete but understand that underneath they are mostly the same. What I mean to say is that if any city in the United States could one-up New York, it would have to be Boston.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that one of the best ways to rile up a Bostonian is to (as a New Yorker) feign indifference to their city and pretend that there is no rivaly. It worked for me while I was at Boston U!</p>

<dd>The word "modestly" is a bit of editorializing and perhaps doesn't belong there. As for the hub of the universe, I thought I had put it there some months ago, and I was surprised to find someone adding it. Yes, Boston is "the Hub" and in my opinion it belongs in the article; the lead section seems appropriate for a nickname as widely used as this one is. As I recall, there was a bronze plaque on the sidewalk in the downtown shopping district, proclaiming that that very spot was the Hub of the Universe! <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 10:58, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It definitely belongs in there, fairly conspicuously, as it is a very common nickname for the city. Not only in Boston but throughout the New England area, Boston is commonly referred to as "the Hub." It is a real nickname for the city, used un-self-consciously, unlike "Beantown." "Hub" is shorter than "Boston" and thus very convenient for and commonly used in newspaper headlines. An old joke about the provinciality of the Boston Globe says that if the Russians dropped an atomic bomb on New York, the Globe's headline would be "Hub man killed in New York blast." I grew up in a suburb of New York and was aware of "Hub" as a nickname for Boston long before I was aware that the full reference was "Hub of the universe." "Hub" is to "Boston" as "Philly" is to "Philadelphia." "Beantown" is to "Boston" as "The Big Apple" is to "New York."

<p>What was boston like in the 1800s what did they do for entertainment?</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether Oliver Wendell Holmes ever made a reference to beantown in such grandiose or (MORE LIKELY) sarcaastic terms, but the modern nickname comes from simple geography: When 'The FIRST EVER' circumferential highway was constructed (Mass Rt.128/I-95 of which no mention is made... known as "Whose folly?"... if you don't know the answer, you shouldn't be writing this piece!) in the late forties or early fifties any sufficiently small scale road map demonstrates forcefully this origination: "The Hub" is of A WAGON WHEEL.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification about the Big Dig</span></h2>
<p><i>"...as it removes enormous elevated highway structures and makes large areas of prime city land available for public development."</i></p>
<p>I haven't done the research on this yet, but I remember reading the paper in Boston that the land freed up by the Big Dig was useless for development, because the land above the tunnels would support very little additional weight. Does anybody else know about this? Or should I do the footwork and revision?</p>
<hr />
<p>Two answers follow:</p>
<p>1) Any building in Boston needs to put roots down below sea level into bedrock. This is generally accomplished by sinking columns rather than excavating foundation-wide pits. Through the whole area MBTA and private Train tunnels generally parrallel the highway, crossing one above the other, over top of the several highway(s)of BIG Dig Notoriety. Train tunnels require a lot of space to change depth for track grades (hill slope) must be kept quite small by automobile standards; though subway trains can tolerate much steeper slopes than general railroad locomotion... it still takes a lot of space to change elevation any significant amount so one tunnel can cross another.</p>
<p>For example, in and around the vicinity of 'Downtown Crossing', 'State Street', and 'Government Center' MBTA stations in no less than two seperate places two Tee lines both cross above the highway, which itself passes above yet a third MBTA tunnel, IIRC. (Orange, Red, and Blue Lines in one place, Orange, Red, AND Green in the other, iirc). To add insult to injury, various highway ramps and MBTA service tunnels take up additional 'corridor' space, as does the commercial rail roads entering the city into both South Station and North Station. Thus your query is sort of backwards. It's not a question of weight support so much as whether there is room so one can sneak enough weight support past existing structures-- like tunnels. THAT in turn would depend on the design footprint and exactly where in the spagetti tangle of tunnels one tried. fabartus@comcast.net</p>
<p>- 2) It's a moot point in any case... Actually the land freed up by the big dig is to become one huge park (or A series of parks, walks, pools, et al) by consent decree (verify with Sec'y of States Office) (OR POSSIBLY COURT ORDER) thanks to the environmental lobby(s) originally fighting the project during the Mayor White and Gov. S. DuTaxUs administration... both typical Mass. liberals. So instead of twice the highway, we've spent more than twice the money.</p>
<p>That is the space not taken up by ventilation and-or pump buildings is to be 'green' ... instead of sensibly kept as original transportation network (or bettered by limiting access Strategically so it evolved and would be a 'real Highway', not just 4-6 lanes of bumper-to-bumper parkinging lot), been kept would have just barely doubled traffic capacity by adding the tunnels and new roads of the big dig. Instead we've spent 15 Billion for no significant commute or through city added capacity, adding only airport (Third Harbor Tunnel) access improvements.</p>
<p>Instead, the BIG BOONDOGALE is the result... the airport can be reached EASIER, some conjestion has eased, but mostly, most traffic still has the same four lanes to park in through most of any given day -- oh, yeah, nothing at all to alleviate traffic growth was considerede in the original planning -- it still hasn't been addressed. fabartus@comcast.net</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commonwealth</span></h2>
<p>I've restored Commonwealth to the name of Massachusetts. I was born and bred in Boston, and still live in the Commonwealth. I have not seen any state document that does not refer to the state by its full name, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We also often use the term "The Commonwealth" to refer to Massachusetts. Since it's the official name and how we refer to the state, I don't see what the problem is with using it in this article. -Tomás</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Tomás -- I'm not originally from Boston, but I've lived here for 18 years. I changed it because while all you say is true about how it's used, I think that it is somewhat confusing to folks who aren't from Mass. (or Virginia, Penna., or Ky.) To have it placed so prominently makes it seem like there is some significance to having it in the first sentence of a <i>very</i> long article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, I know <i>we</i> say "the Commonwealth" all the time, but it's actually a rather unique usage for the very reason that it is a different title from most other states. In Michigan (where I'm from) people never use the phrase "the State" in that way. On the other hand, when I lived in Washington, D.C., people use the term "the District" in exactly the same way. It has some connotation of an entity that's different that just a geographical place -- and I think it's somewhat similar to the way that people from New York and San Francisco both say "the City".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, all of this is to say that using the term "Commonwealth" is very common and normal here, but Wikipedia is for people all over the world, and the place to emphasize and explain the term is in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, not <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>.

<p>Sorry if you thought my answer was flip. Didn't mean it to be that way. &#160;:) It's one of the problems with writing that it doesn't convey all the nuances of speaking.</p>
<p>I don't believe that the people of Rhode Island use the term "The Plantation" in refering to their state. I don't hear their politicians refering to "The Plantation" or the press using that name.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_U.S._States_0914.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. States">Wikipedia: WikiProject U.S. States</a> reads that "Each U.S. state shall be called by the common name of the state,...". We in Massachusetts do use the name "The Commonwealth" as a common name to refer to our state. The governor gives the State of the <i>Commonwealth</i> speach. The Legislature is the "General Court of the <i>Commonwealth</i>. <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/legis.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mass.gov/legis/legis.htm" rel="nofollow">General Court</a>. It is common usage, as well as the offical name of the state. The name is part of both state and American history <a href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf1a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf1a.htm" rel="nofollow">Massachusetts symbols</a>.</p>
<p>To remove Commonwealth from the name of Massachusetts makes no more sense to me that calling New Hampshire or New Mexico by the names Hampshire or Mexico because "New" is just an adjective.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I respectfully disagree. I think that the correct analogy is, "To remove Commonwealth from the phrase 'Commonwealth of Massachusetts' makes no more sense [to me] than referring to the State of New Hampshire or State of New Mexico by the names New Hampshire or New Mexico because 'State' is not part of the actual name." -- If someone can demonstrate the the phrase "the Commonwealth of Massachusetts" is equivalent to "Maine", rather than the phrase "the State of Maine" I will be happy to drop the subject.

<p>68.239.10.72's edit claiming that the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy is the oldest institution of higher education in Boston is supported by the college's own claims. MCP’s website states that the college was "founded" in 1823 (<a href="http://www.mcphs.edu/MCPHSWeb/about/about.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mcphs.edu/MCPHSWeb/about/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcphs.edu/MCPHSWeb/about/about.html</a>). However this claim is flawed: Dec 8, 1823 represents the date on which the Boston apothecaries first met to organize their guild. Their reason for meeting was not to specifically to found the college. The college officers were only organized in 1830, and their charter granted in 1852. More importantly, MCP's first lectures were only held in 1867 and its first actual class graduated in 1869. Given that Boston College was holding classes as early as 1827 (albeit without a charter from the Commonwealth), this would still make BC the first institution of higher education established in the city of Boston.140.247.125.10 23:19, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From (www.mcphs.edu): "MCPHS is the largest college of pharmacy in the United States. MCPHS was founded in 1823- the second oldest college of pharmacy in the United States and the oldest <b>institution of higher education in the City of Boston</b>-, and is located in the heart of the Longwood Academic and Medical area of Boston." Another source from (<a href="http://www.thehighschoolgraduate.com/editorial/BO/MACollege.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.thehighschoolgraduate.com/editorial/BO/MACollege.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehighschoolgraduate.com/editorial/BO/MACollege.htm</a>)&#160;: "<b>Founded in 1823</b>, MCPHS is the second oldest pharmacy school in the U.S. and the <b>oldest college in the city of Boston</b>. In response to change, MCPHS expanded its mission over time to include a number of science and healthcare programs. With its distinguished history and international reputation" It seem that MCPHS is, technically, the first institution of higher education in Boston. What reasons could MCPHS have to lie on its official site?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not lying per se, but PR-copy often involves tweaking the facts. Without the meeting of the Boston apothecaries in 1823, it is likely MCPHS would never have come into existence. By the same token, Boston College could point to the meeting of the first Jesuits in 1534 as the root of its existence. However, neither can be considered a founding date. For a detailed account of the history of MCPHS, see Ernest C. Marshall's Early History of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. 140.247.125.194 17:16, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BU has only been in its present location since the 1940's, but has been in the city since 1867. It is not a "relative newcomer to the city." The education portion of this article is heavily slanted towards BC, as the writer clearly went out of their way to downplay BU's presence in the city and emphasis on how much of Boston College is actually within the city limits now.</p>

<p>The "Oxford of America" quote should probably be immediately scrapped, since I don't think anyone besides the writer of the article has ever used such language, and even if the quote can be culled from some outside source, it has been made towards many other more prestigious university's for both academic and aesthetic reasons and looks almost silly in its current context.

BC's campus is historic precisely because it was the first comprehensive masterplan designed in the Collegiate Gothic style. The phrase "Oxford of America" isn't a subjective point of view, but was the phrase used to describe the BC campus in the <i>Boston Saturday Evening Transcript</i>, <i>The American Architect</i> and other US and British media outlets around the time the "new" campus opened. --18.95.1.29 05:08, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reworded it make it clear that "Oxford in America" referred to <i>architecture,</i> and that it was a 1907 name for an ambitious proposal (only partially realized). The BC website reference cited above makes it clear that the phrase "Oxford in America" referred to a plan for <i>twenty</i> buildings, not to the four that were actually built. While a reference to "Oxford in America" seems very appropriate for the article on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> it seems to me like unnecessary detail, for an article on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, particularly when (see below) <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simmons_College_60f3.html" title="Simmons College">Simmons</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheelock_College_7283.html" title="Wheelock College">Wheelock</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson_College_18e0.html" title="Emerson College">Emerson</a> don't get so much as a mention. Even so, I think the name "Oxford in America" is breathtakingly presumptuous. The "dreaming spires" of Oxford characterize the town in a way that the BC campus does not.

<p>Even though the article has now been edited to make it clear that the "Oxford" line is a arcetectural reference, it doesn't change the fact that the arcitecture shown is in the City of NEWTON, Massachusetts, and not Boston. It is my understanfing that the Boston/Newton line within the Chestnut Hill neighborhood cuts through Alumni Stadium and Conte Forum. Anything higher on the hill is not relevant to the article. I'm sure far fewer people would have an issue if you moved the dubious and self-aggrandizing statement to the page reserved for NEWTON.</p>

<p>In an article about Boston, this section should include only brief descriptions of the city's main institutions with links to their individual articles and the general list of Boston-area schools. What is pertinent here is not each school's institutional history but its relationship to the city. BU's former religious affiliations and incarnations are not as relevant to a Boston article as the fact that the school is a relative newcomer to the city, having established its present campus only in the 1940s, and the fact that it is now one of Boston's largest employers. Statements such as "Boston University is now recognized internationally as a leading institution of learning and research" clearly do not present a NPOV. Likewise, the details of BC's real estate dealings are best left to the BC article. 140.247.125.139 17:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd propose as a qualification for inclusion that the name of the city in the institution's main mailing address be "Boston."

<p>This criterion strikes me as problemmatic for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mailing addresses within Boston ZIP codes, often substitute "Boston" with local nomenclature. For example, a postcard to Boston, MA 02129 can just as well be sent to Charlestown, MA 02129 <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The same holds true for places like "Brighton," <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> "Dorchester," <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> "Roxbury," <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> etc. Simply because a mailing address names its neighborhood instead of "Boston" doesn't make it any more or less a part of the city.</li>
<li>"Chestnut Hill" is not a town, but the name of a neighborhood that covers parts of Boston, Brookline and Newton. For example, this condo development <a href="http://www.liveatthewaterworks.com/c_sales_center.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.liveatthewaterworks.com/c_sales_center.php" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> is entirely within Boston, but uses "Chestnut Hill" in its mailing address.</li>
<li>While Larry Summers' office may well be in Massachusetts Hall in Cambridge, Harvard University does not have a singular mailing address. Many of its principal addresses are in Boston <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/siteguide/faqs/faq12.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harvard.edu/siteguide/faqs/faq12.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. --18.95.1.29 05:42, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just stating that I think there are problems with this criterion.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Harvard Medical School is in Boston and might well deserve mention. But Harvard is in Cambridge. Period, end of story. It would be absurd to say that MIT is in Dedham, Massachusetts despite owning property there.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>MIT's Endicott House in Dedham is a conference and retreat center not an academic campus, so I don't think this is a fair comparaison. In addition to the Medical School, Harvard's Business School, Dental School and School of Public Health are all located entirely in Boston--as is Harvard Stadium and the Soldiers Field Athletics Area (i.e. all Harvard "home games" are held in Boston).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>People who live in Chestnut Hill do not describe themselves as living "in Boston." Ditto Roslindale, West Roxbury, etc. The Boston mailing address is a convenient and neutral way to narrow down the list of "Boston" colleges and universities, and it is one that accords with how locals think of "Boston" (as opposed to "Boston-area."). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 09:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that this criterion is often ambiguous and arbitrary in many cases, leaving much room for debate. The flip side of the coin: Boston Baptist College <a href="http://www.boston.edu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.edu" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> is located in Hyde Park, though it chooses to use "Boston" in its mailing address. --18.95.1.29 08:34, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Please, editors, refrain from over-'summarizing' Boston's history. The current article, as of 11:24 CT on October 16, is very well-done, and gives readers a real sense of Boston's history. In recent months, the section has been poorly-written--an excessively brief hodge-podge of facts. Let us keep the most recent changes. They add narrative, depth, and color.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sub-Sections and Neighborhoods</span></h2>
<p>Someone added the following to the article, which is also mentioned in the demographics section. However, I am thinking of creating a sub-article on Boston's neighborhoods and have such information moved there. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 03:20, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boston proper is subdivided into a few major sections with smaller neighborhoods contained within them. The Back Bay, Beacon Hill, and the South End form the downtown residential neighborhoods. The residents of these three neighborhoods are usually very wealthy, with the South End being the least wealthy of the three. To the east of these three neighborhoods is Downtown Boston, where the financial district, government structures, and the city's Chinatown are located. The North End of Boston and its neighbor, East Boston, form the Italitan section of the city. On the north bank of the Charles River is Charlestown, a predominately Irish enclave.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>South of downtown Boston and the rich neighborhoods are the sections of the city that some residents consider "the real Boston." Dorchester, Roxbury, South Boston, and Jamaica Plain are much more socially and economically diverse than their counterparts to the north and contain block upon block of New England style "Triple-Decker" housing. Roxbury and Dorchester are usually percieved as the most dangerous neighborhoods of Boston, however both are becoming increasingly gentrified. Other sections of the city proper include Allston-Brighton, Mattapan, Roslindale, West Roxbury, and Hyde Park.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Boston is both blessed and cursed by its small geographic size. Unlike other east coast cities like New York and Philadelphia, Boston former streetcar suburbs lie largely outside of its city limits. Independant cities like Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville, and Chelsea are very urban and possess characteristics similar to Boston's, yet are seperated politically from the city. Boston's small size makes it walkable and manageable, but its lack of land area gives a population figure disillusion of its actual size.</dd>

<p>Well, the spelling and grammar are atrocious, so whatever happens to this text, it needs a good copyedit. I think the best way to approach this topic is actually in an article about the territorial expansion of the city, including both land-making (North End, Back Bay, South End, Southie, Eastie) and annexation (Brighton, not Brookline, only half of Charlestown, Dorchester, part of Milton, Roxbury, West Rox). Particularly in the case of the annexations, it's vital to explain why these particular communities and not others, and in particular how much of a barrier the river was. There are several good reference works on the subject. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 04:29, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
