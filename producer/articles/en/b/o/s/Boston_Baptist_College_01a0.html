	    <p><b>Boston Baptist College</b> was founded in 1976 by Dr. A.V. Henderson (he served as the first President) and Dr. John Rawlings (then president of BBFI, [Baptist Bible Fellowship International]).</p>
<p>Its original name was Baptist Bible Institute East and this first campus was in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrub_Oak%2C_New_York_879e.html" title="Shrub Oak, New York">Shrub Oak, New York</a>. In 1981 the school moved to its present location in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of the move, the school was considered a branch campus of Baptist Bible College (in [Springfield, Missouri]).</p>
<p>In 1986, Dr. Harry Boyle was chosen to be the second president. Beginning in 1993, the school began operating as a separate entity within [Massachusetts], and ceased from being a branch campus of [Baptist Bible College - Springfield, Missouri].</p>
<p>Accreditation was sought and awarded in 1995, with bachelor degree granting abilities to follow in 2001. Another name was taken to reflect its location and to identify it with the higher education status of its location. Boston Baptist College is now the name under which the school operates.</p>
<p>In 2005, David Melton became the third president. He formerly served at the college in the capacity of Executive Vice President (2002-2005) and Academic Dean (1996-2002).</p>

<p>In a quiet residential neighborhood just seven miles from the heart of downtown Boston, Boston Baptist College flourishes as a distinctively biblical educational institution in the context of America's greatest university city. The five acre campus is just minutes away from world-renowned educational and cultural facilities, and yet is a quiet and attractive contrast to the rush of city life. The diverse natural beauty of New England's rocky Atlantic coastline, as well as the picturesque mountains just a short drive away, present an unparalleled location for ministry preparation.</p>
<p>Boston Baptist College has, for more than two decades, been equipping men and women for church ministry both in the United States and abroad. Under the leadership of Dr. A.V. Henderson, who served as the first President, and Dr. John Rawlings, then President of the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, Baptist Bible Institute East was established in Shrub Oak, New York in 1976. Out of a deep concern for the population centers along America's northeastern seaboard, churches and church leaders from across the country joined together to raise up a college that would emphasize the historic fundamentals of the Christian faith. Coupled with that doctrinal commitment was a resolute mindset to build a college that would recognize the biblically ordained role of the Scriptural church in God's redemptive plan. Soul-winning and Baptist church planting were at the very core of the founders' design. Within a year of its inception, the school was designated as an approved training facility by the Baptist Bible Fellowship International.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1981 all operations were moved to the present campus in Boston and the school name was changed to Baptist Bible College East. At that point the college was incorporated as a branch campus of Baptist Bible College, Springfield, Missouri, and continued under Dr. Henderson's leadership, with Dr. W.E. Dowell functioning as the chancellor of both campuses. A year later, Dr. Henderson assumed the presidency of the combined institution until 1986, when Dr. Harry Boyle of Portland, Maine, was chosen to be the second president of Baptist Bible College East. A new era of operations began in 1993 when the college was chartered separately within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and thus was no longer a branch campus of the Missouri school. The college was legally authorized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to offer the Associate in Science Degree in Biblical Studies in 1993. In 1995, Baptist Bible College East received accredited status with TRACS (Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools). Then in March, 2001, the Board of Higher Education approved authority to award the Bachelor of Biblical Studies Degree. The next year, the college legally changed its name to Boston Baptist College to reflect its strategic location in the world's greatest university location while retaining the college's historic mission to educate church leaders for a new millennium.</p>

<p>Life at Boston Baptist College offers students the best of many different worlds.</p>
<p>The college is located within the city limits of Boston, one of the world’s great cultural and intellectual centers. The city is easily accessible by air, train, and automobile, while public mass transit offers convenient transportation to most of the historic and cultural sights. This affords students, faculty members, and administrators unrivaled access to world-class museums, libraries, educational institutions, and artistic performances. Boston’s neighborhoods showcase a rich diversity of traditions from more than one hundred people groups, making a simple walk through the city extraordinarily educational. Blend with these opportunities the scenic beauty of New England’s mountains and Atlantic seacoast, and you have a context for college life that is simply unbeatable.</p>
<p>Since the college itself is a community of Christians committed to God and His Word, a context of mutual respect and compassion is at the core of life at Boston Baptist College. All members of the Boston Baptist College family affirm a personal relationship with Christ and participate actively in the life of area churches. The college family then benefits not only from the vitality of those churches, but is enriched by the privilege to serve the Lord amid the great spiritual needs of the Northeast. Christian character, integrity, and moral ethics are expected of all members of the college family at all times. Boston Baptist College is a substance and smoke free campus, as well as an institution that aggressively opposes violence, harassment, and all forms of dehumanization, including promiscuity.</p>
