<p>Alexandra Nagel was the author of an article <b>De Sai Paradox: Tegenstrijdigheden van en rondom Sathya Sai Baba/The Sai Paradox:contradictions of and surrounding Sathya Sai Baba</b> from the series <b>Religieuze bewegingen in Nederland/Religious movements in the Netherlands</b> nr. 29 <b>Sekten/Cults/Sects</b>, published by the Free University of Amsterdam, 1994, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9053833412</a>. The article was published in the Dutch only.</p>
<p>The Free University of Amsterdam advertises that its "origins are rooted in the Christian faith" and that "it still retains its tradition of Christian standards and values."</p>
<p>Since 1994 Nagel has written several other articles, <b>A guru accused</b> and <b>Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?</b>, in English which have not been published in reputable journals, but which are available on the internet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> reports that the articles <b>A guru accused</b> and <b>Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?</b> shares both similarities with and differences from her 1994 article. Among the differences, the 1994 article contains information specific to the Netherlands, not mentioned in the other articles, and 1994 article treated only allegations of inappropriate sexual approaches to Tal Brooke and Keith Ord while here later articles also report upon other allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>

<li>SSS108: No I do not believe the account is fair and factual. The two articles were <b>not</b> published in any reputable references. If the alleged updated versions (both written in 2001) were so notable and reputable, why have they not been published since? If non-notable articles can be cited, and we begin to allow this with Nagel, this will set a precedent that most certainly will be abused. Therefore, I do not accept any reference to Nagel's non-notable articles. If Nagel's non-notable articles are to be cited, then we must also make mention to Nagel's embarrassing diary notes that she publisehed on the internet and her email correspondence with me. Does Andries agree to this too? As stated on our earlier discussion, any editor can remove any information that is not reliable cited. You include it, I can rightfully remove it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BostonMA/Mediation#Understanding_the_Reliable_Sources_Policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BostonMA/Mediation#Understanding_the_Reliable_Sources_Policy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 17:23, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>SSS108, the account above states that the two articles were not published in reputable journals. Perhaps you misread. Also, I would like this section to deal exclusively with facts.

<dd>BostonMA. I understand that. Nevertheless, since when do we start making references to non-notable articles? As I already stated, if we make reference to Nagel's 2 non-notable articles, then we should also make mention to her non-notable diary notes (in which she uses expletives to describe SSB, divulges her emotional problems and contradicts the 2 articles in question) and her email correspondence with me. Therefore, what standard should we follow? If Nagel's non-notable works are to be cited, then we should cite all of them. I would like my original comment left in this section. If you want to start another section about non-notability, that's fine with me. And if you want to move these 2 posts, that is also fine with me. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 18:18, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>SSS108, I would like this section to represent a factual account. I would also like it to represent a factual account to which everyone agrees without any caveats or reservations. I have pointed out that some of your original comment is related to policy issues, and not to facts. May I remove them? Second, you made a statement that might be interpretted as you believing that the factual account is inaccurate. You state "The two articles were <b>not</b> published in any reputable references." I have pointed out that the account given above also states that the two articles were not published in any reputable journal. Thus I have difficulty understanding whether or not there are any alleged facts in the account that you believe are not facts, or whether there are any facts that you believe need to be present in order to avoid deception by selective presentation of the facts. Please address these two issues. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 19:05, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BostonMA, I guess you can remove/move whatever you see as irrelevant. Those two articles are specifically against SSB. Therefore, Nagel needs to called a Critic of SSB. Furthermore, on the <i>"Shiva Shakti"</i> article, there is only mention to one other alleged sexual abuse victim, <i>"Sam Young"</i> (which is a pseudonym). It is also my contention that <i>"A Guru Accused"</i> is NOT related to Nagels <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i>. That is separate article altogether. Nagel emailed me and ONLY said that the <i>"Shiva Shakti"</i> article encapsulated the contents in <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i> <a href="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/emails-alexandra-nagel2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/emails-alexandra-nagel2.html" rel="nofollow">Reference</a> I don't feel that referencing Nagel's Anti-Sai Articles, when they have not been notably referenced, is appropriate. The paragraph you wrote would be advocating for non-notable Anti-Sai Material (which Andries himself is dead against). Although the words are factual, it is not fair. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 22:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, the paragraph(s) at the beginning of this section do not advocate for non-notable Anti-Sai Material. They were intended to be merely a statement of some pertinent facts, and that is how they appear to me. Could you explain a bit why you believe that they advocate something and are unfair? It would help if you gave pick out one or two sentences which you feel are advocacy.

<dd>Well, I don't know how to much this much clearer to you, BostonMA. First of all, it is not like Nagel is some sort of reputed person who is well known for publishing material on SSB. She managed to get <b>one</b> paper published in 1994 in an Anti-Sect Journal published by a Protestant University. That's it! Andries vociferously demands that any people and references mentioned in the SSB articles be mentioned in <i>"reputable media or sources"</i>. Andries seeks the exclusion of my name from the SSB articles, yet the paragraph cites Andries name (when he is as "non-notable" as he claims I am). If Andries name it cited, he should also be referenced as a critic of SSB. Nowhere does the paragraph state Nagel is a self-professed critic of SSB since 1990. The Shiva Shakti and Guru Accused articles have not been published anywhere else <b>except</b> on Anti-Sai Sites, yet these articles are being referenced based on what? A 1994 article that Andries claims was updated? These are Anti-Sai Articles specific to Anti-Sai Sites. Let you or Andries show me otherwise. Specifically, I take issue with the mentioning of the names to the two articles and the absence of the fact that Nagel is a self-professed critic of SSB since 1990. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 02:03, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your resonse. I'm now suspecting that there is confusion regarding the purpose of the paragraphs that I wrote. I wrote these paragraphs (and others) because I hope that by <i>organizing</i> the discussion, we might be able to reduce some of the repetitiveness in the discussion. From your comments, I am suspecting you might believe that I would like the paragraphs above to become part of the SSB articles or you might believe that agreeing to the paragraphs above somehow prevents you from raising concerns and objections that you believe to be valid. Please let me know if I am getting close to understanding your point of view. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 02:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Yes, that is what it appeared we were doing, i.e., trying to write a paragraph that everyone could mutually agree on, to be included into the SSB article about Nagel. I just noticed that Andries wrote, on his first response, <i>"She also wrote one article in Dutch as part of her curriculum that has served as the basis for the three English language articles."</i> Here, Andries is flip-flopping about the origins to this article. Andries stated, several times, that the article was <b>not</b> written as a college assignment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Reference_Problems" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Reference_Problems" rel="nofollow">Scroll To Bottom Of Section</a>, and now he just said the article was written as part of Nagel's curriculum (meaning it was a college assignment). The "truth" changes every other week. That is why I cannot accept his claims or words at face value. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 03:44, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As usual you see deception where there is only a somewhat complicated situation and misunderstanding. (I do not understand why you do not show even a fraction of your skepticism for SSB's words too.) She wrote two Dutch articles for two universities, one was an official publication called <i>De Sai Paradox</i> for the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_University_of_Amsterdam_e0b0.html" title="Free University of Amsterdam">Free University of Amsterdam</a> in 1994 and one was written 2001 as as part of her curriculum and called <i>De Neergang van een Goeroe door het Internet - Sai Baba: van avatar naar homo-pedofiel/The Downfall of a guru through the Internet -Sai Baba: from avatar to homo-pedophile</i> for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Amsterdam_ff6b.html" title="University of Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a>. That article served as the basis for three English language articles. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Andries, where was the 2001 article published? You are changing tactics again. First you argued that "De Sai Paradox" is the original source for the other two articles: "A guru accused" and "Sai baba as Shiva-Shakti: a created myth? Or?" Now, you are saying that there are three English articles instead of two (which you originally claimed). It appears you are now saying that Alexandra Nagel's article "Sai Baba: from avatar to homo-pedophile" is the original source for the other 2/3 English articles. This contradicts your original claim that "De Sai Paradox" is the original source for the other 2/3 English articles. So which is the original source: "De Sai Paradox" or "Sai Baba: from avatar to homo-pedophile"? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 06:51, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>BostonMA, now you can see the problem here. The truth has finally come out. I will refer to the following articles as:</p>
<p><i>"De Sai Paradox"</i> = <b>Ref1</b></p>
<p><i>"Sai Baba - from avatar to homo-pedophile"</i> = <b>Ref2</b></p>
<p><i>"A Guru Accused"</i> = <b>A</b></p>
<p><i>"Shiva Shakti: A Created Myth? Or?" = <b>B</b></i></p>
<p><i>"For And Against Sathya Sai Baba On The Internet"</i> = <b>C</b></p>
<p>First, Andries insisted that <b>Ref1</b>, the Dutch article published in 1994, was the original source for the updated versions of articles <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> → Because of these claims BostonMA attempted to write a factual account using this information → Andries then mentioned article <b>C</b> and said it contained <i>"completely new information"</i> (meaning it is not dependent on <b>Ref1</b> or articles <b>A</b> or <b>B</b>) → Andries then made reference to <b>Ref2</b>, a Dutch article published in 2001, and claimed that articles <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> originated from it (meaning they did not originate from <b>Ref1</b> as Andries originally claimed) → After researching <b>Ref2</b>, it was written on January 29th 2001 → Articles <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> were written in August 2001 and article <b>B</b> was written in September 2001 <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articlesframe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articlesframe.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> → After reading <b>Ref2</b>, it is obvious that it is the original source for articles <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> (they contain essentially the same information) → So it can only be concluded that articles <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> were NOT the updated versions to <b>Ref1</b> as Andries originally contended. <b>Ref2</b> is the source. I assume Andries next tactic is to say that <b>Ref2</b> came from <b>Ref1</b>. However, it is clear that <b>Ref2</b> is a completely different article. For starters, <b>Ref2</b> makes no mention to Swallow (which comprised a huge chunk of <b>Ref1</b>) and relies heavily on internet sources (as can be seen in the references). Also, out of 85 references listed on <b>Ref1</b>, only 4 (Eijk, Djik, Brooke and Vroon) were cited on <b>Ref2</b> (yes, I checked all of them). Clearly, they are not the same article, nor was one taken from the other. So the "notably" published <b>Ref1</b> does NOT lend its "notability" to the Anti-Sai Articles <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> or <b>C</b> or <b>Ref2</b>. The story keeps changing. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 18:33, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thaumaturgic: The summary sounds factual to me, but it is not fair. I agree with SSS108. Citing non-notable references is setting a precedent that will be abused. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 18:30, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thaumaturgic, the account above does not make any mention of whether non-notable references ought to be, or ought not to be cited. It makes no references to Wikipedia at all. When I asked whether the parties agreed that it presented the facts fairly, what I was asking is whether the parties agree that the presentation has <b>not</b> omitted facts which would cast a different light on the subject.

<p>After reading the other's comments, I guess I am tempted to give my own views as well. Yes, please move my comments as you see fit. I believe the above account is not factual for two reasons: 1) As SSS108 pointed out, Alexandra Nagel's status as a Sai Antagonist is not mentioned; 2) Andries never argued, until recently, that "A guru accused" and "Sai baba as Shiva-Shakti: a created myth? Or?" were updated versions of "De Sai Paradox". I have noticed, over the past months, that Andries has changed his opinions and tactics repeatedly to suit his point of view. I consider Andries recent claims about "A guru accused" and "Sai baba as Shiva-Shakti: a created myth? Or?" to be more of the same. For these two reasons, I do not consider the account factual. I hope this answered your question. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 06:00, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, we must rely on Andries assessment of the situation, which I cannot accept. The published article <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i> is <b>only</b> written in Dutch and I don't read Dutch. How this one published article became two separate articles equal in length, if not more, is beyond me. The references for <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i> are hardly comparable, with the references used on <i>"Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?"</i> and <i>"A Guru Accused"</i>. Also, one does not notice any references to Sam Young, Helena Klitsie and other names. It seems the main part that is copied is about Deborah Swallow. However, Swallow does not talk about the allegations. Since these two articles have not been published in any reputable sources, they would constitute original research. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 05:13, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The question has arisen whether or not the articles <b>A guru accused</b> and <b>Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?</b> may be considered reliable sources. The Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> contains text which I believe bears upon the question:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A good way to look at the distinction between verifiability and truth is with the following example. Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false." Even though you have this from the author himself, you cannot include the fact that he said it in your Wikipedia entry.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the current situation, it may be a fact that Nagel's English articles report many of the same facts as her published article. However, it seems to the mediator that statements by Nagel are analogous to the famous physicists statements about his/her current (dis)belief in Theory X. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 03:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please indicate whether you agree or disagree that the above two articles do not satisfy the requirement of verifiable sources according to Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Please do not discuss other issues in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Andries: I believe that using the two updated English language articles by Nagel (There were three articles, but one contained completely new information) folllows the spirit of the Wikipedia policies of using the best sources available. Nevertheless, I admit that using these articles do not follow the letter of the policy. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An argument has been raised that articles which do not satisfy the requirements for verifiable sources according to the letter of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> policy, might nevertheless be a better source than an older article which does meet those requirements (according to the letter). A relevent passage from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability Policy</a> is again:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A good way to look at the distinction between verifiability and truth is with the following example. Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article.

</dl>
<p>The two newer articles differ from the older published article in that they contain more recent material. However, this seems to be analogous to the situation of the physicist with an updated theory. The physicist's new theory may in fact be an improvement from a scientific viewpoint. Nevertheless, from Wikipedia's perspective, the "better" source is the one that has been published. In the case of the Nagel articles, the differences that distinguish the two newer articles from the older published article might be seen as improvements because they are more up to date. However, I think Wikipedia's policy is to <i>not</i> necessarily use the most up-to-date information, but to use the most up-to-date information that has been deemed credible by an appropriate community of experts.</p>

<p>The question has been raised as to whether Wikipedia policy or guidelines require sources to be notable. The text of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Notability</a> begins with the statement:</p>

<dd>A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is the mediator's interpretation of the notability guideline, that it applies only to the question of which topics ought to be included in Wikipedia. The mediator does not read the notability requirement as saying that verifiable sources used to suppport various statements in a Wikipedia article need to be notable.

Of course I have avoided answering some other questions, such as whether the edits you may make would be considered appropriate for the article, and whether the journal(?) in which the article was published is reliable. So my suggestion is that you not do any translation, if this is at all difficult for you. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 04:22, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Alexandra Nagel's 1994 published article was based upon writings she had authored in partial fulfillment of her academic requirements. The question is raised whether such works may be considered reputable sources. Specifically, concern has been raised that the author did not have academic credentials at the time the article was written. In the mediator's opinion, it is the responsibility of a reputable publication to screen articles for their quality.

<p>Nagel's 1994 article was published by an institution which advertises that it adheres to a "tradition of Christian standards and values." It is not an unreasonable supposition that a certain rivalry exists between the Free University of Amsterdam and Sathya Sai Baba's movement. It is this mediator's opinion, that when relying upon publications of such an institution as the source of information in a Wikipedia article, the Wikipedia article needs to properly attribute this information. In my opinion, this requires a statement in the text of the article that the information is sourced by an institution that professes adherence to Christian values, or something similar.</p>

<li>Andries: No, this is exaggerated. It would have been different if Nagel worked as a professor for the VU on the dept. of theology, like Kranenborg, because, I guess, if you want to work there on that dept. one is probably selected on Christian background and one probably has the obligation not to write anti-Christian, but this is an article by a person who was never an employee of the VU. There is nothing that indicates that the selection of authors for indivual movements for this magazine is influenced by a requirement for a Christian background or pro Christian writings, or anti-non Christian writings. I cannot see anything anti-Hindu in Kranenborg's later writings, with the exception of one book by him that is published by a protestant Christian publishing house. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:17, 12 February 2006 (UTC) (amemded for content)</li>

<dd>That is the problem in quoting non-English sources. My view, is that the cite is needed as it was published in a publication that meets the threshold for reputable source, but I also strongly believe that attribution alone is not sufficient in this case, being a single article published by an Ortodox Protestan University. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:59, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>An analogy, in the article <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">guru</a>, I included a reference to a 1997 article by a university professor (Albertina Nugteren) of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universiteit_van_Tilburg_f331.html" title="Universiteit van Tilburg">University of Tilburg</a> that was then still officially (until 2002) a catholic university, but to state that she worked for a then Catholic university is possible, but I still think somewhat exaggerated. (I just became of aware of this fact by the way) And to state the very diluted religious background of the university in a publication of the university when treating an article by an author who never worked for the university is clearly exaggerated. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:12, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not about Nagel. It is about Nagel's article that was published in "Sekten", an Anti-Sect journal published by a Protestant University.

<dd>The information is correct, though I do no know whether it is a Journal. The tone and the contents of the various articles in that magazine is not anti-cult. Yes, sometimes it is critical, and sometimes very critical, but in almost all cases the criticism is justified.

<dd>The editors select suitable authors and if there are no suitable authors are available then they publish nothing. I read that Kranenborg could not find suitable authors for Opus Dei or the catholic church (I do not remember which one) and no article was published. The reason for this selection procedure is obvious: these professors, like Kranenborg, have no time to take years to study a single movement from nearby and using <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participant_observation.html" title="Participant observation">participant observation</a>. Apart from that, Nagel wrote in her 1994 article that it was written in close collaboration with Richard Singelenberg and Dutch psychology professor Piet Vroon. The first wrote quite a lot of articles about cults (too lenient and too sympathetically for my taste) and the latter a lot about SSB in Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant. Vroon was first neutral and interested in SSB but later became completely anti after a visit to the ashram and he became sometimes unreasonably and excessively critical. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries: I find it basically okay to use her 1994 article and I will give it the prominence that it deserves, that is a big promincence because it is the only peer reviewed article available world wide that does not only treat the belief and practices, based on hagiographical literature, but also the person of SSB. If other editors object to giving a big prominence to Nagel's article then I would like to hear new arguments for this, and I expect them to refer to policy and guidelines to back up their arguments.

<dd>One major difference that she explicitly states is that she was shocked to learn that SSB not only molested young men, but also boys and also the amount of money involved. Another major difference, but not essential and understandable, is that in her updated articles, she does not treat the controversy about SSB in the Netherlands extensively. The fourth major difference is of course, that in the 1994 article she only treated the inappropriate sexual approaches to Tal Brooke and Keith Ord and now the list is longer. I cannot think of any other major difference of her updated articles. She now uses two articles for what she wrote in 1994 in one article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 03:59, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would argue for caution in accepting the inclusion of this magazine as being <i>de facto</i> reputable. On a previous dispute with Andries, he included an article published in the same magazine written also by a student. This magazine publishes many types of articles, and is not a publication that publishes peer reviewed articles. One thing would be of interest: has Nagel been published at all in any peer reviewed publication?. Googling her name seeems only brings back sites related to critics, or <i>ahem</i> the articles in Wikipedia and Wikipedia mirrors. Having said that, her article should be cited in the article but within proportion to her reputation. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 05:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To answer Jossi's question whether Nagel has been published in a peer reviewed Journal, Nagel published an article about <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf_Messing_e41c.html" title="Wolf Messing">Wolf Messing</a> in relation to SSB in <i>Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie</i>/<i>Journal for parapsychology</i> 368, vol. 72 nr 4, Dec. 2005, pp. 14-17. It's in Dutch. She also thanked Robert Prddy and Brian Steel in that article for the information they provided in the after word. An unpublished older English language version of that article is linked to in that Wikipedia article. A <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> is fine to assess whether somebody is notable enough to have an article about, but it is not a good way to assess the reputability of sources. Also, it is my opinion that the quality of Nagel's article is better than the article by Haan that Jossi is referring to and that I have used a source in another article. It is my opinion that if you want to cite Nagel's article in proportion to the reputability of that article, relative to the reputability of other articles used as a source in the SSB article then Nagel's article deserves a prominent citation. Only the Daily Telegraph and India Today articles are as detailed and have equal or near-equal reputability, I think. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC) (amended for grammar)</dd>
<dd>It is true that the magazine sometimes accepts articles by guest contributors, but the status of the article is explicitly stated by the editor. Everything indicates that the article by Nagel was a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a> official publication by the Free University of Amsterdam, like the majority of the articles in that magazine. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:47, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A simple comparison of the three articles: <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i>, <i>"Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?"</i> and <i>"A Guru Accused"</i> shows that they are not one and the same. The only part that seems to be duplicated is the article about Deborah Swallow. Since <i>"Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?"</i> and <i>"A Guru Accused"</i> were not published in <b>any</b> notable references, they constitute original research. Also, to date, Andries has <b>never</b> claimed that the other 2 articles were taken from <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i>. This is a recent, newfound, revelation.</p>
<p>Also, it is important to point out that Alexandra Nagel is a self-professed Anti-Sai Activist since 1990. All of her writings are written from a critics POV. Her articles are not neutral and I have pointed out numerous errors in her writings. These writings were college assignments and Nagel rehashed the same information over and over. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 05:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jossie, I understand what you said. I am simply pointing out that Nagel is a critic. The way she is described by Andries, gives the impression that she is neutral.

<p>I agree. Her article, <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i> is published in a University Journal. Therefore, I have no problems if Andries cites that particular paper. I have problems when Andries tries to cite Nagel's other papers that were <b>never</b> published in any notable references. It appears that since Nagel had one article published in a notable reference, Andries is wrongfully elevating all of Nagel's papers to the same level. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 06:16, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Free University of Amsterdam. Despite the formal separation between Church and State (and thus education), one University, the Free University of Amsterdam (VU) has an interesting history in relation to creationism. The university has always traditionally been a 'Christian' university. Abraham Kuyper, a cleric and politician founded it in 1880. His intention with the University was to give the religious youth the possibility to profess science on biblical principles. Being an Orthodox Protestant, Kuyper was also strongly opposed to Darwinism. Nowadays the University still requires employees to be (Orthodox) Protestant.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This might explain why the University puts out an Anti-Sect Journal. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 06:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the VU's website:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Vrije Universiteit's origins are rooted in the Christian faith. This is why we attach such great importance to our social role. We take the view that academic work cannot be divorced from the concerns of society, in terms of standards, values, philosophy and religion.</dd>
<dd>Abraham Kuyper, Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905, founded Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 1880. At first the university was only open to Reformed Christians and was entirely financed by their fund-raising efforts and donations. Since the 1960s, however, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has been open to everyone and funded in the same way as the other Dutch universities, although it still retains its tradition of Christian standards and values. This finds expression in the emphasis placed upon social involvement in the university’s teaching and research programmes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When citing material published from this University, we need to provide to readers the very relevant information that that this University represents a Christian POV. I intent to add this statement to the <i>many</i> references added by Andries to many articles in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 06:06, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that the VU originally came from a Dutch reformed background is stated in the article VU and should be there and is unrelated to Nagel's article and should not be in the article SSB. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 11:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it is appropriate to state that Kranenborg comes from a Christian background when his writings are used as a source, because the Christian influences in his writings, especially in his earlier writings, can be discerned, but to mention this for every author that was published in the magazine that he edited, is, I think, incorrect and highly exaggerated. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A university that requires all his employees to be Ortodox Protestant, and that has in its stated mission wording related to the "uphlolding of Christian values", is important information that needs to be conveyed for NPOV. Imagine a magazine from IUM, in which an article is published about the evil of Western societies.

<dd>She has not written me about this. It is my assessment of her two articles, but I think that she did write to Moreno that the contents of her 1994 article is encapsulated by her two new articles.

<dd>Yes, the wording is fair and accurate if you insert the word "also" in "<i>while here later articles report ALSO upon other allegations of sexual misconduct.</i>" Of course nitpicking on the wording is possible and will likely occur, but it is basically fair and accurate. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:29, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>off topic Joe,/SSS108, And how dare you to complain about original research? If there is somebody who is guilty of publishing original research in Wikipedia then it is you. I find it difficult to accept such hypocritical remarks from you. If we only applied a fraction of the critical attitude that you reserve for Nagel to your homepage then information sourced to your homepage would have been gone long ago. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC) (amended for grammar)</dd>

Alexandra Nagel's article (name) was published in (name). What is reliability of this publication? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 03:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The magazine series is called <i>religieuze bewegingen in Nederland</i>/<i>Religious movements in the Netherlands</i> edited among others by <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reender_Kranenborg_f83b.html" title="Reender Kranenborg">Reender Kranenborg</a>, published by the Free University of Amsterdam press. It is the best source published in the Netherlands and sometimes (and in this case) the best in the world. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 04:01, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Why Nagel's article was published by the Free University of Amsterdam is a mystery. In 1994, Nagel had <b>no</b> credentials and no college accreditations. Even Andries cannot say how she got her paper published in this University Journal. No one knows what criteria were used to accept her paper. It is my opinion that the paper in question was a college assignment (just as Nagel stated her other papers were).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that the article was published, in 1994, in a University Journal specific to sects. The Journal is called <i>"Sekten"</i>. Nagel's article was called <i>"De Sai Paradox"</i>. It is published on Anti-Sai Sites only in Dutch. It has <b>not</b> been translated into English. I believe the relevant information is as follows: Free University Amsterdam; 'Sekten', 1994, nr. 29; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9053833412</a> <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 05:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
