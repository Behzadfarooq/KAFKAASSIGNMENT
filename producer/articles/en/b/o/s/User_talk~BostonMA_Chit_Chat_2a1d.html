<p>Gee, Marx wasnt even consistent with his own logic if he says a revolution could happen in Russia. I didnt know that. I mean, I already thought the logic of marxism was highly flawed given more information on market operations, but man! (Gibby 18:16, 11 December 2005 (UTC))</p>

<p>Among all the sections of the article, it is the most appropriate section for this material. Removing well referenced edits is a form of vandalism. Using an edit summary doesn't help. Also, the good faith is difficult to establish when viewed in light of the user's other edits where his edits bordered on POV pushing. <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> is a FA and you have done well by reverting his deletion. Again, if I were in your position, I'd ask him to follow wikiquette and not type in CAPs; to use talkpage as he was the one who initiated this disturbance in the article composition and to be more civil. Of course, <a href="../../../d/f/t/WP%7EDFTT_02aa.html" title="WP:DFTT">WP:DFTT</a> applies as well.

<p>I believe it is an egregious violation of POV. As for your question as to whether you should be participating there, I think you should decide it by yourself, going by your other priorities. I don't want to engage there, because I believe that it is one of the best papers in the world and I read it regularly and hence, I am apprehensive that this bias of mine can colour my views.

<p>I wish you would promote your own pictures, at least to me, as I have a hard time finding relevant pictures of India on Wiki Commons, usually only finding them by accident! As for the elephant picture, I can label it as "Countryside near Kalpetta" or something similar, as long as you do not think it would give a false impression. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 19:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added the elephant picture to <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalpetta.html" title="Kalpetta">Kalpetta</a> and unexpectedly found a street scene photo to add also. See what you think, and if you think it represents Kalpetta.

<p>Hesitant to rely on redirects as I know Admin (especially) and others hate them and think they cause confusion. One Admin told me there are 2 million useless redirect pages someone is going to have to clean up some day. There is also (or was) an anti-piping crusade going on for similar reasons i.e. confusion and complication. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 16:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But it is true researching the various water projects, I have come across all sorts of strange things about water controversies and companies that come up with complicated "water projects" involving several states, rivers. dams, canals and power transfer od water.</p>
<p>In fact I wrote an article originally aimed at temple tanks, entitled <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrigation_tank.html" title="Irrigation tank">Irrigation tank</a> -- don't like the name but couldn't think of anything else. But the article quickly became more complicated as I saw the ancient water conserving methods contrasted with today's high-tech methods amd people/states caught in the middle.</p>
<p>Take a look at the article, if you wouldn't mind. I keep finding unconnected articles on water projects but all the pieces are not being put together. Maybe you know what is happening and can help out or guide me in the right direction. Truthfully, I'm still at the level of trying to get the rivers straight and figuring out what basins they flow into.</p>

<dd>Well, there you have it in the comments from the person who made the mistake below. He is referring to a comment I made in another section, namely:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>When my user page was reverted: User:Mattisse‎; 18:53 . . contribs) (Revert to revision 73364465 dated 2006-09-02 07:33:12 by Netsnipe using popups) it was reverted to a point before the sockpuppet label was put on again, revealing personal information that I don't wish to be available for personal reasons and that I had removed long ago. So now I can't remove my own personal information that <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">User:Ekajati</a> chose to reveal. I was told that it was an administrator that was doing it (which I did not think an administrator would do without due process) so I did not believe that part. Nonetheless, what I want private is now there against my will and there is nothing I can do about it.</p>

<dd>The comments from the guy who made the mistake are below on your page and refer to this statement which, apparently in his eyes, is a sin. Either you read the actual comments and believe what was said on the link I sent you, in which was the ultimate conclusion was that my user page was left to me to do with it what I want), or you believe the guy who admitted he made a mistake. No one likes to admit he made a mistake (although he does in that link I gave you - and also on my talk page to me). In any case, I get the drift of this now. I thank you for being the friend you were before. And I don't hold it against you for believing your friend and sticking by him. I do think you meant well. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 00:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks so much for responding -- it truly helps me think good about people again. No I didn't really think I was in danger. First, I wasn't doing anything against any rules. Second, the driving forces in the beginning were not administrators. In fact, those same people had been told to back off recently by adminstrators. Third, what awful thing could happen to me? The worse outcome was what happened -- that two non- administrators got into an edit war over my personal user page, and an administrator got sucked into it and did exactly the wrong thing - as was pointed out in the link I sent you. Now he may have done that out of sheer misunderstanding (which is what he states in the link I sent you) or he may have been sucked into this clique that insists that Timmy12 and I are the same person and have done so multiple times (I now know from looking at his page). I didn't know about the <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmy12_3046.html" title="User:Timmy12">User:Timmy12</a> thing until yesterday and I was truly horrified.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've been attacked so many times by this particular clique of persons who want to "own" certain articles, that I am (almost) used to it. Plus there are experienced administrators who have seen me through many of these episodes and will tactfully do the right thing in the end (I believe). Plus, if it means I have to sell my soul to these people and obey their unethical edicts amd back off and overlook the bad things they are doing to Wikipedia, then I will not do that and I will accept the consequences. My nature is such that I am driven to keep the standards of Wikipedia high.</dd>

<dd>My fault is that I am too blunt and don't have enough patience with the "bowing and scraping" that is required to get along with some of these people. There is some middle road there that I must work on in my own behavior. But in reality, there is nothing they can do to me, except freak me out emotionally -- which they have succeeded in doing previously but I am working on that side of myself now. Compared to previous times, I handled this latest attack well, so maybe I can believe I am improving. It has been a struggle.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for letting me express all this. I had decided to desert India entirely, but it would be a loss to me. I have been interested in other areas before and can find another area if necessry.
