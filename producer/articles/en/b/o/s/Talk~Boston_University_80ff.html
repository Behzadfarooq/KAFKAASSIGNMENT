<p>I added a to-do list, since it pains me to see how underdeveloped my <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_mater.html" title="Alma mater">alma mater</a> is in comparison to some of the other university pages out there.

<dd>I just redid the Academics section a bit. I think the list format is a little easier to read. If someone is feeling abitious, they could write articles for each of the colleges, with a list of majors offered. I also mentioned the study abroad programs, but I don't have all of the information for that. With a little work, we could turn this around quite a bit. Jon Seitz 05:21, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I bumped with West Campus information down to the dorms section where it belongs, but with a few photos and some more details on the other dorm options, you could probably spin off a sub-page Boston University student housing with the info from <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Towers_012a.html" title="Warren Towers">Warren Towers</a> and some of the StuVi section. The most glaring omission to my eyes right now is the lack of Silber's history in shaping the university, but my internet connection is too spotty right now for me to do much research on that at the moment. --<a href="../../../m/c/_/User%7EMC_MasterChef_eb58.html" title="User:MC MasterChef">MC MasterChef</a> 05:44, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The mention of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">BC</a> has been removed.

<p>^ I think it's important to keep the BU/BC line. Along with being hockey rivals, people who know be but don't go to BU constantly mix it up and say I go to BC. Also I don't think that it's all that important to go into too much detail on the individual majors and such, as that kind of information can easily be found on BU's website. Just my $0.02.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And just my 2 cents. <i>No</i> <b>BU</b> student says he goes to <b>BC</b>. However, i agree that many people when describing BU students will say BC. -<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisismikesother_a462.html" title="User:Thisismikesother">Michael</a> 06:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question from User:65.96.188.220: Where did Howard Stern or Martin Luther King Junior live while in attendance?</p>
<p>Howard Stern I don't know, as for MLK in my dorm, Myles Standish Hall, there is a plaque denoting him as a famous resident at one time or another. --<a href="../../../o/k/i/User%7EOkieman1200_1e58.html" title="User:Okieman1200">Okieman1200</a> 08:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Where is that plaque? I lived in Myles two years ago and don't remember ever seeing it. --Masoni 23:21, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's in the first floor lobby, right at the bottom of the stairs. It's a framed picture of Myles as a hotel and has a lot of written information on it.

<p>This section is getting quite well-developed, particularly the student housing parts (though more can probably be said about facilities -- Marsh Chapel, the GSU, the labs at the Photonics Center, for example).

<p>I have just added a little section about the Castle and the Pub. (CAS 2001, GRS 2004 here) I remember the tale of the castle from the campus tour, but i cannot find information to back it up. However, i still find it to be a bit of interesting info to be included. With the Castle section, i added a bit of info about the Pub as well (i think it is the only official on campus bar, correct me if i am wrong). I also added a more detailed description of the Bay State and South campus areas (i lived in the Common ground (156-8 BSR) and South Campus myself). Last time i visited campus, the new Hillel is going up. I wonder if it is finished yet. --<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud001_1db5.html" title="User:Bud001">Bud</a> 06:54, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thats cool. I liked that little patch of grass though. it gives a lot of light. There used to be a fountain there too, but was removed a while back. Oh god. i am getting old. Is the Common Ground renovated yet? It has been promised ti be redone ever since i started living there in 1998 (i lucked out and got a single there as a freshman). It is still kinda a mess when i left in 2000. BTW, i dont know why they called it Common ground house. Everyone seem to develop intense dislike of each other when i lived there.

<p>Now that come to think of it: what happened to the ORIGINAL Hillel? did they occupy both buildings or did BU took back the original Hillel for other purposes?

I can never confirm it, if anyone know anthing about that, let me know. --<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud001_1db5.html" title="User:Bud001">Bud</a> 06:54, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article was dated 20 September 2002. I don't think such old sources should be quoted on Wiki for articles like this, or if they are, the information from the source should be verified. The information on the article claims that the first 52 schools are considered top tier, while those after 52 are listed in alphabetical order. A quick look at the 2006 rankings shows that this is no longer true, and the rankings of schools make sense since schools fall into the general area they belong. One must remember that having a strictly objective hierarchy of schools is impossible.</dd>

<dd>Bud, in response to your query, U.S. News ranks schools according to criteria like: freshman retention rank, acceptance rate, graduation rates, financial resources, student-to-faculty ratio, freshman in top 10% of class etc. By comparing BU's numbers to the schools above it, one can easily see how its relative ranking comes about. Here are some statistics from the Princeton Review, which, in my experience, is far more reliable than U.S. News because they only list stats and do not establish a hierarchy:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Freshman retention rate: 91% (which is not very high compared to other top and/or more popular schools)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Acceptance rate: 57% (this is one statistic you will not likely come across on the BU campus. Most of the time, people talk about the 4000 out of 30000 applicants who ENROLL)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4-year graduation rate: 65%, 6-yr graduation rate: 77%</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>An endowment of slightly over $700 mil. While this is significantly large, it pales in comparison to the $1.2 bil of Boston College, the $1.4 bil of NYU, and, going further up the U.S.News list, the $3.5 bil of Rice, $12 bil of Yale and $25 bil of Harvard)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Student to faculty ratio: 12:1 (very large, compared to the single digit ratios of the higher ranked schools)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Freshman in top 10% of class: 58%</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All these factors contribute towards pushing BU lower in the rankings. Of course, this has no implication on how good individual classes are. Also the Times Higher Education Supplement rankings, as well as the SJTU rankings are in their infancy and fundamentally flawed. THES seems to favor LARGE and historically well known schools. This is obvious since large schools typically have the most diverse student bodies who will spread the name of the university wherever they go in the world. THES bases its ranking very heavily on reputation and opinion rather than facts. This explains an upward jump of 45 places for Duke in one year, a WORLD ranking of 15 for UT-Austin and other such insane anomalies. For American schools, the best source of information is the Princeton Review. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.225.190.133 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.225.190.133_3ca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.225.190.133">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Grade deflation is not an official policy. Often, this is the result of faculty meetings and general administration directive, and up to the discretion of the professor.

<dl>
<dd>I don't know if it's an official policy or not, but I can tell you that at the beginning of my psychology 101 class last semester, the professor told us that out of a class of 200, there were going to be about 15 A's awarded, because "we have grade deflation at BU." this stuff definitely happens, but I don't suppose it would be an official policy. How would one word such a policy? sounds difficult --<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 05:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was there for 6 years. Many professors often tell the kids that there is only X-number of As available. Then they grade on the curve (so if 20 A are allocated, then the first 20, regardless of actual percentage, get A, and the rest get B, C and so on). Its not exactly unusual and not officially grade deflation.</dd>
<dd>In a way, i understands BU's view. Whats the worth of a cum laude/Magna cum Laude/Summa cum Laude if everyone gets one?--<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud001_1db5.html" title="User:Bud001">Bud</a> 06:05, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose my main objection to its inclusion in the present form is the unverifiability of it. All we have is a couple anecdotes about professors who said there was grade deflation. Whether it's "official" or "unofficial" is besides the point, as it's presented. Maybe we could change the language to something like "Many students believe..." or something along those lines? Unless we actually have some sort of verifiable information, it really ought not be included. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaomni_4fbb.html" title="User:Metaomni">Metaomni</a> 21:53, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am going to create a new sub-section under campus and facilities. before the sub section, i will describe the campus, and provide a general sktetch. Then in the new seb section i am going to provide a more detailed description of the East of Kenmore, Kenmore, East campus , West campus, Central campus, everything west of west campus, and South campuses,along with any distinctive landmarks, like the Citgo sign (Kenmore), the SMG (East), Warren Towers/Main Marsh Sq. buildings (central), StuVil and West Camp (west) and South campus. Each section of the campus would be divided into landmarks, notable buildings, and student housing facilities.</p>
<p>Sounds like an interesting idea. Will you be including landmarks like The Dugout?</p>

<p>I plan to add all notable facilities, whether they belong to BU or not. I am a BU Grad myself (BA CAS 2001, MA GRS 2004) so i am pretty familiar with most places except the new rec center. The reason of making that "tour" is because BU is a very east-west oriented campus with very distinct areas. It would be helpful to take a visitor from east to west. Also, some of the buildings are relatively unknown unless you know where it is (For example, Danielson hall on Beacon is actually the eastern-most point of the campus, but unlesss you know people staying there, it is not known). --<a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud001_1db5.html" title="User:Bud001">Bud</a> 07:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the gradschool finder website, BU's economics department ranks in the top 20 for PhD, and biomedical engineering is ranked 4th in the country. I do not know how reliable of a source this is, I do know that the biomed engineering department is highly regarded, as are the departments in economics and international realtions (so much so that there is talk of a school of international relations forming). The college of communications is also highly regarded, and as the oldest methodist seminary in the county, the school of theology also carries serious weight. Where can actually ranking be found? I'm not sure. Ranking schools of theology, communications, and individual departments does not sell very many magazines.</p>

<p>I see that Alhutch has modified the initial description of BU to call it a "research university" rather than simply a "university." It seems to me that this adds sylables but not information.

I've also dealt with staff and some facultywho were based at other universities. My impression was that research was conducted at all and that calling an institution a "research university" was about as useful as declaring a high school to be a "teaching high school."

<dd>A research university is one that engages in research and not only teaching. Many colleges - especially smaller liberal arts schools - around the US do not engage in a significant amount of research and are dedicated solely to teaching undergraduate students. A research university must offer doctoral degrees and be engaged in significant research. Delphi53 13:59, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not all universities have extensive PhD or research programs. Smallers ones like St. Lawrence University, and even prestigious schools like Boston College, and Tufts Univeristy have very small PhD programs. Like many other universities, research is a central part of what goes on at BU Significantly more money was spent this year (and every year) on research and research facilities, and there are currently well over 100 PhD candidates, and almost 100 more MD candidates studying at BU right now. The same could be said for Umass or Harvard. This distinguishes BU as a research university and should be added because it is central to what the school is.</p>

<p>Because it adds nothing to the article. It is not a landmark, by any means, on campus, nor is it visually pleasing.

<dd>The message above was posted on 21 September, quite a long time after the question was posted. So I want to ask the responder, who was using an annonymous form of access, whether he has a connection with the BU campus that would lead to his understanding the place of that small structure? So far this is the only image offered that provides any view, if only in background, of the original buildings that were built circa 1938.

<p>Pjorg has updated the info box with such information as the names of the current President and Vice-President of the Student Body. That seems rather ephemeral to me, and inappropriate for this location. Will Pjorg undertake to update this part of the article after each student government election? If not, I would suggest that this infomration belongs elsewhere, perhaps in a section or article on Student Government at BU.</p>
<p>In general the info box seems to be getting longer and longer. Are we adding items that are non-standard for a University Info Box? Should this be a more limited entry? Requesting comments for more experienced Editors.</p>

<dd>These are fields that appear in the infobox template, so I assumed that there was already a consensus that this information was pertinent. I have no problem updating the box on a yearly basis, but even if I didn't there's certainly a healthy editor community here on this article; I'm sure someone would take care of it.</dd>

<dd>In my opinion not every field in the template necessarily needs to be used. But I guess my main concern is aesthetics - the box is getting to be too long for the section it resides in. Some of the most recently added lines contribute double to that since the titles take two lines. (and why are they in red?) In fact, if they are to remain, those lines should be even longer. I think the year of office should be shown if you are going to list a student body president.</dd>

<p>I've been trying to find a citation for this information, and it's occurred to me that it only applies to CAS. This further led me to realize that all the colleges and schools individually dictate standards - I don't believe there are any university-wide regulations to this end.</p>

<p>I doubt that you are. Sometimes diffrerent departments set different standards, particularly in such a large school as the CAS. BTW, the castle tale, as i said, is lore, and is repeated many many times on campus tours.

<dd>Nice article. It provides me with a much better view of what happened as all I had before was the completely uninformative letter to alumni announcing that Goldin had withdrawn. I don't see a really good place to link this to the main article at the moment, but I am going to add a list of the University's presidents in the article very soon and will expand the history section further. That will provide a reasonable place for a link. In the meantime, your article should be included in the BU category. <a href="../../../p/z/a/User%7EPzavon_ab25.html" title="User:Pzavon">Pzavon</a> 15:41, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look at the BU category page listing, you will see what I think is a rather good article covering the Goldin "Presidency" I believe Bud001 wrote it, and I intend to link to it when I (or someone else) bring the general history to that point. I don't think it would be appropriate to list Goldin as a President of the University.

<dd>Correct on both counts, but both of those sections are fairly weak—the history is missing large portions of time. I think it's a better strategy to create new articles where we know we can make it fairly complete.</dd>

<p>IMHO, there is no need for an encyclopedia article to contain information about the dormitory guest policy or other such information. A lot of this material belongs on the "prospective students" page of the BU website and need not be reproduced here.<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurpleChez_0492.html" title="User:PurpleChez">PurpleChez</a> 03:37, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The guest policy is particularly notable at BU due to the controversy surrounding it and the virtually universal belief among the student body that it is excessively prohibitive. I would agree, however, that there is no reason to duplicate the terms of the policy in its entirety, and that a few sentences in the main BU article is sufficient. The policy can be given a more thorough treatment somewhere else, such as the Housing System article. -<a href="../../../p/j/o/User%7EPjorg_e8e3.html" title="User:Pjorg">Pjorg</a> 13:21, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that we here at BU like to think that we're the biggest and baddest, Warren towers is not actually the largest dorm in the US. A simple check of the BU housing website (<a href="http://www.bu.edu/housing/residences/largedorms/warren.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bu.edu/housing/residences/largedorms/warren.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/housing/residences/largedorms/warren.html</a>) lists its capacity at 1797. And I won't even get into the argument over whether or not Warren Towers is actually 3 dorms or not. In any case, the Jester Center at University of Texas at Austin houses 2,945 (<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/?site=1&amp;scode=4&amp;id=140" class="external free" title="http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/?site=1&amp;scode=4&amp;id=140" rel="nofollow">http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/?site=1&amp;scode=4&amp;id=140</a>), which is quite a bit more.

<p>On 6 February 2007 you removed categories related to BU's Methodist affilliation from the main <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> article because, as you said "BU no longer maintains any religious affilliation." BU as a University has not had a Methodist affiliation for many years. In fact, from the 1869 Charter I believe no part of the University other than Theology had a formal religious affiliation. I believe the School of Theology has maintained its affiliation from the beginning, thus making those category links appropriate. <a href="../../../p/z/a/User%7EPzavon_ab25.html" title="User:Pzavon">Pzavon</a> 03:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
