<p>I would not be surprised if there is a local and/or historical name for this circle; does anyone know it? Plus, the original author indicates there are alternative spellings - could these be used to fill out the article a bit rather than just redirects?<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with the above - and I'm the original author. I don't have enough info to hand about variant spellings or other names to add to the article as yet. The redirects I created were to catch variant spellings in use in other Wikipedia articles, and to make searching easier. Spellings I have seen are 'Boscawen-Un', 'Boscawen-un', 'Boscawen-Ã›n', - and the same but without the hyphens. I've also seen 'Boscawenun'. Ordnance Survey has a small settlement/farm called 'Boscawen-noon' in the same grid square. If anyone can help on this I would be very grateful. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 08:53, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(To DuncanHill)Yup, I am aware that you were the original author but by placing the Penwith template on the talkpage I have (hopefully) alerted other members of the Project to the existance of this article, so I versed my comments to include any other reader as well. Since one of them has just finished an excellent job on <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Buryan_9284.html" title="St Buryan">St Buryan</a> it may be that they will be able to help.</dd>
<dd>I still think adding the various spellings into the main text will be helpful, since a search result for one will also give a reader all the other alternatives without them duplicating their search - likewise if there is a local/historical name.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 10:22, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would choose the most commonly used name and then bung the others in brackets after the first mention e.g St Buryan (sometimes St Burian). I can ask around about Boscawen-Un if you like. Its only a two mile walk for me at present so I could also go over to the circle and see if there is a plaque or something. Would also give me the opportunity to get some pictures <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 11:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PS thanks for the praise on St Buryan <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a>;) I'm afraid its not finished yet though - i still have lots to write! <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a></p>

<dd>Most of those variant spellings (e.g. with hyphen or without, capitalized or not) are pretty superficial and are just likely to create clutter. I wouldn't mention them in the article itself, but make redirects from each. That circumflex could be worth a mention, though; there can't be too many places in Britain outside Wales that use it!</dd>

<p>The most common spelling locally (apparently) is Boscawen-Un. The plaque at the site uses the hyphen, but not the circumflex <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 22:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In academic works its referred to as Boscawen-Un (with the hyphen, without circumflex!) - apparently it means 'the elder tree on the downs'. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimChampion_8bfe.html" title="User:JimChampion">JimChampion</a> 00:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've taken several photos of the circle this week which I will upload drekkly. Unfortunately due to the position of the circle within a small enclosure it wasn't possible to get the whole circle in one shot. I will upload what I have and people can tell me which ones they like best. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 22:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>With regard to the photographs, there's no need to make extra work for yourself. I and many others have taken photos of this site (although admittedly its difficult to get an overall view without going airborne because of the enclosure). Follow the link from the 'external links' section to the Megalithic Portal page. Ask people there if they are willing for you to re-use their pictures. I've uploaded one of mine onto wikimedia commons and put it into the gallery on the Boscawen Un page. Two of the photos that are already in the gallery are not really suitable - the inclusion of a bright sky has made the foreground detail too dark and the stones cannot be clearly seen. I could digitally manipulate them to bring out the foreground detail but its probably easiest to replace them. I'll leave that to someone else as I don't want to butt in too much. Also - the leaning central pillar makes this stone circle very distinct. I'll upload one of my pictures of it shortly and put it in the gallery. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimChampion_8bfe.html" title="User:JimChampion">JimChampion</a> 11:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added the OS grid reference to the article - is there a way of linking it to a mapping service eg 'Getamap' so that readers can click on the grid ref and be taken to a map? <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanHill_840f.html" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> 08:55, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is possible - see <a href="http://uk.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?place=SW412274&amp;db=grid&amp;scale=25000&amp;GridE=141200&amp;GridN=27400&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;mapsize=big&amp;cat=des" class="external text" title="http://uk.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?place=SW412274&amp;db=grid&amp;scale=25000&amp;GridE=141200&amp;GridN=27400&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;mapsize=big&amp;cat=des" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example. Its seems to be done automatically in the infoboxes for places (e.g. <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glastonbury.html" title="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a>).

<p>Is it known/speculated that the leaning stone was placed at an angle, or whether is is irregular subsidence?<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 14:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll quote directly from Aubrey Burl's authoritative volume "The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany" (Revised edition, Yale University Press, 2000) page 170: "<i>When Boscawen-Un was trenched around in 1864 no deposits were found at its base. The diggers believed '<b>that it was carefully placed in its leaning position</b>'. More sensibly Stukely thought that '<b>somebogdy digging by it to find treasure disturbed it.</b></i>" From the same book, I've read that its likely that the central stone was there first - a solitary standing stone like many others in West Penwith from the Neolithic era. The ring of smaller stones around it may have been a later addition (Bronze age), as at Callanish in the outer Hebrides. Central stones are unusual in SW stone circles - only others are at the Stripple Stones and the Hurlers on Bodmin. I'll leave you with a Boscawen-Un anecdote from the same book - "<i>When the late Peter Pool, a student of linguistics and amateur archaeologist, was clearing a path to the Boscawen-Un ring he was flabbergasted to see a number of naked women dancing and chanting inside the stones. he coughed discreetly. Perhaps too discreetly. Only when their rites were completed to the party's unclad satisfaction did the celebrants disperse</i>". The path from the A30 was well-cleared (by PAROW?) when I visited in August - easily navigated it in the dark. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimChampion_8bfe.html" title="User:JimChampion">JimChampion</a> 00:01, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another unusual feature of this stone circle (amongst its contemporaries in Penwith) is that one the stones in the circle is different to the others... the stone that the central pillar leans away fromis a big quartz block. I don't have a good photo of this stone (either due to shadows or taking a long exposure at night using a torch for lighting). Are there any interpretations of this stone, if it has any special 'significance'? I've read stuff about the pillar and quartz representing 'male and female energies' but this is a bit vague. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimChampion_8bfe.html" title="User:JimChampion">JimChampion</a> 10:53, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
