	    <p>ˌ==Ethnic cleansing; anti-Serb sentiment==</p>
<p>I said that I will not come to this talk page again, but I have to answer some claims here. I will not discuss here any more history of RS, but, Joy, just look this again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosanska_Krajina" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosanska_Krajina" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosanska_Krajina</a> See what is written there: "The numbers are still not determined but it is estimated that anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000 Bosnians were executed as part of the ethnic cleansing campaign of the Bosnian Serbs". The person who wrote this (I will not name this person) accused the whole Serbian nation (not only responsible individuals) for ethnic cleansing against "Bosnians" (What ever "Bosnians" are in this case). Yet, the same person didn’t wanted to say that Serbs were ethnically cleansed from parts of Bosanska Krajina (And many Serbs were executed too). We know that Serbs were majority in Bosanski Petrovac, Drvar, Bosansko Grahovo, Glamoc and Kupres. It is obvious that Serbs were ethnically cleansed from that parts of Bosanska Krajina, but somebody didn’t wanted to mention this. And you claim that these articles are not anti-Serb. Ok, you don’t have to trust me, I do not live in RS, but ask some Serb who live in RS and he will tell you are these articles anti-Serb or not. And I will not write article about history of Serbs in BIH/RS (If somebody else want to write this article, he is free to do that). My intention only was to write an early history of RS, but I can`t work with people who have political attitude. RS is mainly populated with Serbs and I regard every attempt to delete history of Serbs from early history of RS as attack on these Serbs. For example, you will never see me to write anything about Serb history in Kosovo page of wikipedia, because Kosovo is mainly populated with Albanians (And you will also never see me to delete history of Albanians there). Unlike some people, I am tolerant towards other nations, but I have zero tolerance towards certain political attitudes. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p>There is a stetement in this article which notes that a great number of Bosanska Krajina inhabitants were killed in Jasenovac concentration camp during WWII. If one follows that article one could find that they were predominantly Serbs and no one could deny it.<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a></p>
<p>Actually, there is no mention in the article that killed individuals were predominantly Serbs. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p>Number between 10000 and 30000 is the number of missing people from this region and as in the case of Srebrenica it is a fair statement that these people may have been killed given that the region was also the place of concentration camps during Bosnian War. Some 500 corpses that were found in mass graves in Bosanska Krajina are being identified as we speak and additional 450 are awaiting identification. ICTY is also currently investigating a potential genocide in this region. There are maybe few sentences that may need to be slightly revised but the article as a whole is far from not being neutral and factually correct.<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a></p>
<p>My objection was that Serb people were accused for ethnic cleansing instead of the RS authorities. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p>Continued personal attacks and attempts to discredit my contributions to Wikipedia as political propaganda are pure non-sense.<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a></p>
<p>I do not continue to attack you personally, my objections simply referred about neutrality of your views. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p>I am not an anti-Serb nor do I have an anti-Serb agenda. On the other hand I have a feeling that there is reasoning among some that if articles are not presenting a pure Serb nationalistic propaganda than they must be anti-Serb.I know many Serbs who would widely object to such reasoning including people who live in RS.<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a></p>
<p>Do you even know how Serbian propaganda looks like? If I were a Serbian propagandist, I would speak something like this: "All of Bosnia is Serbian land and there is no Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia, because they are actually islamised and catholicised Serbs". That is how Serbian propaganda looks like. But, did you see me wrote this? You didn’t. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p>Finally if you present information in this article that are factualy correct and proven and not based on assumptions, half truths and widely believed legends I will have no problems with you edits --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to do that, but I do not know from where to start (to much errors in it). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<p><br />
I have made a correction to indicate that the ethnic cleansing was commited by RS. I made a statement in original version on this article that majority of people killed at Jasenovac were Serbs however it was removed by other users since there is a whole other article that talks specifically about Jasenovac. I had an unfortunate fate in my life to personaly experience a full range of unprovoked Serbian nationalistic propaganda from mild insinuations to outright threats. I don't need to be lectured on that issue.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 21:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
