<p>Because of the chemical plant explosion in Romulus, MI, the metro Detroit ABC affiliate did not air the August 9 episode of <i>Boston Legal</i>. (Or maybe they aired at some sleepy hour). I suppose next week they'll air the second episode of the season, and I'll be watching.

<p>I made a couple updates (anonymously, oops) that pertain to season two which is airing now; I added Betty White as a character, I agree that she should get a mention if for no other reason than her current major plot involvement.</p>
<p>Should we break apart the characters section into main characters, supporting characters, and regular guests? The opening credits this season list James Spader, Julie Bowen, Mark Valley, Rene Auberjonois, Justin Mentell, Ryan Michelle Bathe, Candice Bergen, and William Shatner as the main cast.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly we'll be seeing a bit more of Rhona Mitra, Rupert Everett, et al.</p>
<p>Why does Julie Bowen's page give her character a different name?</p>
<p>--Cgrocki 23:46, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For many shows, breaking the section "into main characters, supporting characters, and regular guests" would be an excellent idea. But David E. Kelley's shows tend to have revolving door casts. For example, (this is purely for the sake of example) Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra) could come into the foreground big time for a multi-episode arc then recede deep into the background later. She could leave the show altogether in season 4 then come back for the last two episodes of the series. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Happelberg_01a2.html" title="User:Robert Happelberg">Robert Happelberg</a> 21:22, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sara wasn't introduced in the first season, but in the second season premiere. The one who wrote that she appeared in the first season must have confused her with Chelina Hall, who appeared in the last few episodes of season 1 and was also African-American. The character was quite similar, though, just like Lori is similar to Hannah Rose, a Crane, Poole and Schmidt junior partner from 8th season of The Practice, who was also an ex-DA. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAusir_735a.html" title="User:Ausir">Ausir</a> 02:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cannot find any corroboration that Candice Bergen's character of Shirley Schmidt was ever in any episode of "The Practice." Can this be verified? --Esjones 15:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A quick scan of Bergen's IMDB page doesn't turn up any mentions of <i>The Practice</i>. It's possible the character could have been played by another actress, but I think I would spot every reference to the <i>The Practice</i> on <i>Boston Legal</i> (such as the California judge played by Anthony Heald). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Happelberg_01a2.html" title="User:Robert Happelberg">Robert Happelberg</a> 15:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added information about Chelina Hall to the list of recurring characters. Having appeared in four S1 episodes and at least one S2 episode, I believe she qualifies for inclusion.

<p>Maybe I'm just overexaggerating, but is it me or are there lots of Star Trek regulars popping up on this show. Obviously, Shatner and Auberjonois are regulars. Well, on tonights episode, Armin Shimerman was the judge. Have there been others, or am I remembering wrong. And, if so, can we add a brief list to the trivia section? <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJPG-GR_8f4b.html" title="User:JPG-GR">JPG-GR</a> 06:00, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed this too - although I'm only an occasional viewer of the show (it's on at a stupid time here in Oz) the frequency of seeing former Star Trek actors is something I've commented on to friends before. I also remembered seeing <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeri_Ryan_5575.html" title="Jeri Ryan">Jeri Ryan</a> on the show and her article tells me she was a guest on two episodes. --<a href="../../../l/b/f/User%7ELbft_2228.html" title="User:Lbft">lbft</a> 12:58, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Ethan Phillips (Neelix from Star Trek: Voyager) appeared as the father of the accused in the arc involving the murder of the wife of the judge played by Armin Shimmerman near the beginning of season three. Currently (as of December 2006) Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Trek: The Next Generation are the only iterations of Star Trek not to be represented by an appearance of a primary cast member on Boston Legal. However, the recurring character of Judge Paul Resnik (who has been in five episodes of the show) is played by Michael Ensign who has also guest starred on every modern series of Trek. Also, John DeLancie (Q in the Next Generation as well as Voyager and Deep Space Nine) has appeared on both The Practice and Ally McBeal (both of which exist in the "same universe" as Boston Legal) so I wouldn't be suprised to see him make an appearance in a future show - and I'm sure that if we expanded the search to include the whole of the Ally McBeal / The Practice / Boston Legal universe we could find many more links.</dd>

<dd>No, you're right, there have been a TON of Star Trek alums on this show. I'd be curious to know if there's a reason, i.e. David E. Kelley is a fan of Star Trek, or one of the old Trek casting directors or producers work on the show. I haven't found anything though</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it's old acting alums enjoying playing off each other. A similar confluence occurred during Disney's <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gargoyles.html" title="Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a>, with a decent chunk of the bridge crew of <i>Next Generation</i>. Perhaps the quality of Star Trek's actors is the key. Disguised by facial prosthetics, the actors must make a connection to the audience largely through eye movements and vocal talent. Perhaps it's simply that so many character actors have appeared on Star Trek while they were largely unknown to the public. Or perhaps they're all trying to overcome <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typecasting.html" title="Typecasting">typecasting</a>, something at which Mark Hamil has not been seen as successful. --205.201.141.146 19:47, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only source for the criticism section is an article from a clearly bias source that prides "combating liberal media bias".
