	    <p>Among four year institutions, <b><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a>'s housing system</b> is the nation's 10th largest, with 76% of the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undergraduate_education.html" title="Undergraduate education">undergraduate</a> population living on campus. BU was originally a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commuting.html" title="Commuting">commuter</a> school, but the University now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. This is a challenge considering the size of BU's undergraduate population and its urban setting. BU meets this goal every year, although in the fall the University generally relies on area <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">hotels</a> to house residents.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: Housing Selection">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Housing Selection</span></h2>
<p>Every spring, returning students who have submitted a housing deposit for the ensuing academic year are entered into a lottery to determine their priority in selecting housing. Priority is assigned within classes, with seniors receiving the lowest (best) numbers, and second semester freshmen the highest. I.e., the "worst" senior number is always better than the best junior number, et cetera. Entering freshman are allocated housing based on an online housing questionnaire.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: Dining Services">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dining Services</span></h2>
<p>Boston University requires that all students living in <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dormitory.html" title="Dormitory">dormitories</a> be enrolled in a year-long meal plan. The plans offer differing ratios of meals and dining points, depending on which is chosen. Meals are used to gain access to one of the university’s five residential dining service locations on an all-you-can-eat basis (at West Campus, Warren Towers, The Towers, Shelton Hall, and Myles Standish Hall) and dining points can be used at designated eateries around campus on a cash basis. A Kosher plan exists which can be used at the Kosher dining hall at the Hillel House. Combined with housing costs, meal plans can cause room and board to be quite expensive. This has created a high demand for on-campus apartment housing, as the University does not require residents with access to a kitchen to purchase a plan (although they may if they so choose.) However, the higher price of such housing often offsets any savings. Considering the food is cafeteria food, its quality is very high. In addition, the main dining halls contain large selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and "late night".</p>

<p>BU's first large dormitory was a former hotel. The Myles Standish Hotel in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenmore_Square_8955.html" title="Kenmore Square">Kenmore Square</a> was built in 1925 and was purchased by BU in 1949.

<p>Most of the rooms in Myles are suites of one double and one single, with a shared bathroom. Often the person in the single must walk through the double to get to the bathroom. There are also doubles with and without bathrooms, as well as singles.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: Shelton Hall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shelton Hall</span></h3>
<p>Another large dormitory, Shelton Hall on Bay State Road was once the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starwood_Hotels_%26_Resorts_Worldwide_81cc.html" title="Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide">Sheraton Hotel</a>. Playwright <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_O%27Neill_7874.html" title="Eugene O'Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> died in suite 401 on the 4th floor of Shelton Hall. In his honor, the 4th floor was named a specialty housing area called the Writer's Corridor. It is said that this corridor is haunted by the playwright and as such, Shelton is the only haunted building on campus. The building houses 418 residents. The ninth floor consists of a study lounge that provides an impressive view of Boston and the Charles River. The dining hall of Shelton serves students who reside in the lower Bay State Road area.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: The Towers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Towers</span></h3>
<p>Located on Bay State Road, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towers_%28Boston_University%29_c688.html" title="Towers (Boston University)">Towers</a> was the first University constructed building designated to be a dormitory. The facility houses 523 residents in its two eight floor towers. The floors are single sex (usually alternating floors). The Towers dining hall is located in the basement, and is the primary dining facility for the entire Upper Bay State Road housing area. While the dining hall doesn't have any windows, it is almost always much less crowded. The building also houses the Franklin Lounge (with a big screen TV) and a game room, and is the home of the only DVD rental program in the housing system.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: Warren Towers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Warren Towers</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Towers_012a.html" title="Warren Towers">Warren Towers</a>, which is the largest dorm on campus, houses about 600 students in each of its three towers. Access to the building is via escalator to the fourth floor, where the building’s dining hall and other amenities are located. The floors 5-18 are residential floors. The first three floors and basement house a University parking garage and street-level retail establishments.</p>
<p>Most freshmen live in Warren Towers, though there is also significant retention of sophomores. The majority of rooms are identical double-occupancy floorplans, the exception being single rooms, the occasional quad, and the corner doubles. Corner doubles are almost twice the size of a standard double room and are coveted by those residents selecting housing in Warren.</p>
<p>All floors are divided by gender, with females on one side of the hall and men on the other side, each with their own bathroom. Some floors are same sex, but the majority are coeducational (the same is true for West Campus). Warren residents use common bathrooms having between 2 to 4 shower stalls, depending on the floor and tower.</p>
<p>The fourth floor of Warren features several study lounges with wireless internet access in most, a screening room, a laundry room, a music room, a game room, and computer lab. Two of the three towers also have small laundry rooms on the 5th floor instead of study lounges, but most students tend to use the large laundry facility on the fourth floor near C Tower.</p>
<p>The recently-renovated dining hall in Warren is one of the largest in the BU housing system, serving not only Warren Tower residents but also residents of South Campus dormitories and other students from the smaller residences along Commonwealth Avenue. Because of its central location on campus, the Warren dining hall is also popular with students who live on other parts of campus but take their classes in central BU area.</p>

West Campus' three high-rise dorms overlook <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickerson_Field_65a8.html" title="Nickerson Field">Nickerson Field</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the western edge of campus surrounding BU’s <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickerson_Field_65a8.html" title="Nickerson Field">Nickerson Field</a> is West Campus, with three <a href="../../../h/i/g/High-rise.html" title="High-rise">high-rises</a> each housing well over 600 residents. They are named Claflin, Sleeper and Rich hall after BU's founders. Residents of West generally prefer it over other locations and cite its "campusy" feel and proximity to the Student Village complex and other athletic facilities. Student athletes are abundant here, for that reason. CGS and CFA students also tend to prefer living at West campus, as it is the closest dormitory style residence to those two schools.</p>
<p>West's dining hall is cited as one of the best on campus. Instead of the typical "buffet style" cafeteria mode, the dining hall is equipped with numerous food stations (burrito, pasta/Asian noodle toss, vegetarian/vegan, grill, pizza, etc.) where a cook will prepare individual food servings on demand.</p>

<p>Often forgotten, Danielsen Hall actually demarcates the BU campus’ easternmost limit, at its 512 Beacon Street address. As it is the only large dorm on campus without a dining hall, Danielsen residents must eat at Myles, or another dining location. However, the dorm does have a kitchen located in the basement. Danielsen, while a bit of a distance from central campus, has the advantage of being closer to the city. Newbury Street, for example is just a few blocks away. The Boston University Shuttle (BUS) picks up in front of Danielsen regularly, making the distance to campus much more tolerable.</p>

<p>Once an up and coming neighborhood of affluent <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Brahmin_dd07.html" title="Boston Brahmin">Boston Brahmins</a>, the majority of Bay State Road is now owned by Boston University for housing and office use (the most notable office use being the Office of Admissions, at 121 Bay State Road). Due to their small size, the brownstones on Bay State are inherently suited for use as specialty housing, and many are used in this fashion. When used as a dormitory, most of the Bay State Road residences are divided into double and triple rooms with some singles. Most houses have floors that share a bathroom, a room for the resident assistant on the ground floor, and laundry facilities in the basement. Some rooms have private bathrooms. While some of the houses are rather well-worn, BU has undertaken a project that each summer renovates selected residences to restore the Bay State Road houses to their 19th century appearance and ambience.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: South Campus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">South Campus</span></h3>
<p>South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Turnpike_628c.html" title="Massachusetts Turnpike">Massachusetts Turnpike</a>. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South campus buildings are apartments. All were originally constructed as commercial apartment buildings and later purchased by the University. Aside from the characteristic red plaques at their entrances, South Campus buildings are indistinguishable from the other private residences in the area. Since there are no central dining facilities in the South Campus area, students from these dormitories can dine at Warren Towers or other facilities on the main campus.</p>
<p><a name="10_Buick_Street"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: 10 Buick Street">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">10 Buick Street</span></h3>
<p>Boston University's newest residence and principle apartment-style housing area is officially called 10 Buick Street, a part of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html#John_Hancock_Student_Village" title="Boston University">John Hancock Student Village</a> project which includes the adjacent Fitness and Recreation Center and the <a href="../../../a/g/g/Agganis_Arena_a326.html" title="Agganis Arena">Agganis Arena</a>. Students most commonly refer to this residence as the "Student Village", or "StuV" (pronounced stoo-vee) for short. The apartments at 10 Buick Street are open to juniors and seniors only, and house more than 800 students in suite-style apartments. Each apartment has either two or four private bedrooms, one or two common bathrooms (one for doubles, two for quads), a common living room, and a common kitchen.</p>
<p>The building has two towers that are connected up to the ninth floor and rise separately to 18 floors in West Tower and 15 floors in East tower. The West Tower has apartments on floors 1-17, the 18th floor is the Student Atrium with stunning views of Boston and the Charles River. The East Tower has residences on floors 2-15, with the 1st floor being a marketplace. The 10 Buick Street Market and Cafe, open from 7 a.m. to midnight daily, has a soup &amp; salad bar, a small selection of household items, drinks and snacks, as well as sandwiches and bagels ready-to-order.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Director of the Student Village, Laura De Veau, began publishing a monthly newsletter for residents called "The Villager". In 2004, her successor, Brian Sirman, redesigned the publication to include recipes, a quiz, and "Ask Adrienne" (an advice column written by the Senior Resident Assistant, Adrienne Kisner). Since August 2004, The Villager has been printed bi-weekly. Ten Buick Street is the only on-campus residence at Boston University to feature a publication of this type.</p>
<p>In October, 2006, the school <a href="http://www.bu.edu/alumni/buforward/archives/oct_2006/articles/dorms.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bu.edu/alumni/buforward/archives/oct_2006/articles/dorms.html" rel="nofollow">announced plans</a> to break ground on a second residential high rise to be constructed behind Agganis Arena. Like the first building, the new high rise will feature two towers: a 26-story tower and a 19-story tower. The 26-story tower will consist of four-person and two-person apartments. A 19-story tower will consist of dormitory-style suites. Construction may begin as early as December, and the project is expected to be completed by 2009.</p>

<p>Located across the street from West Campus, 1019 is suite-style housing without kitchens. Thus, residents eat at the West Campus dining hall. The suites have three double rooms which share a bathroom and common room. During the summer, Boston University sometimes uses 1019 as temperory lodging for conference attendees and other visitors.</p>

<p>Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Avenue_8b86.html" title="Commonwealth Avenue">Commonwealth Avenue</a> between main school buildings, including 726-728 Commonwealth Avenue, located across from CVS on St. Mary's street.</p>

<p>Due to housing capacity shortages, many incoming students are temporarily housed in hotels during the fall semester. These hotels include the Hyatt Regency Cambridge on the opposite bank of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_River_5f89.html" title="Charles River">Charles</a>, and the Holiday Inn Brookline, both a manageable walk to main campus with free shuttle bus service provided to students in the Hyatt. Students at the Holiday Inn are provided with a complimentary <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority_d11d.html" title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority">MBTA</a> Subway pass, as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Line__C__Branch_2b9e.html" title="Green Line &quot;C&quot; Branch">Green Line C</a> passes nearby on Beacon Street. In both cases, students enjoy maid service twice a week, which is not present in standard housing assignments. Student residents at the Hyatt also receive a 50% discount on hotel food and merchandise. However, the cable service at the hotels has far fewer channels than typical service in BU dorms.</p>

<p>One of the hotels frequently used in this way was the former Howard Johnson hotel at <a href="../../../5/7/5/575_Commonwealth_Avenue_bd43.html" title="575 Commonwealth Avenue">575 Commonwealth Avenue</a>, next to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_School_of_Management_377a.html" title="Boston University School of Management">School of Management's</a> <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafik_Hariri_96ce.html" title="Rafik Hariri">Rafik Hariri</a> Building. In 2001, the University closed the hotel (which it owned) and converted the building into a full time dormitory, now known as 575 Commonwealth Avenue. Rooms are commonly divided into triples, although there are a few doubles and singles. Every room comes with its own bathroom and air conditioning, a luxury not present in most rooms on campus. Students lovingly refer to it as either 575 or the HoJo.</p>
<p>575 Commonwealth Avenue has its own cafe (located on the ground level) that is open nightly from 7pm-1am. Cafe 575 is also open Monday-Friday from 7:30-10:30am. Cash, Dining Points, and Convenience Points are accepted.</p>

<p>Boston University also provides specialty houses or specialty floors to students who have particular interests. La Maison Française (French), Das Deutsches Haus (German), La Casa Italiana (Italian), Русский Дом (Russian), and La Casa Española (Spanish), for example, house students who have an interest in the house's language. The Common Ground House on Bay State Road is a house designed for those wanting to live in an emphatically multi-background setting. Bay State Road also has brownstones for students in the University Professors program and Trustee Scholars. There are also specialty floors in large dormitories, such as pre-medical floors, education floors, same-sex floors, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Housing_System_0d61.html" title="Edit section: Security">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Security</span></h2>
<p>All large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and show their school identification before entering. Bay State Road brownstones and many of the apartment-style residences on South Campus (such as those on Park Drive and Buswell Street) do not have such security and require students to have keys to the front door instead. Every dormitory has at least one resident advisor. Large dorms have at least one on each floor.</p>
<p>The security system on campus (while safe and effective) is generally considered a nuisance by the student population. The rules and regulations of "swiping in" have caused a backlash on campus ever since they were implemented 17 years ago by then-president John Silber. Students (and residents) of Boston University cannot enter a dorm other than their own after 8 pm without being signed in, and are expected to leave the premises (unless allocated for a special study session, called a "study extension") by 2 am. Study extensions allow students who live on campus to stay in a dormitory not their own until 7am, at which time they must retrieve their card and, if they want, reenter the building following normal security procedures.</p>
<p>A dormitory resident must sign up the visitor before midnight for a "study extension", and must accompany the visitor when signing in, although the sign-in does not have to happen before midnight. Visitor passes, for those who do not live in BU housing, require 24 hour notice to the dorm's office and signatures from the parties involved (including 2 of the opposite sex if the visitor is not of the same sex as the host).</p>
