</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts_3b76.html" title="Commonwealth of Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> approved a charter for the incorporation of Boston College. John Bapst, SJ, was selected first president and presided over the opening of the school, the original grounds on Harrison Avenue in Boston's <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_End_7b6a.html" title="South End">South End</a>. For most of its early history, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its first entering class of 22 students ranged in age from 11 to 16 years. The curriculum was based on the traditional Jesuit <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratio_Studiorum_1747.html" title="Ratio Studiorum">Ratio Studiorum</a>, emphasizing <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>. While BC's mission, as articulated by founder John McElroy, SJ, was to "educate pupils in the principles and practice of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> faith," its founding documents reflect the historical realities of the time. The great influx of immigrants to Boston in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a> corresponded with growing anti-Catholic sentiment among the city's Brahmin elite. As a result, BC's charter was revolutionary for its time in stating that "the profession of religion will not be a necessary condition for admission to the College."</p>
<p>By the turn of the century, BC's enrollment had reached nearly 500. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased division between the high school and the college. The <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> purchase of farmland for a new college campus in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chestnut_Hill%2C_Massachusetts_75f8.html" title="Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts">Chestnut Hill</a> allowed BC High to fully expand into the South End buildings, though it remained a constituent part of Boston College until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> when it was separately <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorporation_%28business%29.html" title="Incorporation (business)">incorporated</a>. Nonetheless, traditional ties between BC High and BC have survived, and Boston College remains a leading destination for BC High graduates. Alumni who graduate from both institutions are called "<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_and_Triple_Eagles_9d77.html" title="Double and Triple Eagles">Double Eagles</a>" (with "Triple Eagles" going on to Boston College Law School).</p>

<p>Following the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, BC High was characterized by increasing enrollment and aging facilities. By the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940's</a>, the South End buildings proved inadequate once again. Overcrowding and a demand for athletic fields led President Robert A. Hewitt, SJ to purchase 70 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acres.html" title="Acres">acres</a> (280,000&#160;m²) on Columbia Point, in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, a move that was controversial at the time. At a cost of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>240,000, critics warned that BC High would be abandoning its city roots and moving to an undeveloped part of the city. But Father Hewitt had a vision, and he dreamed of "a modern high school with a full range of scholastic facilities, including <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratories.html" title="Laboratories">laboratories</a>, and a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a>; the necessary ecclesiastical facilities, including a Jesuit faculty residence and a church; a wide range of athletic facilities, including a gymnasium, field house, and outdoor areas for a variety of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a>, both interscholastic and intramural, and areas for general recreation, faculty walks, parking and campus <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landscaping.html" title="Landscaping">landscaping</a>."</p>
<p>Father Hewitt's dream began to see fruition in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, with the opening of McElroy Hall and the relocation of the junior and senior classes to the new campus. By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, the entire student body had moved to Columbia Point, though members of the Jesuit Community remained at the South End Residence until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>. In that year, <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyola.html" title="Loyola">Loyola</a> Hall, the new Jesuit residence, was completed. Successive building campaigns saw the opening of the Walsh Hall Science Center in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, the Student Training, Athletic and Recreation Complex (S.T.A.R.) in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Corcoran Library in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, and the multi-use McNeice Pavilion in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. William J. Kemeza is the current president of Boston College High School. A former principal and teacher at BC High, Kemeza is the first lay president in the school's history. He was the founder of BC High's Renaissance Campaign.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception still serves the Jesuit community of Boston as both an active center of worship and an administrative facility. The remaining school facilities have since been sold to other parties. The building immediately facing Harrison Avenue was renovated into a apartment complex by <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> reserved for the students of its nearby graduate health schools. Recent urban renewal and the influx of young professionals into the South End have led to the conversion of the other buildings into luxury condominiums.</p>

<p>BC High completed a 63,000 ft² (5,900&#160;m²) addition in the spring of 2005. The project included a new state-of-the-art science building, new administrative offices, a new cafeteria, and a general commons. Afterward, during the fall of 2005, President William J. Kemeza announced "Renaissance: The Campaign for Boston College High School," a US$40 million fundraising effort. The campaign has raised over US$30 million as of May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. As part of the campaign, the school underwent a US$12.5 million renovation project which included the renovation of the Cushing, Walsh and McElroy buildings. The Corcoran Library has also been updated with the addition of a "Great Books Room." Dever Theatre will soon be rebuilt into a 350 stadium-seat theatre by the end of the 06-07 year. The same US$12.6 million has also been used for an outdoor space with new entrance gates, a new road through campus, a second synthetic turf athletic field, and multi-purpose open spaces including plazas, athletic fields, and gardens.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
