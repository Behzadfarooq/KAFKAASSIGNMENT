	    <p>Some feedback about this: I grew up in Waltham and our accent was distinct from other cities in the area. It might be useful to have audio of natives' accents.--24.7.68.160 17:59, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is really interesting, but I suffer from a lack of X-SAMPA, and I'm not even sure if the characters are appearing correctly on my screen. So I want to second the suggestion to use sound, the most reliable representation of voice. 61.117.20.72 10:17, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ya the boston accent for example is different from the worcestor accent, and where i'm from, concord, has no discernible similarities to other towns nearby, most people can actually say "harwich" instead of "hahwich". One thing i thought was missing was the addition of an R after words ending in EA, most notably "idea" most everyone in massachussets says "i have an idear"</p>
<p>I definately say "idear", and I don't think this is due to "over-correction" like the article says. This is something done in British English as well. I tend to place r's on the end of open vowels at the end of words.</p>

<dd>Idear is very common around Boston. I live close to Boston and my family has lived here for generations. Those who have Boston accents often add an R to words that end in vowels - not all words, though. It is not "over-correction" - it is part of the Boston accent.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcinoe_9d8f.html" title="User:Alcinoe">Alcinoe</a> 08:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not to be a west coast dick, but could it be worth mentioning how irritating aspects (especially the nasal short-a) of this accent are to 'normal' american english speakers?</p>

<p>I'm from here, and I always thought "packee" was spelled "packy" and "statee" was spelled "statie". I don't know how widespread this is, but teenagers in the Metro Boston area sometimes refer to the act of using marihuana as "Getting Chiefed", with the word "Chiefed" pronounced "Chief" "ed", with the "ed" pronounced distinctly. This usage originates from the terms "joint" and "Joint Chiefs of Staff". --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 16:30, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>actaully getting chiefed was in reference to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Parish_372e.html" title="Robert Parish">Robert Parish</a>, The chief, being he was caught with large quainties of pot back in the early 90's --Kev62nesl 08:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I've never seen the word "statee" spelled, to be honest. It's so colloquial, it's rarely written apparently. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 23:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. I don't believe there are formal rules regarding spelling. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 17:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-The spelling is "statie," not "statee." Also, "townie" may in Boston itself refer to people from Charlestown, but outside it simply refers to any parochial person whose experience is primarily limited to his own town.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not from Boston, but a small town in MA, an hour away. Packee is short for Package Store. I've usually just heard the latter. "Pissa", I thought was spelt pisser and have heard it rhoticized sometimes. "Tonic" is strictly old fashioned and is now usually called "soda", which originated in NYC. I've heard dungarees and never connected it with Mass. "Wicked", amongst older generations, I'd say strictly New England. However, amongst people born after 1980, I'd say more universal. There are probably tons of phrases and words that are Mass, that I are part of my lexicon, but I am not aware that they are regional.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-Look, I'm 40 and I still use "tonic" now and then, so that's not really "old fashioned." "Out of style," maybe. Otherwise, I second the spelling of "pisser" - it's a non-rhoticized pronounciation of piss + -er.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I grew up in Brookline/Boston and I don't ever remember people saying "tonic", we always said "soda". --Thepdaswamie 00:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I grew up in Everett and we always used "tonic". It is the only Boston word that I had to prurposely remove from my lexicon since I often consult with soft drink manufacturers! There are still eating establishments north of Boston that list "tonic" (representing Pepsi, Coke, etc.) on their menus.Wspta 17:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-I grew up in Lowell and we also always use "tonic", not "soda."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-"Barrel" usually refers to a "trash can," not a "wastebasket" (though it is sometimes used of a "wastebasket," I think that's an expansion from its usually meaning). It is short for "garbage barrel."</dd>

<dd>I've lived in Boston since 1987, this was one of the first things I learned here -- after being teased mercilessly for saying "pop" for a soft drink -- and it's not terribly common anymore, but it is real, and not just at one or two places. It's more common south of Boston (Quincy, Brockton, etc.) as it's the standard in Rhose Island, but can be found up in New Hampshire too. A more complete explanation is in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milkshake.html" title="Milkshake">milkshake</a> article here, but there are plenty of non-Wikipedia references to it:

<dd>is there actually an arguement over what a milkshake is, it is milk mixed with vanilla sryup, no ice cream. I didnt think there was anything to dabate or argue over. Anyone from the regions knows this.--Kev62nesl 05:09, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No question. I'm just a teenager, so my dialect isn't probably traditional, but a milkshake is not a common drink. A frappe with ice cream is. I don't live near Boston though. I live near the cape. This is a huge distinction to make when addressing this dialect. Another biggie is "grinder".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my mind, a milkshake does not guarantee ice cream. It should be clearly a beverage (thin straw) as opposed to a frappe (thick straw or spoon). <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadlergo_8312.html" title="User:Ladlergo">Ladlergo</a> 05:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I grew up on the South Shore, and my family goes back a few generations here. Milkshake, ice cream soda, and frappe are three things that mean different things here than elsewhere, but all I know is that the one I want is a <i>frappe</i>. It's thick and ice-creamy and delicious, where a milkshake is more watered-down (due to the <i>milk</i>), and an ice cream soda is wicked watered-down (due to the soda water). Elsewhere in the country (and even here in Boston sometimes) a milkshake is more like the aforementioned McDonald's milkshake, meaning it's more like a frappe.</p>
<p>"I grew up in Boston, and have never heard of or seen anything without ice cream called a milkshake. Nor has anyone else from the area that I asked. The information was inaccurate, so I removed it." &lt;- You are quite wrong. Before national chains moved into the area a milkshake did not have ice cream but a frappe did.</p>

<p>As a native of Massachusetts who has lived in both the Western and Eastern parts of the state (and it really does make a difference), I've noticed that us Massholes tend to drop the letter "t" if it occurs in the middle of a word along with other consonants or at the end of a word. Instead, we use a glottal stop ('). In the case of double "t's", the "t" sound is closer to a "d". Examples: -Moun'ain (for "mountain") -Restraun' (for "restaurant") (However, "Worcester" is pronounced "Woosta.") -Boa' (for "boat") -Bai' (for "bait") -Beddah (for "better") -Mea' cuddah (for "meat cutter")</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't know enough about phonetics and the IPA to write about this. Nor have I done any real research into the topic, aside from observing my own pronunciation and that of those around me. However, if anyone else has noted this habit of pronunciation and knows more about it then I do, I would appreciate the addition of the information to this article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammar_nazi_ad14.html" title="User:Grammar nazi">Grammar nazi</a> 05:27, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know nothing of linguistics and phonology... I may be deceiving myself but after some years of living in the Boston area I am convinced that the "r" is not truly <i>missing</i> in the Boston accent, it is just <i>different.</i> (And, yes, subtle). A good example is the pronunciation of the town name "Arlington." I am not sure exactly what I am hearing, but something is going on. There <i>is</i> some kind of consonant-like-thing happening before the L. It is <i>not</i> pronounced "Ollington." Similarly, on close listening, I am convinced that "Harvard," while certainly not pronounced the way I would pronounce it, is <i>not</i> pronounced "Hahvahd." There are seven phonemes pronounced, not five.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that when the syllable "ar" is pronounced, there is no real consonant, but the vowel is pronounced as a diphthong. The problem for me is that I can simultaneously perceive that there are two different sounds, and yet both of these sounds to me are perceived as the same "ah" phoneme.</p>
<p>I'll bet that native Boston-accent speakers perceive themselves to be enunciating an "r" and I'll bet they hear an "r." This is certainly true of the few that I've asked.</p>
<p>Lady Mondegreene department: a friend of mine mentioned misperceiving something said by a native Boston-accent speaker. The speaker was a Dr. Armington, who I met on a couple of occasions, and he pronounced his own name much the same way as the Ar- in the name of the town of Arlington. My friend said that Dr. Armington had, on a couple of occasions, used the phrase "a nominal egg" to mean "the price of something expensive." He finally asked about the meaning of this quaint New England expression, since an egg didn't seem like a good exemplar of luxury. It turned out that Armington had been saying that something cost "an arm and a leg." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this page very interesting! I might also add that this accent can also be found in (or is very similar to) much of Rhode Island, and eastern Connecticut (in addition to the already mentioned eastern Massachussetts, New Hampshire, and Maine). Since I'm not a linguist, I dare not attempt to change the page on my own. But basically anyone from east of the Connecticut River shares some traits of the Boston accent. It's just food for thought.

<p>I take issue with the note at the end of the first paragraph stating that the best-known user of the Boston accent was JFK. NOBODY in Boston has that accent except his brother Teddy. Nobody. Come to Boston and you'll never hear this peculiar accent.</p>
<p>I'd also like to note that, although to the outside world all the accents from Maine to Connecticut form the larger Boston-y accent, there is a gigantic difference in accent in different areas. For example, I grew up on the South Shore, where most people speak very low in their vocal range (think words like "cahnt" for can't) and with more of a Brooklyn-like punchiness than on the North Shore, where the voice is much breathier and words are spoken much more quickly (Think PEE-biddy for Peabody). Despite the Big Dig's connecting us all together like never before, these differences seem to persist.</p>

<dd>Hailing from North-Eastern Connecticut and having very heavy experience in Mass, Rhode Island, and Southern CT, I can say for a fact that Connecticut is for the most part "Standard American" in its accent, with a few MA and RI influenced folks here and there. Maine and Vermont, however, have quite a large "accented" population. That said, you're completely right, no one has an accent like the Kennedys. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaikoten_4860.html" title="User:Shaikoten">Shaikoten</a> 16:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, with Quimby. The Simpsons writers were not from New England. They, like Trey Parker and Matt Stone on South Park during Cartoon Wars, confuse the dialect with New York.

<p>I moved as an early teen to the Boston are(r) in the early 1970s. It was like moving to a different country. There were all these new words, like wicked, pissah. <i>Many</i> people talked like the Kennedys. That was nahmal. (The accents of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Damon_698e.html" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Affleck_9dc7.html" title="Ben Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> in <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Will_Hunting_60bc.html" title="Good Will Hunting">Good Will Hunting</a> give you a sense of this.</i> <b>Softening of Boston accent</b> With time, the Boston accent has softened. This has happened with the influence of television. Television provides a national standard. Children spend many hours listening to it. Aside from their parents, television is an important factor in shaping children's speech. Cumulatively, more generations have become influenced by standard American speech, and less influenced by Boston speech. Furthermore, local television stations have influenced this by employing newscasters with Standard American accents, rather than with Bostonian speech. Actually, Senators <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kerry_7a56.html" title="John F. Kerry">John F. Kerry</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_M._Kennedy_845e.html" title="Edward M. Kennedy">Edward M. Kennedy</a> had stronger accents in the 1970s. When one hears recordings of their speeches from that period their accents are more pronounced.</p>
<p>For many people there was the notion that having the Boston accent was low class. These speakers have shed or never adopted the accent. Additionally, the colleges of Boston and Cambridge have attracted migrants from other pahts of the U.S. Many of these migrants have stayed and have influenced the mannah of speech in the Boston area(r).</p>
<p>So, we now have the softened Boston accent. It is too bad that aside from the Kennedys we have few easily accessible recohdings of standid Bahston speech in the 1960s. <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogru144_d5a8.html" title="User:Dogru144">Dogru144</a> 14:39, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is interesting how you can actually hear the transition from British English to American English within the Boston accent - like in certain features throughout the East Coast. Think about how an Englishman says 'got' and how an average American says it. The former pronounces it almost like 'goat', while with the latter it is more like 'gat'. Both of these sounds are contained in the word when a Bostonian says it.</p>
<p>Also, Bostonians often pronounce the H in words like "herb" while the rest of the US does not.</p>

<p>The recent edit says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Traditional maps have marked most of the territory east of the Connecticut river as non-rhotic, but this is highly innacurate of contemporary speakers. The University of Pennsylvania's Telsur map shows non-rhoticity as only occuring with any significant frequency in Eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Southeastern New Hampshire, Southeastern Connecticut, and Coastal Maine.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, Penn's Telsur project only interviewed speakers from major cities. In other words, Eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Southeastern New Hampshire, Southeastern Connecticut, and Coastal Maine are <i>all</i> the areas east of the Connecticut River for which Telsur has any data at all. Thus this is in no wise inconsistent with "most of the territory east of the Connecticut River" being non-rhotic—in fact, it supports it. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 21:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Boston is not considered "Southeastern New England" which is usually used to describe areas south of Boston. The Boston accent is common to areas to the North and South of Boston and in Boston itself. The accent is very similar in areas of southern Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. A very different accent is heard in central and western Massachusetts. I don't really know how to define the area perfectly, because there is a gradual shift in the accent. In Portland, Maine, one can hear something very similar to a Boston accent, with differences such as "ayup" instead of "yup," for example. It is hard to tell where the Boston accent ends and the Maine accent begins. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcinoe_9d8f.html" title="User:Alcinoe">Alcinoe</a> 11:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I live in Northern Ireland and I just wanted to point out that I recognise some of the words and phrases which are listed under Boston slang. For example: "blinker" to mean a car indicator light, "mint" for good, and "says" in place of said. I also notice a parallel between the stated use of the word "wicked", as in very, and what some rural dwellers in Ulster say - wild, ie "That car was going wild fast!" Less common in these parts is the use of "hey" to end a question or statement - "What time are you going home, hey?". In this case, it is peculiar to Ballymena and "hey" is pronounced "hi." I wonder then if the Boston dialect is just a descendent of the language used by the many Irish settlers who left these shores to make their home in New England. I'm not a linguist by any means, but has anyone else got any ideas? Paddyman1989 00:33, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
