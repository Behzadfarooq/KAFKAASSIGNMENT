<p>Hey guys, the 2005 population estimate , listed as 559,034, is wrong. The Census admitted that it made a mistake and corrected it to 596,638.

<dd>Because the vast majority of users looking up "Boston" are probably looking for Boston, Massachusetts, a redirect to Boston, Massachusetts seems to provide the most clarity and ease of use, regardless of chronology, city size, and historical significance. Further, after the disambiguation page was restructured to be more neutral to the UK, Boston, Massachusetts is hidden beneath two other Bostons, making the process slightly confusing for those who are interested in looking up the most common use of Boston. It is clear, further, that using the language "most commonly refers to" in the disambiguation page is considered inadequate (even offensive) by many editors from the United Kingdom. However, when there are two common usages with one clearly more prominent than the other, there is precedent for taking the second most common usage and placing a separate link to it at the top of the article so the user does not need to wade through the disambiguation page for either usage (see <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> as an example - which, by the way, demonstrates that this is not a matter of US-centricism). I would not be at all opposed to adding a link to Boston, Lincolnshire at the top using the entry for Cambridge as a model. Is that an adequate compromise? Moldybagel 22:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Some of us are concerned with the apparent growing popularity of "niche naming" within Wikipedia, where every niche of articles follows some naming convention for ALL articles in that niche, not just those requiring disambiguation, resulting in willy-nilly naming all over Wikipedia, and fewer and fewer articles named with the name most commonly used to reference the subject of each article. Whether that's a concern for you or not is fine, but please respect that others are concerned about this, and that it's a legitimate concern.

<li>I wholeheartedly agree that other users concerns should be respected and there has been a lot of good faith efforts on the convention page to air those concerns and work for consensus on a solution. Unfortunately, to this point, those arguments haven't been convincing enough to achieve consensus support. So rather then continue working for consensus, why step out to nominate a page move using the same failed arguments that is bound to fail again? That is counterproductive and while it is easy to respect the <i>view</i>, its hard to respect disruptive <i>actions</i>. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 19:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Correct. What benefit does this have to the project? Especially when there is clearly not consensus for this type of page moves over at the convention page. The <b>exact same</b> arguments in support of this page move have been soundly rejected for lack of consensus over on the convention page. So why recycle and rehash them here? The <a href="../../../p/o/i/Wp%7Epoint.html" title="Wp:point">point</a> issues comes into play because the nominator has clearly been a part of the convention page discussion and should be aware of the lack of consensus there, yet he comes here to nominate a page move anyways? To do what? To stir up the "troops" on both sides and create more bitterness and discontent? To distract from focusing on the convention page and try to find some consensus. That seems counterproductive and borderline disruptive. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 19:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The benefit you asked about is: increased clarity, by having the article at a simple name, when there is no need for it to be named anything else. There is a reasonable expectation that it might be moved, due to several other examples such as Chicago and Philadelphia.

<dd>Again, that argument has been roundly rejected and pointed out that there is no increase clarity and in fact it goes counter to naming conventions like <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28P%29_9f7e.html" title="WP:NC(P)">WP:NC(P)</a> which favors the most clear name. If you couldn't make this argument fly on the naming convention, what point is there to try on a page move? The "reasonable expections" you mentioned happened during a time when, unfortunately, not a lot of editors were aware of the naming convention issues. Do you honestly think they would succeed if proposed today? I tell you, if you are that confident then lets move the pages <i>back</i> to their original titles and try the page move. If they succeed, then from here on out you will never hear an objection from me about the City page move.

Obviously, there is strong sentiment that have these non-exceptional cases as "exceptions" is a determinant to the project and adds unnecessary confusion for the reader and editor. Or the ambiguous <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia_9a31.html" title="Vancouver, British Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a> for that matter.

<li><b>Oppose'</b> <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> redirects here so there is no problem with users having to type in a long title. There are at least eight other municipalities that use the name. Boston, MA wasn't even the first. Wikipedia policies are hammered out so that when there are cases that could be legitimately argued either way, we don't have a donnybrook on every article and end up with inconsistant usage.

<li>The world famous city in Massachusetts is unquestionably the dominant usage of the name <b>Boston</b> in the English speaking world. To disambiguate it using the comma convention implies incorrectly that it is not the dominant usage. That is the justification for making an exception here. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 17:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The city comma state convention is widely used in the U.S. going back centuries. It reflects the fact that the 50 states are sovereign entities that control the names used by their citys and towns but not the names used in neighboring states. Use of Boston, Massachusetts as an article title no more implies anything about the prominance of Boston than using <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwartzenegger_50be.html" title="Arnold Schwartzenegger">Arnold Schwartzenegger</a> as a title implies there are other, more prominant Schwartzeneggers.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 19:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly! Disambiguation issues aside, there is a sense of identity and history that is tied into the comma convention. Unlike the silly argument that adding the state will "confuse" the reader as to what the <i>city name</i> will be, the Comma convention most accurately convey the name of the <i>place</i> which is what the article is about. In US history cities were never considered sovereign entities and have always been commonly associated with their state. It is a disservice and inaccuracy to the Encyclopedia to name US cities differently. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 19:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>With all due respect, Arthur, that's a different argument that ignores my rebuttal to your first argument. As to your second argument, the fact that the states are sovereign in the United States and control the names within them is true enough, but why is that information appropriate to be conveyed via the title, at the cost of <i>not</i> conveying the much more arguably appropriate information: what the most common name of the subject for the given article is, and whether it's the only usage, or unquestionably the dominant usage, of that name? That is information that is conveyed by the vast majority of articles in Wikipedia, including most city articles. Why should U.S. cities in particular be an exception to this? Because of this state sovereignity thing? What does that have to do with conveying the most common name of the city, and whether or not there are other common uses of the name? As to the <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzennegger_37d4.html" title="Arnold Schwarzennegger">Arnold Schwarzennegger</a> point, you make mine: While Arnold and Schwarzennegger are common ways to refer to the man, the <i>most</i> common way he is referred to is by his full name: <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzennegger_37d4.html" title="Arnold Schwarzennegger">Arnold Schwarzennegger</a>. For people who are more commonly known by first name only, like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna (entertainer)</a>, they are not at their full name.

<li>The reason US cities should be treated differently is that usage in the US for city names is different. Cher and Madonna have adopted stage names with no surname.

And saying that there shouldn't be any more page move request is not the answer either since there is clearly a problem with the current convention. But this, right now, is completely pointless. What both sides need to agree on is to seek mediation and input by people <b>who has never commented on this and took sides</b> (i.e. objective). For the sake of the project, please consider it.

<p>I am requesting that an edit be made to the first lines in the history/intro section of this award winning article. The Puritans of Massachusetts Bay who founded Boston in 1630 were not "known as the Pilgrim fathers." This should be deleted.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims founded Plymouth Colony and had a separate history and religious platform from the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Pilgrims departed by sea for the New World from Leiden, Holland not England. Leiden was their temporary home for 12 years (1608-1620) after having fled persecution in England. The Pilgrims landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620 on the Mayflower, ten years before the Puritans. The Puritans came direct from England to Boston.</p>
<p>The two colonies were separate and did not merge until 1691, 71 years after the founding of the Plymouth Colony. When the Massachusetts Bay Colony was reorganized and issued a new charter as the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, Plymouth ended its history as a separate colony and merged into the new province. The most obvious difference between the Pilgrims and the Puritans is that the Puritans had no intention of breaking with the Church of England - only to "purify" it. The Pilgrims were separatists who considered the established church in England to be corrupt and non-reformable. The two groups did eventually unite into one faith community but by then they were no longer Pilgrims and Puritans but had evolved into New England <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregationalists.html" title="Congregationalists">Congregationalists</a>.

<p>The demographics section has been edited heavily lately, I have a couple issues with recent changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unlike all other cities, it uses 2006 estimates rather than 2000 data. Also, no citations to it, which is its own problem.</li>
<li>We have this whole note about commuters bringing up the effective daily population, and how this would make Boston "within" the top 10. First, no source on this. Second, does this add commuter populations to all other cities in that comparison? Third, can we be more useful than "within" the top 10?</li>

<p>This article states that Boston was founded on November 17, 1630. The correct date is September 7, 1630. The only references I see to the November 17, 1630 are websites that copy Wikipedia data.

<p>Aside from the clear cut BS and Bostonians delusions of grandeur, please tell me what part of CT is in the Boston metro area? I would like to know. You guys in Philly, as well as Boston (I feel that you two have something in common, historically) need your own Identities. Philly needs to stop trying to put itself in with NYC just because it (Philly) is near NJ. NYC already has it's NY/NJ/CT region. Similarly, Boston needs to stop trying to force CT into it's New England region headed (self appointed of course) by itself. CT is not what you would like it to be. All of you stores (with Boston sports propaganda in them) cannot take it away from NYC. You two cities need to get a life and stop trying to leech off of cities that have nothing to do with you.--<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.235.81.39.html" title="User:71.235.81.39">71.235.81.39</a> 03:52, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are quite right. I assumed that Connecticut was included as part of some Census designated place like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Boston_e4c4.html" title="Greater Boston">Greater Boston</a> or its <a href="../../../m/s/a/MSA_bb08.html" title="MSA">MSA</a>, but I checked and no formally recognized definition of Greater Boston or anything of the sort groups Connecticut in there.

<dd>Actually, it is quite clear if you know your history. Prior to the 2000 Census, the Office of Management and Budget defined MSAs in New England on a town-by-town basis (similarly to what are now called <a href="../../../n/e/c/NECTA_b8e0.html" title="NECTA">NECTAs</a> and Combined NECTAs). The Worcester, MA-CT PMSA included the town of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thompson%2C_Connecticut_2015.html" title="Thompson, Connecticut">Thompson, Connecticut</a>, and thus it was also included in the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT CMSA <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/99mfips.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/99mfips.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Today, the county-based Boston-Worcester-Manchester, MA-RI-NH Combined Statistical Area does not include Connecticut, but the Worcester, MA-CT Metropolitan NECTA includes <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putnam%2C_Connecticut_5936.html" title="Putnam, Connecticut">Putnam</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodstock%2C_Connecticut_d391.html" title="Woodstock, Connecticut">Woodstock</a> in addition to Thompson. (I can't find the CNECTA definitions, but I would expect that there's a Boston-Worcester-Lawrence CNECTA.) The Boston TV market historically included one Connecticut county; I'm not sure if it still does. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 17:01, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I am glad that a sound editor is a work here. Boston does not have the reach that New Englanders would like to believe. It is not that large of a city. It is only the last major city in the US before Canada and it is all alone up there. The last time I checked TV markets, no piece of CT is in there TV market and there is no New England TV market. Boston keeps trying to use the New England thing to mean Boston and expand it's market share to make themselves appear more of a major TV market in the US. We in CT are proudly in the NYC area.--<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.235.81.39.html" title="User:71.235.81.39">71.235.81.39</a> 18:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless of how <i>you</i> feel about it, you can't speak for the whole state. <a href="http://www.simonpure.com/between.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.simonpure.com/between.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s an interesting look into Connecticut state identity from a documentary called <i>Between Boston &amp; New York</i>. Particularly the section on page 5 that starts at <b>Regionalism</b> where the documentary recognize that sports loyalties, politics, and other facts of life split the feelings of CTers between New York and Boston and their own desire to be identified separate from both in some cases. Personally, I know people who live in Greenwich who think of it as part of NYC and I know people who live in Pomfret who'd chop off the lower left corner of the state just to keep the whole place more "New England-y". But then again, it doesn't matter what I personally find to be the case either. But I did find this documentary and it does describe exactly what I've experienced. Some of CT think NYC, some of CT think Boston, you can listen to WFAN while watching NESN, your taxes are paid to Hartford but your income comes from Providence, you spend more hours in your car on the GWB than you do crossing the covered bridge to get into your community at home. Interesting place, but to swear off either NYC <b>or</b> Boston as not having any influence on the state as a whole entity is only arguing with your heart and not your brain. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:56, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Gosh, when I was in CT (Hartford and points north and east), Boston stations were available on cable, you could get home delivery for the Globe, and Hartford Whalers' games were nearly half Black-and-Gold.

<p>I am from Rocky Hill and grew up in danbury, and have always considered myself a New Englander, and a part of the Boston area, so I agree, please do not try and speak for the whole state. For some in Fairfield County, you may share this POV, but do not speak on behalf of the entire state. youd have a better argument against boston area if you were to say the hartford/springfield area, as bradley international airport serves. and i am also on the west of the river and have always been, so even that doesn't work.Kmccusker2 06:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Lol! It may be closer to Logan (Hartford has it's own airport), but Logan is still a good way away from Boston. However, Hartford is not in the NYC area. Since they are crazy about Springfield, MA and call themselves the "shining start of New England," that pretty much sums up what they feel that they must be. Down in the NY area parts of the state, the only thing New England are some Boston/MA owned businesses who seem to want to promote Boston sports teams or call themselves "New England" something. They put emphasis on the "New England." It's a dead give away. I have never seen a city so far away try so hard to capture the minds of a state that has nothing at all to do with them. In spite of all of their efforts, they cannot change the culture. Ask anyone in the world, "New York or Boston?" You know Boston is not even in the running. Boston is not even world class. The question is "New York or Los Angeles?" Boston needs to deal with it's own region and forget about trying to brainwash CT citizen's.--71.235.81.39</p>

<dd>As much as I personally have a political and cultural axe to grind with Boston, I have to agree with the others here, 71.235.81.39. You are not conducting your part of conversation in a fashion appropriate to open, academic discourse. Please refrain from making wild, unsubstantiated claims that something is factual. For instance, "world class" is a subjective, non-neutral statement and therefore inappropriate to the discussion.</dd>
<dd>On another front, I think it would be interesting to identify the different pseudo-cultural areas in the U.S., though this is beyond the scope of Wikipedia. After all, southwestern CT does appear to display NYC leanings, while the northern parts seem to link to the Berkshires, Springfield, and Worcester, respectively. I'm not sure about the south central and southeastern parts of the state, but it would be interesting to see someone do such a study. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunkelza_5db9.html" title="User:Dunkelza">Dunkelza</a> 13:39, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's been done, both on linguistic and cultural scales. Fairfield and New Haven Counties are definitely satellites of NYC, while you're correct in the premise that everywhere else is a part of New England; New Haven, Bristol and points northwest are border towns, more or less. Beyond that, heaven knows the basis for 71.235.81.39's evident hatred of Boston, but I agree it's inappropriate for Wikipedia in general and this article in particular. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:22, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the south central part is NYC too. You forget that they are on the Metro-North line and Boston is still light years away. They just do not have anything in common with a city that has no influence or proximity to them. For those who do, I may assume it is because they border MA and that must be good enough for them. Southeastern CT is very odd. I used to assume that they were into Boston and NOT NYC. When I was coming back from RI(I keep forgetting that another cultural divide is that these Boston related peoples sound alike and NOT as we do in CT), I was in a town (North Stonington) near the RI border. I went into a gas station and they sold NY newpapers as well as Boston. They also sol Yankees and Red Sox gear. Now I will say that the Red Sox gear would not be too shocking, but I was shocked to see Yankees. So I guess the SE part of the state may deal with both.</p>
<p>FOr the most part, if you live in the parts of the state where you pick up NYC or Long Island TV or radio stations, you know that you are in the NYC area. Even in any part of CT, I have not been able to pick up any Boston media because it is not possible since no part of CT is in the Boston area. We don't even get Boston newspapers down here except in those specialty newsstands. I hope that settles this. I just think that people from Boston and New England spent too much time assuming and thinking that CT felt the same way as they do about Boston/New England that it comes as a shock to you. Well this is the way it is.--<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.235.81.39.html" title="User:71.235.81.39">71.235.81.39</a> 15:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
