<dd>Hi BostonMA! You still here?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na&amp;curid=2285233&amp;diff=94629756&amp;oldid=94587083#Nice_Catch" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na&amp;curid=2285233&amp;diff=94629756&amp;oldid=94587083#Nice_Catch" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I want to send you a Barnstar for being such an all around great person but I looked at the Barnstar collection and none of them seem good enough for you!

<dd>I am requesting, although of course you are a free person to do as you like, that you not feed into the Starwood thing anymore, per Katherine and others such as Salix alba. It just feeds the farce and keeps their show on the road. (My opinion and what ever you do will not change my opinion of you.)

<dd>Thanks for removing that!

Should not anyone who is worried about such mention on a talk page be more worried about that? Need to find a huge Barnstar for you!

<dl>
<dd>P.S. Also he stalked me to the mediator's page and called me a sockpuppet again. You probably already saw that. It will be interesting to see how the mediator handles all this, as my view is that he underestimates what is going on. (So glad you are back!)

<dd>Actually I don't think I have been named and I don't intend to get involved if possible -- of course usually I get dragged into these things because everything Starwood is all my fault. (Glad to see your Purple Star -- definitely deserved!) Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 23:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, now I see I am added. I don't have anything to say in arbitration and intend to stay out of it if possible. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 23:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is there to arbitrate if he withdraws? The Starwood thing would not be an issue if he and 999 did not harass. Rosencomet himself has just been enabled and condoned by all this circular mediating and allowance of windbag stuff. To me he is the least of the problem. He by himself could never have pulled it off. As for me, what am I arbitrating? I'm sick of the whole thing. If it means the end of my harassment I'd be interested. But most likely it is just another chance for everyone to drag me through the mud and take up my time when I could be doing edits. In fact there is already a message on his page from an arbitration person asking for more information about me. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 00:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now he is leaving Wikipedia. Didn't he just do that a few weeks ago over the sockpuppet report you filed? This is all a joke! How can all this be taken seriously! Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 00:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He needs to do it offically, like Ars Scriptor did, or this is just a farce. It's like that Starwood mediator going overboard worrying about scaring him off. It's all the worse for me.

<dd>That's exactly what I'm trying to do, leave officially, if BostonMASS would stop interfering. I hope this gets brought up when he tries to become an admin, You do not interfere with such things when you are involved in a dispute with another user. Even an admin would ask another admin to do it. It's wrong —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 00:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are clearly trying to pre-empt the mediation when you eliminate an internal link to the Starwood page because YOU have decided that Starwood isn't important enough to merit a link. By 1999 Big Brother was doing rib burn-offs and other such venues; Starwood was one of the more prestigious appearances of the late 90s, and they cut their fee to get it. They had just released their second album in 25 years. They were not at all one of the most expensive groups Starwood had hosted, but they were well known and offered a good, well-received performance. Halley DeVestern has her own article, not created by me, and I thought it would be nice to link her name to her Starwood pictures on a NON-STARWOOD website. I did NOT add a link to the Starwood website, and the internal link PRE-DATED the mediation. In terms of gigs, cost of performance, recent recordings, record sales, collaborations, and a whole lot more measures of notability they are NOT so big or popular that a mention of an appearance at Starwood is trivial. Today they play mostly clubs, hotels and casinos, and haven't had a CD out since 1998. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 22:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The mediation includes discussion of whether mention of starwood is appropriate in given articles. The link that you added on Dec 11 increased the presense of starwood on that page. You did not discuss this link in mediation prior to adding it. If you are going to make such edits, then your complaints about "trying to pre-empt the mediation" are going to fall on deaf ears. Since there is a mediation page, please do not discuss on my talk page. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 22:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Hi Che, I hope that you are feeling well and that your tests have been going well. I am writing to report to you news of the Starwood mediation. Things seem to have broken down to the point that a request for arbitration has been filed. This puts a question mark over the mediation. (I don't think that it necessarily rules out mediation, because it is still an open question of whether the arbitration committee will hear the case). On the other hand, from your point of view, you may decide that mediation is over. In any event, I wanted to thank you for your efforts, and to say that I'm sorry that we were not able (at least for now) to present you with a successful case in which the parties learned to see eye-to-eye. Please let me know what you think of all this if you get a chance and feel the energy to do so. Sincerely, --BostonMA talk 23:13, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Thanks for notifying me about this. I'm actually currently involved in <i>another</i> arbitration case, as a <i>prior</i> mediator ... I really know how to pick 'em, huh? I don't necessarily expect that Arbitration in this case will solve the issues in this case, and I cautiously expect that the case will not be accepted.

<p><i>Still, even if the request is turned down, that too will provide additional grist for the mediation.</i> How so? I would be concerned that one side might interpret a rejection of the arbcom case as a vindication and as a show of support for their side. --BostonMA talk 02:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, perhaps I'm putting on a happy face for this. You're right about how rejection might be interpreted by the factions. However, the process of <i>submitting</i> the RFAR has certainly crystallized some of my opinions around the issue. Because of this, I'm clearer about what I think is congruent with WP policy. While I don't think it will make me intractable or incapable of compromise, it has made me aware of being too easygoing in cases where I believe WP policy and guidelines are being deliberately broken or manipulated. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b>Pigman</b></a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Pigman_6033.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Pigman">contribs</a>) 03:26, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just read your pontificating post. (I have a hard time finding posts on my page often and didn't see the longer part until now.) I think you misunderstood me. I am saying yes, in interactions treat others "as if" they are acting in good faith which much (or most) of the time they are, unless clear evidence otherwise. But keep a bigger picture in your mind and allow for possibilities. I need not go through my list of grievances where that did not occur again!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the other, yes the scale is different but growing. Personal use of Wikipedia also can be for other than purely financial gain, such as to promote political or religious beliefs. As far as policy goes, to me there is not so much difference between the two situations. Gangs of editors are covertly supporting each other over investments (of whatever kind) in batches of articles and controlling them. Maybe the second group is more polite. But I thought they were independent, unbiased editors and now it turns out that is not the case at all. In fact, in some ways it is worse. One offender is clearly a promotor and although his supporters' motivations are not clear their behavior certainly is up front. The other gives the impression of neutrality but when you own a website in common that promotes a point of view (whether for financial or other motivations), then write articles on the point of view here and insert links to your web site (even without the selling of the book)? (It happens frequently in so-called psychological articles, not with the organised tag teams though so the organised suites of articles don't develop}. I find it very troubling. But if you can convince me otherwise, please do. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 16:38, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I consider imposing a POV as harmful to the project. I'm not sure how familiar you are with this user's previous contributions to this article with respect to this, but, there may be some indication in what's remaining of the archives. He has misleaded many people regarding certain 'facts' when it comes to incidents in Wikipedia in general, let alone here - one of which I will be reporting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main article being Sama Veda has been established for quite a long time, and his lack of discussion in removing this important part of the section of the article, is vandalism. There is no 'experimenting' about it. The major part of his POV was when he put a linguistic tint in his addition of "Tamil literature" in this same section, which was discussed (with this user) at an earlier date. I expect also this would be in the archives. I've replaced the warnings, as I'm still not convinced by what you've said. <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 01:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your response. I agree that imposing a POV into an article is harmful to the project. However, vandalism is not merely edits which are harmful to the project, but are edits that are <b>intended</b> to harm the project. I have no reason to disbelieve that <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">User:Venu62</a> believes he is helping. This makes it a content dispute and not vandalism.

<p>So let me get this straight, hypothetically, if you believe getting drunk, bashing your wife, vandalising the neighbourhood etc. will help your family, then it makes it totally ok and no warnings should be given to you about the harm you are causing? It's totally ok if you get away with it (again and again) without even some sort of warning because you had <b>best intentions</b>? And then when you're warned, you don't even try fix yourself up and continue going ahead as you please, then it's still totally ok? Answer: no. While those circumstances may be different, the principle applies in the same way in both. One can assume good faith on the first or even the second time. After that, if there's a stubbornness to NOT even try to figure out what you're doing wrong and fix it up, then it's unreasonable. Anyway, I've reported the user. I'm not wasting time on him further. <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 02:07, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry that I was unable to explain the situation in a way that persuades you. I don't believe that making edits, even bad edits, is at all comparable to violence against individuals. Bad edits are easily undone. The harm of violence is not. Further, one who beats his wife is intending harm. However, at this point, I feel the need to mention that "continuing to go ahead as you please" seems to apply to your edits as well as the those of the user with whom you are in a content dispute. I again suggest that you should try some of the methods described in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a>, such as an article RfC. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 02:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your argument "Bad edits are easily undone. The harm of violence is not." is fairly weak, in that, it still misses the point that they're both "bad" (as you call it) - the issue was never whether the harm could be undone or not. They both deserve a warning. Simple. This is where you lack persuasion.</p>
<p>On another note again, I will remind you that you may lack experience with respect to this user's contributions to this article, however, as I told a blocked user, "I, or anyone else, will no longer tolerate POV pushing so that this article may be wrecked" [a few days/weeks back I think] when clear attempts are being made to neutralise what exists - we want to be able to reassess this article without "bad" or "unreasonable edits" (in the words he has used against others in this very article). Further, I would imagine that one who checks the discussion page so frequently would not be disabled from merely making a new post and proposing the new change (yet he demands others to do it for him). <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 09:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps, <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">User:Venu62</a> needs to propose new changes on the discussion page when it isn't accepted (as he has been advised countless times in the past, and hypocritically, he has advised others of the same). Also, very usually, reasons are given when they are removed. If he is incapable of (at the very least) trying to fix it up accordingly in the talk page as a draft, then he really needs to stop crying wolf. There are issues with his version of 'fairness' and 'neutrality', and some other users think so too. While I can agree that no one is perfect (we are human), if he puts no effort to try see what's wrong or try resolve those alleged issues, then he has no excuse, and deserves no sympathy.

<dd>Hi, Thanks for trying to mediate between Ncmvocalist and myself. I appreciate it, and am ready to apologise for any pain caused. My intentions are not to cause disruptions to any article or editor. However my notices may have been due to my frustration with certain editors who deliberately (IMO) remove relevant and neutral information from the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic music</a> article which are backed by valid citations, while refusing to answer my specific questions regarding this in the article Talk page. My question was simply this: Why is it irrelevant to mention one of the oldest surviving Tamil epics which contain detailed information on the ancient music, while it is ok to mention Sama Veda and the Sanskrit epics? Isn't this POV?

<p>I've replaced the warning on User: Venu62's page due to the fact he has been warned not once, but several times regarding his behaviour on this article talk page, as well as others. This is his final warning to clean his behaviour up, on articles + their respective talk pages. Saying someone made a personal attack when they didn't is in itself considered a personal attack, so he really only has one final chance. (The fact he starts his reply in an article talk page with the words "personal attack", "incivility" shows a lack of initiative, so why he's surprised by a suggestion and why he imagines a personal attack is beyond me.) The claim of incivility is ridiculous, considering, my reply merely repeated the words of the user. I didn't believe it was incivil, but as he himself considers it incivil, an extra warning has been placed on his page. Any further issues regarding this user's behaviour will not be tolerated. If it is too frustrating, then Wikipedia is not the place to be - Wikipedians are expected to keep a cool head at all times, and indefinitely, in articles+their talk pages. <a href="../../../n/c/m/User%7ENcmvocalist_3811.html" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> 23:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

But keep in mind, the sites you focus to, are personal and the sources I cited is from University papers which are considered more valid in wiki. Also see the large amount of inline citations in the bothe sections you tagged NPOV.

<p>In the case you did file for harassment, then the outcome would be no different to a complaint that was filed against Venu62 for similar reasons, a few months back, by an ex-user. This is just FYI. I'd hate to think of the consequences to a user if he/she made a threat that didn't have enough weight.&#160;:)</p>
<p>On another note, you are under no circumstances in a position to insist I check with an admin before placing warnings.

<dd>Hi Jefferson Anderson, I see that you posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jeff_Rosenbaum&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95804119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jeff_Rosenbaum&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95804119" rel="nofollow">a comment that accuses me of bad faith</a>.

In general at Wikipedia you should not accuse someone of acting in bad faith unless it is an obvious case of vandalism. It also is usually not a good idea to remove someone's comments. I am pretty thick skinned, so I haven't taken offense. However, I'm curious to know why you believe my comment was in bad faith?

<p>Because you are clearly trying to discredit my opinion. My account is not single purpose, and it preexisted the nomination. I've "voted" in other AfD and understand the process. Please remove your comment, it's immaterial that this account dates, from Dec. 4. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 22:18, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your response. I did not claim that your account was a single purpose account. I also mentioned the date of your first edit which is clearly prior to the nomination. As for "clearly" trying to discredit your opinion, I suppose you could see it that way. I do think the opinions of editors who have a bit more experience than you ought to be given greater weight. However, that does not mean that I think your opinion is invalid. You will notice that I have not (yet) voted in this article for deletion (and may not). At the moment, I am not convinced one way or the other whether the subject of the article is sufficiently notable to deserve an article. A final point. Your deletion of comments etc. on the AfD page does not help your case, but hurts it. AfD is not a vote but a discussion, and you would help your cause much more by making some arguments, rather than saying (in effect) "me too".

<dd>PPS. I did not delete any comments, I moved them to the talk page - where in my opinion they belongs. How come your opinion is always right and everybody else's always wrong? Are you sure that pointing out how new a user is is correct when he's "voted" in multiple AfD and predates the nom? I don't think it is, I believe it is a form of harassment. Since people can edit anonymously, they can accumulate quite a bit of experience before creating an account. The only valid reason to tag "experience" in an AfD is if the editor has only edited the area in question or if they are so new that they may be a sock. Period. Show me where it says otherwise. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 22:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jefferson Anderson, I certainly make mistakes, and I welcome people pointing out my mistakes. Am I "sure" that pointing out how new a user is in an AfD discussion when that user has already participated in other AfD's? I am never 100% sure of anything, and am willing to be corrected. However, I <i>believe</i> that it is appropriate to mention that an account is less than three weeks old. In Wikipedia, what is right and what is wrong is largely determined by the consensus of the community. The fact that HighInBC, who is an admin, seems to believe that there was nothing wrong, confirms in my mind that my opinion is likely to reflect the consensus of the community. Of course we <i>both</i> could be mistaken.</dd>

<dd>I guess I just don't get it, then. I just reviewed <b>all</b> the AfDs I've expressed an opinion in. Even when my account was much newer, not a single editor felt the need to tag by opinion like that. Now, my first <i>nomination</i> got a comment, and looks like I had overlooked something and somebody thought I might be a troll, but I just don't see what's different about this AfD that I should get called out as "too new". I feel offended by it. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 23:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Jefferson, You ask a good question about the fact that you had participated in other AfDs without the recentness of your account being noticed. I took at look at the AfDs in whichyou participated, and I think the answer is this. The AfDs in which you participated seemed to have attracted a small number of editors and were not really controversial. As a result, editors like myself, who would flag new accounts, were probably not paying close attention to these. I hope that helps to explain.

<dd>Kathryn, I have not gone through Jefferson Anderson's contributions. However, the one diff that you provided by Jefferson Anderson doesn't seem to demonstrate an assumption of bad faith. Did you mean some other contribution?</dd>
<dd>I have also wondered whether a retired user might return under a different username. However, I would not jump to conclusions that such a course would be <i>necessarily</i> malicious. It would be naive to discount the possibility of a bad faith return. However, it is also worth considering the possibility that a user might wish to turn over a new leaf, and feel that they are unable to escape their past without burying their identity. Other wikipedians may take a hard line on this which would certainly be understandable. But for me, I would like to see clear signs of disruption even if I knew a user to have made a deceptive "retirement". --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 00:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(unindent) Sorry, I see you did not miss the Rev. But I hope someone tells you to stop being so petty -- almost 2 months is not a "new user" as the term is used in ADF.

<dd>Thank you for your feedback on my behavior. Despite the harsh tone, such feedback is useful, because we frequently do not see ourselves as others see us. Your comment prompted me to scan some of the AfD discussions. Pointing out the recentness of account creation seems to be much rarer than was my impression. I will be more conservative about pointing out such facts in the future. Thank you.

<p>Indian usage------</p>
<p>Like the other English speaking countries, also India is currently strongly influenced by the usual U.S. short scale use. However – outside of financial media – the use of Indian English speakers highly depends on their education background. Some Indians may continue to use the traditional British long scale. In everyday life, Indians largely use their <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numbering_system.html" title="Indian numbering system">own system</a>.</p>
<p>I am hoping I may use the standard of modern British English which is that of Wikipedia. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 22:19, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm trying to make more user pages to remove items from my user page to sub pages. Somehow the pages I make end up in the article space instead. Do you know about this?

<dd>I don't know what I am talking about. I thought I was doing the same thing I usually do to create a user sub page. But it turned out to be an article page (mysteriously -- the way everything is around here). It was put up for deletion and I supported that with db-author. Also (on another subject) someone explained to me how to download an IRC client. But now that I have it, I don't know what to do with it. You probably know about this kind of thing. (Originally I wanted to access the AMA chat.) Also (on yet another subject), do you think it is early to ask for Checkuser, as the person in question says he is moving and getting another IP?

<dd>No, I'm not talking about Links. What I am talking about has disappeared -- no mention even on watchlist anymore. It started with Article -- is that the key?

One solution to this is do new page patrol from the bottom of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>, thereby tagging articles after they have been created for almost an hour and the author has had plenty of opportunity to get the article in a decent state.

<dd>I think Rosencomet received some bad advice and some bad examples, but now seems to be trying to work with the community. I don't see any benefit in keeping that fire going. I am actually somewhat disappointed that focus contiues to revolve around rosencomet. If there is a potential for continuing conflict, I think it comes more from the parties to the arbitration who previously advised Rosencomet.
