<h2><span class="mw-headline">Henry Cabot Lodge QUOTE</span></h2>
<p>I am soliciting comments about the possible inclusion of the following:</p>
<p>In the book "Boston" by Henry Cabot Lodge, I find a quote that I would like to add to the Boston page. It is,</p>
<p><i>In the political events which have affected the history of the entire country, and in shaping the thought of a people who have come to be a great nation, Boston has played a leading part.</i></p>
<p>from: Boston / Henry Cabot Lodge (New York&#160;: Longman's, 1891) Mark Preston 15:33, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you could summarize what the quote is saying and include it in a section regarding the history of Boston, but I'd stay away from actually including the quote unless you find an appropriate context for it. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 01:52, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you mean that you do not like the inclusion of this quote. I'm unable to <b>summarize</b> anything this short. It's only 35 words long. Mark Preston 01:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Metropolitan Status</span></h2>
<p>En l'article, Il est stated that the Boston, Worcester, Manchester metropolitan area was the fifth largest in the nation however, when the link is followed, BWM comes farther down. This shoudl be corrected. -Lindaige</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hardcore music scene</span></h2>
<p>An anonymous IP user recently added the following passage under culture:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Boston also has the biggest Hardcore(music) scene in the world. It is known as the 'Mecca' of Hardcore with many prominent bands rising in the beginnings of hardcore such as DYS, and recent bands exploding onto the scene such as American Nightmare/Give up the ghost and others leading the current state of hardcore such as Converge. It is also synonymous with violence, with the FSU crew being a prominent fixture in the Boston Hardcore music scene.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can anyone be able to verify this? Also, some of the sentences (notably the last. What does "it" refer to?) are unclear. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 16:33, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's poorly written, yes, but could be fixed up. There is no doubt that Boston is well-known for its hardcore and sXe scenes. Many internationally-known hardcore bands come from Boston (such as <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_Cunt_72bf.html" title="Anal Cunt">Anal Cunt</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropkick_Murphys_5d0d.html" title="Dropkick Murphys">Dropkick Murphys</a>, unfortunately).--AaronS 19:09, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Could someone be able to improve the above passage then? Personally, I am not knowledgeable in Boston's hardcore music scene. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 23:17, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The "it" refers to the scene there, it is known for its sometimes violent shows.</p>
<p>I added to the passage a bit to expand and justify it. I highlighted a famous record that came out of the scene as well as three well known clubs bands would frequent. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkco1_a031.html" title="User:Markco1">Markco1</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boston College</span></h2>
<p>The building shown in the photo attached to the ridiculous "Oxford in America" heading in not in the City of Boston, but in the City of Newton. It does not belong on this page, and has been removed. Unless Alumni Field, which I believe is the only major BC structure even partially in Boston, has won some award, I expect this phote to stay off of this page for good.</p>

<dd>Clearly the picture should be included, as it is Boston College. Listing schools such as Harvard BC and MIT which are not in Boston should be omitted by your logic, but these institutions make up a large part of what makes Boston great and should clearly be included, even if they are in Cambridge or Chestnutt Hill/Newton. However, Oxford in America should remain deleted. If you have a desire to forbid listing Harvard, MIT or BC from the Boston page, please begin a Deletion Review.

<dd>Given that there are so very many things that would make nice pictures that are unequivocally within Boston, I <i>don't</i> think a <i>picture</i> of Boston College is appropriate. And, yes, I think the descriptions of Harvard and MIT are inappropriately long. Harvard, MIT, Boston College are legitimately in the Boston <i>area.</i> MIT and Boston College are in the Boston area because they historically originated in Boston. I think including Harvard is a stretch, medical school or no, and justifying it on the basis of the acreage of the Arboretum is insane...</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vote on general city/neighborhood naming conventions!</span></h2>
<p>The basis for naming this page <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> instead of simply <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> and all other city articles according to a contrived [[City, State]] convention is a claim that this convention has been generally accepted. Yet there are important exceptions like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> (rather than <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York, New York</a>) and no record of a vote on this issue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarifying reason for removing Kyoto picture</span></h2>
<p>I mistyped my edit comment.</p>
<p>My point is that the words "Kyoto, for a thousand years the capital of Japan, is a sister city of Boston" <i>are</i> relevant to Boston (and is appropriately mentioned in the article). The picture itself is irrelevant, <i>as it shows nothing about Boston.</i> If we wanted to show a picture of Old City Hall and some strikingly similar building in France, to show that Old City Hall was built in French Second Empire Style, the building in France would be pictorially relevant. The picture of Kyoto is not. And we don't need pictures of Barcelona, Hangzhou, Melbourne Padua, Strasbourg, Sekondi-Takoradi or Taipei in the article either. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Harvard language</span></h2>
<p>I changed the wording to read "Harvard University, the nation's oldest institution of higher learning..." which is the language used in the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> article. AFAIK just about everyone acknowledges this. There's probably some rival somewhere with a strained interpretation of founding dates and "higher learning" that claims to be older but I don't know who it would be.</p>
<p>There are problems with "Harvard University, the nation's oldest and one of the world's most prestigious universities..." This can be read as "nation's oldest <i>university.</i>" The issue here is that Harvard is probably not the oldest institution in the U.S. to <i>call</i> itself a "university," or then again maybe it is, or then again maybe not. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> article awards UPenn that distinction, but I notice they don't actually give a year or a source for its being <i>called</i> a "university." <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> says it was first called a university in 1780—by the Commonwealth. As you'd expect, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_William_and_Mary_3d3c.html" title="College of William and Mary">College of William and Mary</a> folks have something to say about this; and they seem to think it <i>became</i> a university in 1779 though, like Dartmouth, it is never <i>called</i> that. So, there was a lot of "university" action going on in the late 1700s and Harvard was neck-and-neck with others. When it comes to "institution of higher learning," though, Harvard, at 1636 or 1638 or 1639 or whatever clearly is older than the College of William and Mary or any other obvious rival.</p>
<p>"America's first college," used earlier in the article, would be sorta OK but there's ambiguity about "America" (isn't necessarily limited to the U.S.) and "college" (doesn't always mean higher ed).</p>
<p>Per <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism</a>, there's no need to make the claim of "world's most prestigious."

<p>P. P. P. S. The explicit restriction to "United States" rather than "America" is probably a good idea, as the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_University_of_Santo_Domingo_b415.html" title="Autonomous University of Santo Domingo">Autonomous University of Santo Domingo</a> was founded in 1538, and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_San_Marcos_9083.html" title="National University of San Marcos">National University of San Marcos</a> in Lima, Peru in 1551. These seem to be the rivals for "oldest institution of higher learning in the Americas" (the Peru boosters apparently arguing that Santo Domingo being an island isn't really part of "the Americas"). I know that "America," singular means United States to you and me, but it doesn't to everyone.</p>

<dd>Actually, Leverett Circle is <b>not</b> a rotary, and hasn't been for quite some time now. It would be hard to argue for Charles Circle either. The ones I can think of that are definitely in the city:

<li>Oak Square</li>

<dd>Those are the only ones I can remember off-hand. I know there are more in Dorchester, Hyde Park, Roslindale, Southie, and West Rox.

<dd>2. Moot point though - it's not a rotary either. A rotary is such where all traffic must enter and go in a uniform direction (clockwise in right-hand countries such as the United States), before exiting onto whatever streets feed into it. Aububon Circle has traffic lights at it, nor is a driver required to drive in any sort of circular pattern to continue on their way.

<dd>Not an defining feature of a rotary (although I'd have to check the General Laws to see if that is a requirement for a "rotary intersection"). <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 04:53, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>6. Being a seasoned Boston driver who learned to drive in the city in a 67 bug with bad brakes and a sour clutch I can say Boston is full of Rotaries - and FWI even though JP thinks they are seperate they are part of Boston it was anexed in 1874. So here are a few Rotaries - JP area "Jamaica Way/Arbor Way/Pond St", "Arborway/Centre St", "Arborway/Forest Hills/Morton St" - Southie "University Dr/Dominic J Biancolli Blvd", Morissey Blvd, Wiliam J Blvd/Columbia Rd", Columbia Rd/Old Colony Ave/Preble St" and in Southie there is a Circle called Thomas park that could be considered a rotary. Some do have lights but they are not always active. Thats just a few that I can think of and there also a bunch in Cambridge but we can leave those out of this conversation.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why is Celsius first?</span></h2>
<p>The convention of Wikipedia, when discussing U.S. cities and regions, has been to use Farenheit first and Celsius second, in the same way that U.S. conventions of spelling are used in articles on U.S. topics (and British English is used for UK topics). In this article, Celsius is first. Why? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 16:26, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure at all that the English Wikipedia has "more readers and editors who use the metric measurement than use imperial measurements." A 95%+ majority of American users and more than half of British users feel more comfortable with imperial than metric, and together they constitute more than half of English Wiki users. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 03:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're an American, do you deny that it's so? Whether or not you like the fact, do you honestly think that more than 5% of Americans (nearly all of them immigrants) are more comfortable in Celsius than Fareneheit? How many do you think it is? 8%? Does anyone have a citation for the assertion that the English Wikipedia has more readers and users who feel more comfortable with Celsius? That would appear to fly in the face of what we know about people in the US and the UK, the two largest English-speaking countries in the world. At any rate, the "C-first" policy of this article is contrary to the other U.S. city articles, and I'm considering bringing the matter to Requests for Comment. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 23:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>World famous cities in the U.S. should be treated no differently from world famous cities outside of the U.S. (<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, etc.): use the city name for the article title, <i>period</i>.</li>
<li>All articles in Wikipedia should follow the <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">Wikipedia naming conventions for common names</a>, which dictate that <i>Boston</i> (alone) be the title of this article; there is no reason that cities, and <i>Boston</i> in particular, should be an exception to these rules.</li>
<li>Professional encyclopedias, both published and online, typically do not "pre-disambiguate"... neither should we.</li>
<li>Chance for confusion with anything else named <i>Boston</i> is minimal.</li>
<li>The name of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> alone redirects directly here, therefore there are no known significant disambiguation issues, and no reason to disambiguate.</li>
<li>Lesser known <b>Boston</b> articles are already handled on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Boston (disambiguation)">Boston (disambiguation)</a>.</li>
<li>Waiting to change the <i>city, state</i> convention does not make sense, since it is a chicken-egg situation. The only way to start to change the convention is one article at a time, like <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and this one.</li>
<li><i>Boston, Massachusetts</i> is part of a mailing address, not the name of the city. The name of the city is <i>Boston</i>; that should be the name of the article.</li>
<li>The one piece of information that the title is supposed to clearly specify is the most common name used to refer to the subject of the article. The current title is unclear on this point... is the most common name <i>Boston</i> or <i>Boston, Massachusetts</i>? Titles that use the <i>city, state</i> "comma naming convention" make it impossible for the reader to know. It is our job as editors to make this clear, not ambiguous.</li>
<li>Following a convention that pollutes the article title for <i>readers</i> (by making the common name unclear) in order to supposedly make life easier for <i>editors</i>, violates the <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">overall principle of Wikipedia's naming conventions</a>:</li>

<li>Yes, consistency in naming conventions should be valued, but which naming convention? What if one naming convention is itself inconsistent with another, which is the case we have here?

<dd>Yes, when the more specific conventions <i>build on</i> the general ones, not <i>contradict</i> them. For example, the general conventions are to disambiguate only when there is an actual disambiguation, and, then, to do so with a parenthetic remark. But they don't specify what to put in the parenthetic remark. So, a more specific convention could do that, and it would apply without contradicting the more general convention. But this concept of ambiguating when no ambiguity issue exists, and disambiguating with an ambiguity-creating comma (see reason #10 above) rather than with a parenthetic remark, is all unnecessary inconsistency with the more general conventions. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 00:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Serge, do you confirm the existing U.S. convention, or is this proposed move part of an overall attempt to change the convention. If it is the latter then we shouldn't describe it as a proposed exception to the convention, but rather as an assault on it. I note that there hasn't been any recent discussion on the topic before this strawpoll was started, and that the exact same language is being used to propose a similar change to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a>.

I don't have a problem with a convention being "assaulted" if that convention sucks. I haven't heard a good explanation for keeping this article here other than the convention. It seems no one can come up with a good reason for leaving it here at all, esp. when all the great cities of the world are following the city-only approach. Personally, I'm not sure I've ever heard someone refer to Boston as "Boston, Massachusetts". To my knowledge, the only reason the City, State convention was ever started was that all U.S. city articles were programmatically generated from the U.S. Census.

<dd>I've got nothing to hide. I've said repeatedly, I think the <i>city, name</i> convention is very problematic (see reasons above), and I seek to overturn it eventually. In the mean time, I seek to "free" certain cities one at a time as <i>exceptions</i> to the current naming convention guidelines, which are "not rules written in stone" (that's from <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)</a>).</dd>
<dd>So, what I've presented here is an argument for why Boston should be an exception to the <i>city, name</i> convention. I would expect those opposed to present arguments for why it should not be an exception. But instead, all we get is essentially, "it shouldn't be an exception because then it would be an exception". Well, duh. It's nonsense.

<dd>Believe me, I'm tired of this too. But the problem is that the naming conventions we currently have for U.S. cities (not to mention communities) is contrary to the very wise <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> convention of using the most common name when there is no ambiguation, and to ambiguate with a parenthetic remark when there is. As long as the city naming convention continues to be so inconsistent with the fundamental naming conventions used in Wikipedia, be prepared to tire of rebutting the same issues again and again. And it's not just me. Somebody else started the Chicago name change, and sixteen people other than me voted in support of it. The only solution is to solve the root problem: choose a city naming convention that is consisent with the very wise primary principles cited in <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a>. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 05:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
<p>There's an exaggeration on the climate section. Boston has never seen a huge 54 degree swing in temperatures, let alone being very common. That is like gong from 90 degrees to 36 degrees. I've never experienced that ever and would be highly unusual.

<dd>Okay, so what <b>is</b> the maximum "dynamic range" of temperatures ever experienced in Boston? If it's not 30C (54F), it must be some number approaching that because there have been plenty of days that go from freezing (literally) in the morning to 70s or high 70s by afternoon (so, say 43F, 24C).</dd>

<dd>There is no such number I could find, just averages. The point is that if the 54 degree number is not substantiated it shouldn't be on there. We can't just pull numbers out of the blue if we expect to keep accuracy.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regional Institutions / Gentrification</span></h2>
<p>"Over the past several years Boston has experienced a dramatic loss of regional institutions and traditions, which once gave it a very distinct social character. The city, like others, faces <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentrification.html" title="Gentrification">gentrification</a> issues and exorbitant living costs. Since the 1950s, however, Boston has once again emerged as a major hub of intellectual, technological, and political ideas."</p>
<p>This reads more like a high-school research paper than a coherent encyclopedia paragraph. Which regional institutions and traditions have been lost? What was the nature of their impact? Was this dramatic? What does this have to do with gentrification? Is their any source to verify that gentrification <i>is</i> a problem? Why are the "several years" of the first sentence contrasting a purported re-emergence starting in the 50s?</p>
<p>Should this be researched and reworked, or deleted?</p>

<dd>As a current Boston resident and long term resident in an adjacent county, I can tell you that problems with elections in Boston have been ongoing for many years. A Globe columnist described the 2003 situation as "infamous". The paragraph I added is a little too biased toward the 2006 situation. But that can be fixed by expansion, because there is significant history. I know there is a multi-year history of problems from personal knowledge, but the cited article also states it, and they are a reliable source. This <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/07/30/justice_dept_accuses_city_of_voting_rights_violations/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/07/30/justice_dept_accuses_city_of_voting_rights_violations/" rel="nofollow">Globe article</a> from June 2005 says that the problems date back to at least 1992. It also said the federal lawsuit was the 26th such suit in 30 years, which makes it clear that these are not run-of-the-mill incidents. If you want material critical of the DoJ, this <a href="http://www.electionconsulting.com/files/BeckerReport-Vol1-Issue2-200509.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.electionconsulting.com/files/BeckerReport-Vol1-Issue2-200509.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> is an example, but I'm not certain if it is a reliable source. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:20, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
