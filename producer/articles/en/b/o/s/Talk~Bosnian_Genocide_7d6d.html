<p>OK, kids, that was enough. Please stop this stupid edit war and start thinking about what to do with information in this article. Obviously it can't be called "Bosnian genocide" since (1) it's not a name commonly used to refer to the events and (2) it's an open invitation to edit warring. I suggest that we find a better name, like <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_war.html" title="Bosnian war">Bosnian war</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Bosnia_ac23.html" title="War in Bosnia">War in Bosnia</a> and write about its history properly. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 13:13, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason for the name of this article was based on the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> article. Just because some cannot personally deal with facts and the thruth is a weak excuse.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:13, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dado, <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> was actually just one event, so it's known after that name. "Bosnian Genocide" is a vague term, and like Zocky said, it just begs for edit wars. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Cabrilo</a> 03:42, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well I have raised this issue of a single event at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Talk%7ESrebrenica_Massacre_f4ee.html" title="Talk:Srebrenica Massacre">Talk:Srebrenica Massacre</a> page as a move to rename the article Srebrenica Genocide. Please see that page for more info. It is a bit dual standard if you are willing to name Rwanda Genocide and not name Bosnian Genocide while they were both proven by the same institution International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia. So far there has been only one person (who is still stuck in the eigth stage of the genocide see <a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm" rel="nofollow">Genocide Watch - The Eight Stages of Genocide</a>) has been willing to pursue an edit war on this article and looking at his other activity at Wikipedia it does not surprise me. Others have been constructive on this article. I do agree that this is a bit controversial topic but only because there is a small number of people who are willing to pursue an edit war for whatever personal subjective reasons. I will repeat that just because some cannot deal with facts and the truth it is a weak excuse to question the merits of this article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 16:49, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dado, I see your point, and I do not wish to undermine any attrocities committed in Bosnia. I am just saying that Rwandan Genocide is something that took place within few days, while it is unclear what would Bosnian Genocide be (there were many instances of massacres, of course... but hardly as a continuing spree that you can define by one name). <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a> is a better concept, for sure. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Cabrilo</a> 01:15, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Argh.. that just looks wrong&#160;:) What I wanted to say, of course, is that one article for one instance of genocide is a better concept than one article for all of war crimes. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">Dejan Cabrilo</a> 01:15, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only case which ICTY declared as a genocide in Bosnia so far (2005.5.) is Srebrenica. If you have links under ICTY which show different, please give them clearly. If you cannot, the only officialy proved genocide in Bosnia were in Srebrenica. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">User:oldadamml</a></p>
<p>You are correct. The only Bosnian Genocide that was proven so far in ICTY took place in Srebrenica. So why are you removing the entire page which is pretty much what is said in the judgement Prosecutor vs Krstic. In fact the article talks about what you are saying specifically. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 13:45, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm not removing the entire page, I just considered ICTY facts. You mentioned <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm</a>. There are no any mentioned Prijedor, Sarajevo, Banja Luka or others victims there. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">User:oldadamml</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I am stating again that you are correct that the only Bosnian Genocide that was proven at ICTY so far took place in Srebrenica. However what you are not saying is what I am exposing in this article and that is there are several other genocide proceedings currently going and few indictments for persons still at large responsible for genocide at the entire teritory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. See</p>
<p><a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm</a></p>

<p>Also see Schedule A and C for Milosevic trial. I know that you will say that these cases are not yet finished which is true and article stresses that any increase in numbers will take place only after these cases are complete. However it is critical to say that story is not over yet and that additional circumstances need to be considered as the scope of the genocide in Bosnia may increase.</p>
<p>-- Those are indictments and Schedule A and shedule C is irrelevant so far. Let's wait for the judgment. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">User:oldadamml</a></p>

Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic have been indicticed for genocide on the entire teritory of BiH (including Banja Luka, Prijedor and other areas)</p>

<p>Can anybody provide proof that "Bosnian genocide" refers to "The Bosnian Genocide was an organized murder of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995, where authorities of Republika Srpska and its Army targeted for extinction a wide group of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks)", i.e. that it excludes attrocities by Serbs against Croats, by Croats against Bosniaks and Serbs and by Bosniaks against Croats and Serbs?</p>

<dd>It seems to me that this should be dealt in a section in the article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_war.html" title="Bosnian war">Bosnian war</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Bosnia_ac23.html" title="War in Bosnia">War in Bosnia</a>, (which we still don't have) or in an article called War crimes in the Bosnian war. OTOH, if the point is just to describe what ICTY thinks about it, it should probably be merged to <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTY_337a.html" title="ICTY">ICTY</a>. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 10:24, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if contributors were to do everything you recommend, one could still re-create the <b>Bosnian Genocide</b> article and start writing <b>"The Bosnian Genocide was an organized murder of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995, where authorities of Republika Srpska and its Army targeted for extinction a wide group of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks)"</b>.

<p>Sorry, apologies if I'm out of line (literally meant--I'm not sure how to use these discussion boards so I'm just taking a guess). The term "Bosnian Genocide" (and similar expressions) <b>are recognized</b> in the academic spheres of Political Science, History, and Peace Studies. I've just completed a university course centered on genocide. Amongst numerous texts, I would recommend <b>Century of Genocide</b> to anyone who thinks that something as factual as the very title of this article is not neutral. The relevant chapter is entitled "Genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Sound familiar? --<a href="../../../a/d/t/User%7EAdtrace_7e4f.html" title="User:Adtrace">Adtrace</a> 07:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see that a lot of war crimes on this page (other then <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a>) are relevant to the page about <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>. Similar killings (not including Srebrenica) was on other sides, too. It would be usefull to say the sum of other killings, because the sum says the general number of killed people. It would be better to make other page about all victims of the Bosnian War. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 01:24, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, "proven by ICTY", as it is said, is only Srebrenica massacre/genocide, so it should be said in different way. However, statement about authorities of Republica Srpska is truth (I know that from Serbian side.) Also, "wide group of Bosniaks" should be explained. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 01:24, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that no mass killing of women and children was, too. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 01:42, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
First I would ask you to refer to the discussion on the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Talk%7ESrebrenica_Massacre_f4ee.html" title="Talk:Srebrenica Massacre">Talk:Srebrenica Massacre</a> where I raised an issue that given article should be renamed Srebrenica Genocide in light of the ICTY judgement which states this cearly and explains why. Some of the rethoric such as "wide group of Bosniaks" was taken directly from the judgement narrative of the Prosecutor vs Krstic case which proved the genocide.</p>
<p>The point was raised at the talk page that Srebrenica Massacre can be called a genocide only in a larger context as in case of <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> in a context of a country. Given this and also the parallels between the ICTY and ICTR and their genocide judgements it made only logical to start this article under its given name.</p>
<p>Other information noted in this article is clearly marked as being depended on other genocide proceedings (which are relevant). Perhaps noting which proceedings would help. I am not excluding a possiblity the the main definition of this article may evolve to include genocide over Croats as well (as there are Genocide indictments currently at ICTY that claim this) and to include information on the genocide on Serbs if any such indictment ever take place. If you agree with this concept we can resolve details easily (I hope).</p>
<p>Also I support the idea that there should be an article about Bosnian War to include all victims of the war --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:20, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Millosh, there are also some discussions that took place at <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanja_Luka_c628.html" title="Talk:Banja Luka">Talk:Banja Luka</a> that you may find interesting regarding the crediblity of the person that initiated this edit war and lost any NPOV consideration on my part for further discussion. This is not a fair nor a productive way to initiate a discussion on this topic while the same individual still has an open door policy to vandalize both articles as he sees fit. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:49, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did read both talk pages and I'll explain my position: --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 06:11, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Genocide is a hard word and it mainly refers to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>: organized killings of millions of human beings because of ideology of supreme nation. During the Bosnian war there were no such ideology and there were no organized killings of <i>all</i> members of some population. However, there <i>were</i> ideology of ethnic clean territories, a lot of hate, ordinary killers and people with mental disorders with guns, as well as <i>one organized mass killings of the male part of one population</i>. With those facts, I prefer to call article <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Genocide_3fe2.html" title="Srebrenica Genocide">Srebrenica Genocide</a>, but I prefer to move this article into the name like War crimes during the War in Bosnia, which should intend to describe <i>all</i> war crimes during that war. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 06:11, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that it is malicious not to call event in Srebrenica as genocide -- only because there were no killings of women and children. It can be treated as "revenge" or whatever, but it <i>was</i> organized mass killings of one part of one group of people, based on ethnicity and/or religion. However, it was not general behaviour of authorities of RS during the war, such was in Rwanda, such was in Nazi Germany. However, again, we should carefully research one by one event. Inside of this article I see very different numbers: (1) if one human is killed, it is a crime; (2) if couple of humans are killed, it was a big crime; (3) if 10 or 100 soldiers were killed after their surrendering, it was a big war crime; (4) but, if 10 or 100 people, not soldiers, were killed to make territory "ethnic clean", it was a genocide, too. So, if we find some other such event, we can call it as genocide. But, with a lot of respect to all of victims, we should be <i>very conservative</i> in naming something as genocide. I think it is better to waste a lot of time in gathering relevant information before we put that name. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 06:11, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And to ask here for better organization: May we gather all problematic articles on one place (at the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Balkan_NPOV_page" class="extiw" title="m:Balkan_NPOV_page">m:Balkan NPOV page</a>) and start to work on those problems?

Our situation is more complicated, so I am sure that such notice would not be enough. But, we should work on that. Also, I think that we should make NPOV pages here and to implement it on our local Wikipedias. However, I am sure that it is problematic question. In general, I can say that any page about this matter which is NPOV would be implemented in Serbian Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 06:11, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We can move this to BalkanNPOV but I find it useful to be on this page as well for others to reference. We could copy it to have a record on both pages once we are done.</p>
<p>I do agree that genocide is a strong word. This word is not something that should be used easily hence I point to sources that have the credibility to call something genocide (ie. ICTY). If you have issue with the credibility of ICTY that is another discussion.</p>
<p>But regardless, let’s take for the sake of discussion that ICTY is a credible source. In that case our personal opinions should not matter (NPOV Wiki policy). Following is an exact official narrative issued by ICTY regarding the Srebrenica massacre:</p>
<p>“In Prosecutor v. Krstic, a landmark ruling that put to rest any doubts about the legal character of the massacre, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia unanimously ruled that it was an act of genocide. As the Chamber’s judgment states:</p>
<p>By seeking to eliminate a part of the Bosnian Muslims, the Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide. They targeted for extinction the 40,000 Bosnian Muslims living in Srebrenica, a group which was emblematic of the Bosnian Muslims in general.…The Appeals Chamber states unequivocally that the law condemns, in appropriate terms, the deep and lasting injury inflicted, and calls the massacre at Srebrenica by its proper name: genocide. Those responsible will bear this stigma, and it will serve as a warning to those who may in future contemplate the commission of such a heinous act.”</p>
<p>There are clear gradations of crimes that are identified at the ICT ranging from incidents, to murders, war crimes, massacres, genocides and holocausts in such order. There should not be any confusion that genocide is not a holocaust. You cannot relate holocaust of 6 million Jews and 5 million Slavs and Roma in WW II with genocide of 8000 Bosnians in Srebrenica hence the difference in terminology. I could relate them on another level to say that they were both genocides but that WWII crimes went a step further.</p>
<p>For all these reasons I think it is fruitless to discuss if the genocide in Srebrenica was really genocide but rather killing in revenge, killing of male only, killing of POV’s etc. etc. The main question is if you are willing to accept ICTY ruling as a credible source. I should also point out that there were and still are those who question the credibility of Nuremberg trials although it was probably most beneficial for German people in the long run.</p>
<p>Now if you and others have trouble understanding and accepting what ICTY is and what it means than I will certainly talk about those issues. I will help you find information on how they arrived to their judgments as I am certain that all of those points that you are stating some of which are credible to a certain degree were also raised at the ICTY during the genocide proceedings. I will not however negotiate facts and judgments that were accepted at ICTY just because they don’t feel cozy to some. On the other hand you will find accepting it a much better alternative to get closure on this subject than to allow the situation to escalate where emotions and people who cannot control them take the issue over (on both sides).--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:43, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>While ICTY's findings are mostly well researched and proven, the fact remains that it is used for political purposes (e.g. delaying Croatia's EU ascendency talks) and that it refuses to even investigate alleged war crimes committed by foreign powers (e.g. NATO). Even if we all agree here that ICTY is a 100% credible source, there are millions (probably the majority) of people in countries that it directly applies to (Serbia, BH and Croatia) who would disagree with us. Ergo, ICTY is not an undisputed source and it must be treated in the same way, i.e. quoted and attributed (but not necessarily equally prominent) as other sources.</li>
<li>Naming conventions tell us to use the most common name for things, persons and events. For the mass murder in Srebrenica, it's "Srebrenica massacre", not "Srebrenica genocide". "Srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide" is a correct sentence.</li>
<li>"Bosnian genocide" <i>is</i> used by some people to mean what this article assumes that it does, so the name itself could be justified, but I still think that it would work better and cause less edit warring in a wider article.</li>
<li>The article as it is now reads as advocacy, not an encyclopedia article. Dado, I understand that you believe that everything it says is correct, and I also have no reason to doubt the accuracy of presented facts. But the way it is written now, a reader can tell that it was written by somebody who has chosen a side in the Bosnian war. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with chosing sides in real life, it's just not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 16:25, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well I don’t think it is scientific either.</p>
<p>Regardless of what I personally think and which side I take; hypothetically, on one hand you have a university with an immense body of knowledge, expertise and invested time into proving a theory. On the other hand you have a local coffee shop spewing out legends and conspiracy theories that are used to entertain the masses and keep them blind. Which one would you use to create an encyclopedia?</p>
<p>I am willing to state that both exist but there is no doubt in my mind which one is more credible. Otherwise Wikipedia will become just a conglomeration of fancier forum type discussions without a clear layering of facts and without a clear hierarchy of relevance. If we are here to write down coffee house fairy tales than I don’t want to have any part in it as it adds 0 qualities to Wikipedia and as I can do that on any other forum on the internet. Also I am not willing to hide and obscure facts in a different article just so that some people may feel cozier, while there is a clear precedent (<a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>) article to follow.</p>
<p>I will not be so naïve to deny that politics have their hand in everything but claiming the exact level of their involvement in this is highly subjective. As an example, how do you explain a plea bargain where one of the convicts (I think it was Nikolic case but I may be wrong) gets 5 years in prison for killing 70 people.</p>
<p>So can we agree that this article or information provided therein is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Factually correct</li>
<li>Relevant to be called in its given name</li>
<li>That Srebrenica Massacre article should retain its original name but only if there is a Bosnian Genocide article to put it in a larger context as in the case of Rwandan Genocide article</li>
<li>That it should include information on both completed genocide cases and the cases that may potentially change the nature and the scope of its meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these principles are acceptable than we can move to fine tune the article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:14, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that all of it is correct, but I don't know, as there are no references to sources where I could check.</li>
<li>I still think that this information, if presented out of context of crimes on other sides will be an endless edit war battlefield, so I would prefer to merge it elsewhere, but I agree that the current name is relevant and if other people think that it's good where it is, I have no problem with that.</li>
<li>Srebrenica Massacre article should be called that regardless of where we put this. It's a separate issue.</li>
<li>I'm not sure whether it should include all the cases that may (or may not, that's what "may" means) "change the nature and the scope of its meaning". How do we establish that?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are some of the problems I have with the article as it is now written:</p>
<ul>
<li>It treats ICTY as the word of god. Even if we accept ICTY as a 100% reliable source, we can't report its findings like we report easily observable natural phenomena.</li>
<li>The purported number of people killed in the genocide (100,000-250,000) is probably larger than the total number of dead in the war, including military and civilian casualties on all sides.</li>
<li>Quotes by Karadžić and especially Rašković are too prominent in the article, presented out of context, and unreferenced.</li>
<li>The data in the breakdown is undated, unreferenced and not all of it looks necessarily relevant - cases of several men killed in a town can arguably be attributed to military or personal matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 20:52, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's start with some information that we currently have regarding the data in the breakdown which is combined Schedule A and Schedule B lists of Killings not Associated with Detention Facilities and Killings Associated with Detention Facilities from the Milosevic trial Indictment <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-ai040421-e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-ai040421-e.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. You can also find dates on those schedules but I think that it may be just too much information. It may be usefull to put the date of the Indictment which is April 21, 2004. I would definatelly put the above link in the article for more information including also:</p>

<p>I would gladly consider other sources if you can provide links.</p>
<p>I do agree with some of your concerns and I will think about the organization of the article further as there may be an ambiguity between what is a judgment and what is an indictment and what may and what may not "change the nature and the scope of its meaning".</p>
<p>Around 105,000 people killed is a current estimate but there are two ways to calculate the number of victims (which I am not going to get into now). The larger question is if all 105,000 can be considered as genocide in this article and the answer at this point is probably not. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 21:58, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Good Day,</p>
<p>I am curious to know why there is only reportings on Non-Serb murders? Since this is about the "bosnian" genocide; I Demand that you include Croat and Serb murders!!! The NPOV is lost in this article completely. How can you call it the Bosnian genocide if it is only targeted against Bosniaks? Call it the Bosniak Genocide!</p>
<p>I would like to find about the other deaths of Croats and Serbs in the "bosnian" genocide. Bosnia doesn't just include Bosniaks you know? It is a rainbow of different people. This article is biased as it does not acknowledge the Genocide of Croats and Serbs (Serbs in particular) in the "bosnian" genocide!!! I suggest you delete the article in it's entirety and start over with an introduction similar to this (watch for the NPOV&#160;:P)</p>
<p>The Bosnian Genocide took place during the 1990's and involved genocidal attacks and beliefs from the Bosniak, Croat, and Serb parties. The evidence leading to the proof of this genocide can be found below.</p>
<p>The Genocide was an extension of the Yugoslavian Genocide (1941-45)...</p>
<p>I bid you all a farewell...</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersehen,</p>
<p>-Gustav-</p>
<p><br />
We've been over this. Other than to say that this person should read the article carefully before jumping to conclusions I could say that article may need to reinforce what the genocide is and differentiate it from other victims of war. It also reinforces the notion that there should be an article about victims of Bosnian War on all sides.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 00:42, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Huh... We are at the middle of the talk. I think that this page should be renamed into War crimes during the War in Bosnia or something like that because there were only one sanctionied act of genocide (<a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a>) and a lot of war crimes on all sides. However, we are at the beginning of the road. And we would talk about it for a months (maybe years).

<p>I think it sounds silly. It is just a fancier elaboration of the same title. We are not trying to design an article here (including the name). Call it what it is. Just as a thought to give you some insight to the commonality of the name.</p>

<p>The name should not be disputed but the definition may. I do think that there should be a separate article perhaps as you named it above (War crimes during the War in Bosnia) or Victims of the Bosnian War but such article should differentiated between killings, war crimes and the genocide.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:22, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of locations and the number of Muslims killed refers to a specific event: Bosnian Genocide.</p>

<p><br />
To my knowledge there were indictments that also included genocide of Croats in region of Bosanska Krajina. I am not aware of any indictments of killing of Serb population as genocide (but I could be wrong). Or we can simply call it the killing of Bosnian nationals (without specifying the ethnicities).</p>
<p>I think we should be careful not to enter a gray zone here if we decide to introduce all war crimes as genocide. We will have edit wars from all sides speculating on a definition and which war crimes should be considered a genocide.</p>
<p>So far ICTY had provided the most extensive reasearch to where genocide occured in Bosnia. I think their work should be used as a basis but other credible sources should be introduced as you described them. I do agree that controversial and untrue claims by important sources should be described as such, not omitted.</p>
<p>Let me remind that the genocide is not a single event but a series of systematic and planned actions that are designed to bring a destruction of a certain group or groups. Please see <a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm" rel="nofollow">Eight Stages of genocide</a> for more info. This also include a denial as one of the stages of the genocide.</p>
<p>Data that is currently used is from ICTY. I would ask that you bring to light other sources as I will look for them as well. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:55, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statement "Some of the information presented here has not been established as fact.

<dd>Wikipedia's accuracy dispute policy (<a href="../../../a/d/_/WP%7EAD_5bbf.html" title="WP:AD">WP:AD</a>) should be followed. I would suggest taking that disclaimer off (<b>Some of the information presented here has not been established as fact.

Don't remove the POV tag until all disputes have been negotiated (<a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:Negotiation</a>).

<dd>I have removed the disclaimer as it just did not serve any purpose. As the article appeared before there were more items pasted denouncing the entire article that the actual issues than need to be resolved. I have moved dubious statement to specific sentances that are problematic. If we are going to use that system I would ask anyone if they have objections to paste the dubious tag on a specific sentance or a portion of the text. I have also rephrased the definition as stated above. I think there are still some issues to be resolved here so anyone's input will be welcomed.

<p>I have added a sentance to "Recent developments" section that I find important to consider and I hope you will agree. Question: If we already have a "dubious" tag at the portion of the article that is disputed i.e. "Killings admitted as evidence at ICTY" does the entire article need to start with the POV tag at the top. I would think that if we resolved a good chunk of disputes at this article that POV tag should be removed and other disputes should be resolved on a case by case basis.

Again I don't see anywhere that she said that she lied before the court. Only in one paragraph the author of the text is interpreting her statement about not creating a contract to accept the guilty plee (which is untrue because she did accept the contract as can be seen from the official judgement).

"says that she decided to admit guilt in front of the Hague tribunal when she realised that it is completely impossible for her to proove her innocence and supply defence witnesses"; "she doesn't deny that crimes were committed by the Serbian side during war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.

You stated "she admitted that she lied when she pleaded guilty." I don't see anywhere explicitly that she said that she lied. Lieing in from of the court is a serious offense and you better be dead on with your claims. All she said was bunch of inconclusive political fluff that can be interpreted in several different ways and where one cannot see what were the entire circuimstances of her statement. Every plea bargain comes with certain conditions. Everything else is her POV which we can add in the article but I see no point.</p>

So now you are saying that she did not say she lied. I don't know when and where she stated that she was not guilty after she admitted that she was guilty before the court. Or perhaps this is what you are refering to.</p>
<p>"kaže da je odlučila da prizna krivicu pred Haškim tribunalom kada je shvatila da je potpuno nemoguće da dokaže svoju nevinost i da obezbedi svedoke odbrane, jer niko nije želeo da svedoči."</p>
<p>She realized that it was "immposible to prove her innocence and find witnesses for her defense because no one wanted to testify" .</p>
<p>Hm. What could that mean? Perhaps that she is guilty and no one would want to lie before the court so save her? Well one is presumed innocent until proven guilty and she was proven guilty.

<p>Last changes are an improvement, but I have to note that now the article is internally inconsistent. Introduction states that "Bosnian Genocide was an organized killing of Bosnians during the war between 1992 and 1995", then the following sentence says that "Bosnian Genocide is a term used by some academic and human rights institutions when referring to the case of genocide that took place in Srebrenica". <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:43, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>ICTY declared Srebrenica massacre as an act of genocide. Academic and Human rights groups refer to this act of genocide as a Bosnian genocide. Hence the definition of Srebrenica massacre is the same as definition of Bosnian genocide. If A=B and B=C, than A=C as well, where A = Srebrenica massacre, B = act of genocide and C = Bosnian genocide.

<p>The fact that the study was conducted a year ago couldn't possibly be less relevent.

<p>I also disagree on the name of this article, for one thing; if it's called Bosnian Genocide than besides the Srebrenica Massacre you should include Kravica Massacre (over 1000 Serbs were slaughtered in relative proximity of Srebrenica by Bosniaks), and murders of Croats as well. Next thing: Genocide does not exist unless it's ackgnowledged by the world; as far as I know there are still more opponents to this theory than there are suppoters, since all 3 sides have had blood on their hands and commited horrifying war crimes, so more appropriate word would be Massacre, as it's beeing used in literature. The word genocide is very ungratefull to use in the Balkans since there have been many during history, so ackgnowledgement of only one would be extremely unfair to the others (take <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasenovac.html" title="Jasenovac">Jasenovac</a> genocide as an example, where hundreds of thousands of Serbs have perished during WWII) and would lead to chain reaction, which would be very risky in the Balkans that has lately commited itself to European integrations. It could also apply to at least 5,000 Serbs that are currently missing in Kosovo and thousands more in former yugoslav republics....the proof for this claim would probably be the enormous pressure that has been put on B&amp;H government by international community to drop charges (for genocide) against Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

<p>Let me clarify something here. Just because there is 63K of opinions on this discussion page it does not grant the general clearance to anyone to randomly dispute this article without justifying the dispute with specific valid and credible issues. Most of the issues presented here were either pure garbage and personal grievences with the facts or they were already corrected in the article.</p>
<p>On top of that the anonimous user has recently entered this article and has violated 3RR and was banned for 8 hours only to be back as a sock puppet under different IP. I refuse to waste my time and engage in a discussion with the user that 1. Apparently does not understand how the Wikipedia works or 2. know's is well enough to pose as sock puppet to avoid the ban on his aggressive behaviour on this article. 3. has apparently no understanding of the issue and 4. Has probably not even read the article.</p>

<p>I dispute this article, not its content, but its purpose for existence. By the article's own admission, the only case of genocide in Bosnia was the Srebrenica massacre. Since we already have an article about the Srebrenica massacre, why do we need this article? Surely all the information in here is already in the Srebrenica massacre article (or can be added if it isn't)? <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 21:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article is relevant for many reasons some of which have been explained on this discussion page back 6 months ago so I would suggest you to read it thoroughly. The simplest way to explain it, the article is based on a similar grounds as the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> article. Furthermore the term Bosnian Genocide is in regular use and the article explains that and provides relevant sources.</p>
<p>It's true that only case of genocide proven so far is Srebrenica massacre. However there are at least 3 other court cases ongoing that are based on indictments for genocide on the other regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (in particular <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosanska_Krajina_0429.html" title="Bosanska Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a>). All of that is quite clearly spelled out on the article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 22:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That comparisson doesn't make sense at all. The Rwandan Genocide refers to a single, continuous act which took place over only a few days. On the other hand, it's not even clear what the Bosnian Genocide refers to. If it refers to only the Srebrenica massacre, then it should be merged with the article about the latter, since it is against Wikipedia policy to have multiple articles about the same thing. If it refers to the entire Bosnian war, then you would have to prove that the entire war was one big genocide, which not even the ICTY has claimed. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 15:21, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you dispute the article's existance then take it to the AfD and see if it passes. I think the only reason you don't is because you know the nomination would go up in flames.

<p>I wrote the following a couple of days ago, but did not post it for some unexplained reason. Looks like <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> beat me to it in the meantime. But anyway, here goes. I see nothing in this text that required a separate article and couldn't have been placed in the alredy existing Srebrenica Massacre article. For one, its non-Srebrenica content is three-lines long and it's still called BOSNIAN genocide. Srebrenica alone (a town in Eastern Bosnia that covers oh-I-don't-know 1.5% of its territory) is hardly entire Bosnia. In an attempt to "pad the stats" article then uses a lot of 'may had been', 'statistcs still may change' weasel stuff in the Recent Developments section which as I said is the only non-Srebrenica part of the article. <a href="../../../z/v/o/User%7EZvonko_f9ca.html" title="User:Zvonko">User:Zvonko</a></p>
<p>Back to present day. As for the responses. What Dado calls "regular use" is a stretch to say the least. And what Asim referred to as "widely-used and accepted term" is a wild exaggeration. The article talks about “some academics” (doesn’t mention which ones – grounds for <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html#Generalization_in_the_use_of_weasel_words" title="Weasel words">weasel wording</a>) and "some human rights organizations" (again without any references). But even if these were to be produced (hopefully, you'll cite the basis for such a statement), "some academics and some human rights organizations" is hardly "widely-used, accepted term" and "regular use".<a href="../../../z/v/o/User%7EZvonko_f9ca.html" title="User:Zvonko">User:Zvonko</a></p>

<p><br />
All of these links talk about what went on in Srebrenica, and mention the term 'Bosnian' as a geographical adjective in an effort of making the story more accessible and readily comprehended because they're aware 'Srebrenica' by itself means nothing to most of their readership. It's the same as writing "Croatian skier wins Schladming slalom", or "Serbian b-baller drops in 25points" instead of "Ivica Kostelic wins....." or "Nenad Krstic drops...." knowing these two names ring no bells for majority of the readers around the world.</p>
<p>It would be pretty pointless to write two articles on Wikipedia named "Nenad Krstic" and "Serbian basketball player", both about Nenad Krstic, using the above as the basis. Having two articles about the same thing is pointless. This article offers nothing that Srebrenica massacre didn't already. <a href="../../../z/v/o/User%7EZvonko_f9ca.html" title="User:Zvonko">Zvonko</a></p>
<p>Actually, Google returns 736 hits when Wikipedia is excluded<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bosnian+genocide%22+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bosnian+genocide%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Add to that that some of them are not mention of the article's supposed subject, but of "a Bosnian genocide" (such as the above article from Taipei Times) and the number is even smaller. The term is in some use, but it doesn't mean what this article says it does. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 08:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Searching just for "Bosnian genocide" limits the matter, although it shows the exact term this article takes is still pretty commonly used (the Taipei Times article is an exception rather than the rule). Searching for Bosnia and Genocide as well as Bosnian and Genocide without wikipedia links comes up with somewhere around 1,600,000 hits. Of these, only 168,000 mention Srebrenica. Just because the exact term "Bosnian genocide" isn't as commonly used says little more than that such a recent historical event does not have an established term in textbooks. If you searched the exact titles of current event articles from the front page you wouldn't get nearly as many results as just generally searching for the event in question. This is a similar situation here. Despite how the facts might be twisted around by Smolenski, it is hardly a wild assertion that a genocide occured in Bosnia. For an interesting comparison, the search for Bosnia Genocide above actually had more links than Armenia genocide. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 12:31, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'd say that Taipei Times is rule rather than exception.

<dd>Because the articles on the Bosnian genocide and the Srebrenica massacre are not the same thing, just like the article on the Holocaust and Auschwitz are not the same thing.

<dd>Wrong.

<dd>There could be a million charges of genocide, that's irrelevent because only Srebrenica is recognized.

<p>It is quite relevant that the same institution that defined the Srebrenica massacre as the act of genocide is conducting several other trials including genocide in other regions of Bosnia that share the same established doctrine that Srebrenica event had. It is not suprising that many consider this as a commonality that is defined in terms of a Bosnian genocide or that the Srebrenica is only an example of what has happened elsewhere in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Also here is an excerb from Milosevic indictment:</p>
<p><i>COUNTS 1 and 2</i> GENOCIDE OR COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE</p>
<ol>
<li><i>From on or about 1 March 1992 until 31 December 1995, Slobodan MILOSEVIC, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation and execution of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the Bosnian Muslim national, ethnical, racial or religious groups, as such, in territories within Bosnia and Herzegovina, including: Bijeljina; Bosanski Novi; Brcko; Kljuc; Kotor Varos; Prijedor; Sanski Most and Srebrenica. The destruction of these groups was effected by:</i></li>
</ol>
<p><i>The widespread killing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims during and after the take-over of territories within Bosnia and Herzegovina, including those listed above, as specified in Schedule A to this indictment. In many of the territories, educated and leading members of these groups were specifically targeted for execution, often in accordance with pre-prepared lists. After the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995, almost all captured Bosnian Muslim men and boys, altogether several thousands, were executed at the places where they had been captured or at sites to which they had been transported for execution.</i> etc.. etc..</p>
<p>Others indictments are relatively similar. Now it stands that this trial is still ongoing but the article that we have here is very carefull not to make presuptions of guilt until the trial is finished.</p>
<p>Your suggestion that each incident will have its article is probably true but it is also clear that this article binds them together in what is acceptable and relatively widely used term.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 00:31, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There are entire books written on the subject, hundreds of thousands of mentions on the internet, and a clear presence in the relative political arenas. That the article shouldn't exist because only one incident has been labeled as such by an international court completely misses the point: the event is so recent that the international court in question hasn't had time to rule on all charges. And asserting that the article shouldn't exist even if there were multiple acts of genocide recognised by an international court is ridiculous, considering the wide variety of umbrella articles on wikipedia for a series of sub-articles with far less in common. There are many other holes in your arguement but, in short, I disagree; and I also feel that if this article was put up for deletion that many others would disagree as well. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 00:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Bosnian Genocide or Bosnia Genocide was an organized killing of Bosnians, predominantly male Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) during the war between 1992 and 1995 by authorities of Republika Srpska and its Army.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Bosnian Genocide is a term used by some academic and human rights institutions when referring to the case of genocide that took place in Srebrenica which has been proven at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) through the court case entitled Prosecutor vs Krstić (see Srebrenica Massacre). Thus far the Srebrenica massacre has been the only case which the UN Hague tribunal has officially defined as genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presentation of evidence implicating the killing of at least 8,000 persons, predominantly Bosniaks has been made. Bosnian-Herzegovina Commission for Missing Persons claims that the number of killings is much greater than has been currently represented at the tribunal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While actually Bosnian Genocide is a propaganda term used by some media, human rights groups and governments in order to create impression that in Bosnia, organized killing of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) happened during the war between 1992 and 1995 by authorities of Republika Srpska and its army. In reality, no such thing happened. There were instances of RS army killing Bosniak civilians, but there were also numerous instances of it not killing them when it easily could, and instances of Bosnian Muslim army killing Serb civilians.</dd>

Either way, if you really want to make an issue of it, I could point out that all of the figures you searched for achieved their fame at a time when the internet had attained great world-wide popularity, whereas the Bosnian Genocide occurred well before this period of time.

<p>Asim finally concluded "<i>Just because the exact term "Bosnian genocide" isn't as commonly used says little more than that such a recent historical event does not have an established term in textbooks.</i> "</p>
<p>Exactely, and here you're prejudicating that it will or that it should have an established term in textbooks. Wikipedia is not to be used for writing history.

<dd>Asim Led would appreciate it if Zvonko would stop writing in 3rd person seeing as it is getting mildly ridiculous. Asim Led would also like to point out the numerous smaller cases of genocide wholly separate from Srebrenica that, when searched for specifically, together attain dozens of thousands of hits as well. Asim Led would further like to note that the fact that cases dealing with these instances of genocide have not yet been resolved in international court as of early 2006 should not cause any obstruction seeing as this lack of official recognition can be easily pointed out and followed by a list of facts on the matter. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 06:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you can't talk about something that isn't defined by trying to define it (at least not in an encyclopedia entry) and then correct it by pointing out: 'oh, by the way, this strictly speaking doesn't really exist as such, though it very well may have, and here's why I think that it should exist or that it will'. Srebrenica does not equal entire Bosnia. Either have this article be about War crimes in Bosnia which would include all the non-Srebrenica stuff or have it concetrate on legal aspects of Srebrenica, as I suggested below.<a href="../../../z/v/o/User%7EZvonko_f9ca.html" title="User:Zvonko">Zvonko</a> 02:01, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...Isn't defined as genocide, the article itself is trying to define it as such. This article, the way its currently written, takes Srebrenica (which does have legal basis to be mentioned in terms of genocide) and tries to lump it in with other war crimes committed against Muslims (which no court ever labeled as genocide). According to its title, the article is implying a Bosnia-wide genocide committed by Serbs against Muslims took place (and maybe it's also saying that Croats, too, 'effectively helped Serbs along' for a period of time, it isn't really clear). As evidence it offers 1 or 2 pending court cases the outcome of which can certainly not be psychically predicted even though it tries to. That is what I object to. The article is called Bosnian Genocide and yet it only talks about Srebrenica. All of the other non-Srebrenica stuff that would hopefully justify the adjective "Bosnian" in its title (meaning: more than just Srebrenica) is speculation and predictions. So, as I said, my suggestion is to either have the article be about legal side of Srebrenica (which in large part it is already) or to give it a major re-haul into War Crimes in Bosnia theme (although that may be a bit too ambitious) but it would be a start.<a href="../../../z/v/o/User%7EZvonko_f9ca.html" title="User:Zvonko">Zvonko</a> 11:47, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ICTY prosecution has labeled incidents in Omarska camp, Manjaca camp, Brcko, Zvornik, Visegrad and Sarajevo as genocide (to name few). International court of Justice has a case of BiH vs SCG for genocide that is to begin shortly. The trials are not finished but that does not lessen the fact that acts commited can be defined as genocide under the Roman statute and that is what many sources are doing including academic and media. Article is carefull about not to jump to conclusions before the trial is over but it serves at least to point to other cases of war crimes that many in the world consider to be also cases of genocide on the teritory of BiH.</p>

<li>If a partisan source claims it happened, then the claim should be attributed to that source (e.g. <i>...according to source X, this happened ...</i>).</li>

<dd>Main problem with the article is that it claims that "The Bosnian Genocide was an organized killing of Bosnians during the war between 1992 and 1995 by authorities of Republika Srpska and its Army." Authorities of Republika Srpska and its army have never organised a killing of Bosnians on a level which would encompass entire Bosnia or a significant portion of it, nor does anyone claim that they did, including even ICTY (which is illegal and not impartial, and it isn't logical fallacy to say so), and so there has been no event which could be described as "the Bosnian Genocide". <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 22:40, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sorry, Nikola, but ICTY is commonly viewed as legitimate and, as far as I know, is recognised as such by every member of the UN, so their rulings, for our purposes at least, are valid. If an institution of some credibility were to doubt its legitimacy, then you could say something like <i>the incident at Srebrenica was held to be a case of genocide by the ICTY, however, their impartiality and legitimacy have been contested by X, Y and Z</i>. If every credible institution however acknowledges its legitimacy, then nothing need be mentioned and their legitimacy and impartiality are presumed, therefore it is also presumed that the Srebrenica incident was both factually and legally a case of genocide.</p>
<p>However, as the ICTY defined only the Srebrenica incident as genocide (didn't it?), I'm suggesting that the contested paragraph be replaced with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The <b>Bosnian Genocide</b> or Bosnia Genocide was a massacre of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnians.html" title="Bosnians">Bosnians</a>, predominantly male <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a> (Bosnian Muslims), conducted by the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Republika_Srpska_5488.html" title="Army of Republika Srpska">Army of Republika Srpska</a> during July 1992.</i></dd>

<p>This subject is far too fishy - so you'll have to understand, Dado, if I don't want to get involved any deeper. I wish to note another compromise: On wikipedia, we have established that the Croatian military is responsible for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Medak_pocket_c09a.html" title="Operation Medak pocket">Operation Medak pocket</a> and Gorski Kotari massacres of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> in the Croatian Civil War - and that the massive exodus of the Serbian populace from Croatia in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Storm_d6ec.html" title="Operation Storm">Operation Storm</a> was caused by the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Army_8e48.html" title="Croatian Army">Croatian Army</a>'s military campaign.

The reason why the sentence is stating "authorities" is because there were several police and paramilitary units organized by the government who also commited a great deal of killings. But we can be more explicit than that to avoid any confusion.</p>

I think you are refering to a list of Serbs allegedly killed near Srebrenica prior to the massacre. The list surfaced in early part of 2005 and was made public in BiH on a day when a major police reorganization agreement was supposed to take place to divert attention or gain political points on the fact that RS MUP was supposed to be abolished. No proof was ever given in relation to the list and the list has been discredited numerous times. Naser Oric is on trial at the ICTY for plundering property during the war.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:50, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Other cases did not get further than allegations AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong), and, again, to my knowledge, no one is accused in ICTY for genocide in cases other than Srebrenica.

<dd>This article was never nominated for AfD. Cases other than Srebrenica case are still ongoing and they are not merely allegations but rather indictments for genocide on ICTY. Two of them (Karadzic and Mladic) have gone through Rule 61 rulling where a court has taken a case only short of trial in absentia and allowed prosecution to make its case before the indictees were arrested. There is also ICJ case where Srebrenica is only a drop in the bucket.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Care to expand? The article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Genocide_8469.html" title="Bosnian Genocide">Bosnian Genocide</a> gives only a broad definition, and then proceeds to tell the facts about Srebrenica Genocide and allusions that other cases <i>might</i> have <i>potential</i> to become accepted as genocide: "Statistics may change as these and other cases ... develop", "He warned that attempting this process would amount to genocide." etc. There is also article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_genocide_case_at_the_ICJ_0d41.html" title="Bosnian genocide case at the ICJ">Bosnian genocide case at the ICJ</a> where Bosnian PoV about the issue <b>should</b> be presented; however, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Genocide_8469.html" title="Bosnian Genocide">Bosnian Genocide</a> article states it as a fact.

<p>Bosnian Genocide article presents only those elements as facts that have been proven at the ICTY ie. Srebrenica Massacre. Bosnian Genocide as a subject goes beyond the case of genocide that took place in Srebrenica and presents other cases that are dealing with this complex issue. What Duja is attempting to do here is to conceal the matter of genocide as only pertaining to Srebrenice and make a quick conclusion and closure, while the scope of it is at a very least disputed and claimed by many to be much broader. The article presents several indictments at ICTY against individuals for crimes in the whole region of BiH and the case BiH vs SCG at the ICJ while not jumping to conclusion that these cases can yet be considered as facts. Although the articles are related I see no reason to merge the two.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 21:41, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I were trying to make a quick conclusion and closure of anything, I would edit the article, AfD it or whatever. I just added tags, and raised my concerns on the talk pages. If, as you say "The article presents several indictments at ICTY against individuals ", then the title of the article should read "Indictments of genocide in Bosnia", and it should not start with words "Bosnian Genocide is killing of Bosniaks.". If the "scope of the term is much broader", then the article should <b>mention</b> that its scope is <b>disputed</b>. And it has a PoV title from the start. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 22:17, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, point by point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro: <i>The Bosnian Genocide or Bosnia Genocide was killing of Bosnians...by the army and police forces organized by Republika Srpska.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Who</b> uses the term "Bosnian Genocide" in that sense apart from Bosnian government circles and some Bosniaks? Genocide is a too big a word to be used so easily. Ethnic cleansing? Yes. Crimes against humanity? Yes. Genocide? Maybe, but not proven.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>The Bosnian Genocide is a term used by some... when referring to the case of genocide that took place in Srebrenica, which has been proven..."</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This instance of genocide is proven, so merge it to <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>There are several genocide trials and indictments... Statistics <b>may (emphasis mine)</b> change as these and other cases develop.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>In addition ... there is an ongoing court case before the International Court of Justice a so called Bosnian genocide case at the ICJ.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is indeed. So, the "Bosnian genocide" is not a proven term, but a point of dispute and a trial.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>US House of Representatives resolution.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I admit this has certain merit, though it's not binding for US Government. And also, bear in mind that this is a political statement.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I won't go further. Note that I'm not objecting about the <b>factual accuracy</b> of the article, but just one-sided presentation of those facts. Most of all, I object to the title, which presumes proof of existence of the Genocide (apart from Srebrenica one, again). I'd prefer instead War crimes in Bosnia, or, if you insist, Serb war crimes in Bosnia, Croat war crimes in Bosnia and Bosniak war crimes in Bosnia. At this point, this article looks like a part of Bosnian case over ICJ more than an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 21:40, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I have presented several links where the use of the term is shown in relation to Srebrenica massacre but also in relation to the ICTY cases such as "Milosevic to Face Bosnian Genocide Charges". I see no problem with the title as it correctly points out that there is judicial debate about the genocide conducted on the entire region of BiH. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 17:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I was speaking from a POV I would state numerous Bosniak sources that take the crimes commited in BiH as definite genocide based on the Genocide Convention from 1949. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 17:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Let me remind that this is a debate if articles should be merged but so far you have only argued the content of the article. Since you have not commented on the fact that the article takes in account other genocide cases and deserves a separate stub to review those cases I don't see any other reason to merge these articles.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 17:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But if you take out Srebrenica facts, what remains? Only few hints, as I said above. That's why I suggested to merge it there. Don't take my "merge" as a definite proposal—but when I stumbled upon this collection of factoids, I didn't know myself what would I do with it. Merge is one option. Rewrite from scratch another. Delete third (I know it wouldn't pass an AfD so why bother). The title is IMO a bombastic POV, and the substance is incoherent.</dd>
<dd>Look, I support the idea that war crimes in Bosnian War should be summarized at one place, even if solely Serbs' war crimes. But this article <b>does not have a focus</b> on anything. If I may summarize it in few words, it goes like:</dd>
<dd>"Bosnian Genocide is commited by RS against Bosniaks. Some people refer Srebrenica by that name. Srebrenica genocide is confirmed by ICTY. There might be other cases of genocide sentences. Americans said this. Karadzic and Mladic said that." All of it are <b>hints</b> – there is no substance, no story.</dd>
<dd>If you want to have my opinion: go ahead and create a summary article about war crimes in Bosnia. Give it a less bombastic title. Mention every case of war crime and ethnic cleansing. But, for God's sake, don't create articles like "I'd-like-to-have-this-title-but-I-don't-know-what-to-put-in-there". And yes, this time I'm willing to help on it (as long as you decide <b>what you want to write about</b>). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 18:03, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I agree that the article is a bit all over the place particulary due to different styles of many users who have changed it.</p>
<p>But, let's have all the facts in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to ICTY Srebrenica massacre was a genocide</li>
<li>Many academic and human rights institutions name that genocide a Bosnian genocide.</li>
<li>According to ICTY many war crimes particulary against non-Serbs have been committed on the entire region of Bosnia and Herzegovina</li>
<li>Bosniak and few other sides (US House of Rep.) consider those crimes as collectively being part of the larger Bosnian genocide intent in line with the definition of genocide and based on Genocide Convention of 1949.</li>
<li>Serbian side either denies that there was a genocide (both in Srebrenica or in BiH) or it accepts that it only happened in Srebrenica.</li>
<li>There is a court case at ICJ ongoing where BiH is accusing SCG and its surrogate RS of Bosnian genocide on the entire region of BiH.</li>
<li>There is also at least one case (Krajisnik) before the ICTY that also stipulates genocide on the entire region of BiH.</li>
<li>There is at least inconclusive trial of Milosevic that brought to light many facts about what can be considered a Bosnian genocide on the entire region of BiH.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we were to take only first two points here than you would be right to claim to merge this article with Srebrenica massacre article and I would agree with you. However, the debate is obviously much more complex than that so merge has no merit. Another option to name Srebrenica massacre - Srebrenica genocide would be a possibility but there are common points among these fact that rightfully justify the name of this article as Bosnian Genocide. We can pursue rewriting the article based on these facts. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 19:07, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For once I agree with PaxEquilibrium. As he says, "the controversy of its 'factual existence' should be explained in the article", but the article should not be deleted. The events that occured throughout the country from 1992 to 1995 are still considered genocide by many (nearly every organization devoted to the study of genocide, numerous human rights organization, the vice-president of the international court as outlined in his dissenting opinion, the United States government, a number of Serb/Montenegrin academics and intellectuals, a long list of academic institutions, etc.) and as such deserves its own article seperate of the Srebrenica massacre. Certainly, in light of the ruling, it should be noted just that: the International Court of Justice ruled 11-4 that the genocide was limited to Srebrenica. However, merging the article into the Srebrenica massacre would unjustly submerge the far from marginal opinion that genocide occured throughout Bosnia - from Srebrenica to Prijedor. After all, the ICJ has still essentially reaffirmed the ICTY's ruling that the actus reus of genocide occured throughout Bosnia, and that deserves an appropriate explanation. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 22:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'm against the "classic" merge; this article was started as (what I believe was) a <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">User:Dado</a>'s POV-fork from <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_Genocide&amp;oldid=10857685" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_Genocide&amp;oldid=10857685" rel="nofollow">first rev</a>). However, it was fairly well sourced from the outset and kept on topic of the controversy of the opinions whether the entire Bosnian war should be considered genocide. The main reason, however, is that <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> is already way too long. Currently, at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Talk%7ESrebrenica_massacre_a3df.html" title="Talk:Srebrenica massacre">Talk:Srebrenica massacre</a> there's a heated debate on inclusion and characterization of "alternative/revisionist/denialist" views.</p>
<p>I propose something along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename this article to Bosnian genocide controversy, Bosnian genocide debate (or something similar)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I support renaming it Bosnian genocide controversy, while explaining that genocide is officially established in Srebrenica (thus linking to that article), and officially declared as non-existent outside of Srebrenica (which is where the controversy arises from) <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 22:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm surprised that you describe the existence of the Trnopolje camp as spanning a "few years". It closed in August 1992, almost as soon as its existence and nature was revealedn to the outside world. In any case while the brutal but intermittent murders at Trnopolje might not be classed as a "massacre", how would you describe the systematic killings at Omarska? --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 15:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't read carefully the entire article; the intro said 1992-1995, but it referred to the entire war, not the <a href="../../../t/r/n/Trnopolje_camp.html" title="Trnopolje camp">Trnopolje camp</a> itself. My understanding of the word is that it describes a one-off event, not something that spanned 4 months, like Omarska. Perhaps I was nit-picking; according to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">massacre</a> article: "A massacre shall be considered the execution of five or more people, in the same place, as part of the same operation and whose victims were in an indefensible state." — it doesn't mention the exact time span. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 15:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"<i>In more than 10 years of activity, the tribunal has so far found that <b>genocide occurred solely in Srebrenica</b>.

<dd>I watched the ruling. I listened to the judge specifically say that evidence did NOT support genocide outside of Srebrenica.

<p>No Maitresse, you'll find that at para 219 of the judgment it refers to the fact that the ICTY found in the Krajisnik case that the actus reus (the fact) of genocide (of the Bosnian Muslims of Eastern Bosnia) was proven. However (and I found that decision difficult to understand but that was the decision) the intent on Krajisnik's part - the mens rea - was not proven. So the fact of genocide occurred in the municipalities named but no-one was convicted on the charge, and that presumably was why the genocide in Bosnia could not be submitted to proceedings aimed at determining legal responsibility. Para 219 below:</p>
<p>"219. The accused does have a role at the fourth stage - motions for acquittal made by the defence at the end of the prosecution’s case and after the defence has had the opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, on the basis that “there is no evidence capable of supporting a conviction”. This stage is understood to require a decision, not that the Chamber trying the facts would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution’s evidence (if accepted), but rather that it could be so satisfied (Jelisić, IT-95-10-A, Appeals Chamber Judgment, 5 July 2001, para. 37). The significance of that lesser standard for present purposes appears from one case on which the Applicant relied. The Trial Chamber in August 2005 in Krajišnik dismissed the defence motion that the accused who was charged with genocide and other crimes had no case to answer (IT-00-39-T, transcript of 19 August 2005, pp. 17112-17132). But following the full hearing the accused was found not guilty of genocide nor of complicity in genocide. While the actus reus of genocide was established, the specific intent (dolus specialis) was not (Trial Chamber Judgment, 27 September 2006, paras. 867-869). Because the judge or the Chamber does not make definitive findings at any of the four stages described, the Court does not consider that it can give weight to those rulings. The standard of proof which the Court requires in this case would not be met."</p>
<p>So please do not say that genocide was not committed elsewhere in Bosnia. It was. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 00:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry Opbeith, but as Judge Higgins clearly stated "<b>specific intent to destroy a group that is the required proof of genocide</b>". Therefore, genocide was not proven. To make such a claim, you need proof for it. But good effort on your part, your really spend a lot of time looking for documents, keep up the good work. :) <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 00:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe this will help, Opbeith. It is the definition of "<b>genocide</b>":</p>
<p>"Genocide is the mass killing of a group of people as defined by Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) as "<i>any of the following acts <b>committed with intent</b> to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group</i>, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."</p>
<p>The definition of genocide shows that genocide itself is the <b>intent to destroy a group through harmful acts</b> (murder etc.). Without the intent, those acts simply become ACTS (ex: murders, deportations). <a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/User%7EMa%C3%AEtresse_78d1.html" title="User:Maîtresse"><font color="DeepPink"><i>Maîtresse</i></font></a> 00:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maitresse, though you are right, I still think it's quite notable that international courts have found the actus reus of genocide to have been committed - especially in light of the great criticism to the court's ruling due to unavailability of key evidence and the high standard of proof. That is to say, the court's approach to determining intent is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the ruling - by international law academics, human rights officials from serbia and elsewhere, etc. I'd urge you to read vice president of the court Al-Khasawneh's dissent <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/cdocket/cbhy/cbhyjudgments/cbhy_cjudgment_20070226/dissenting_opinion_vice_president.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/cdocket/cbhy/cbhyjudgments/cbhy_cjudgment_20070226/dissenting_opinion_vice_president.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> to gain a better understanding of what I mean. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 17:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>No one is arguing that controversy doesn't exist. It does exist, just as it does with the ruling that Srebrenica itself was genocide, or the scope of the massacre etc. (which is what everyone's been arguing about on the Srebrenica page.. quite the boiling pot heh). However, controversy is not enough to simply say "do not say that genocide was not committed elsewhere in Bosnia. It was." (as opbeith did) Proof is required. But the proof was not provided. (intent, people, intent!)</li>
<li>And I no longer think this article should be merged with Srebrenica because the case for genocide in Bosnia does contain many controversies (both for and against) which should be explained here (in which case as Duja pointed out, the article's name should be changed to Bosnian genocide controversy, or something similar).</li>
<li>That paragraph which Opbeith posted is contradictory. The 'actus reus' of genocide is absolutely meaningless without the intent. The 'actus reus' then simply become 'massacres', 'deportations' etc., which is PRECISELY WHY the court ruled against genocide. It's getting kind of tiring repeating why the court ruled against genocide (outside Srebrenica), they did so for a reason. I have stated that reason (both with a definition of genocide and with a direct quote from a Hague judge) so that is settled.</li>
<li>With regard to the link you provided, could you please point out which part you wanted me to read (with regard to genocide outside of Srebrenica), thanks a lot.</li>

<p>Could you provide a reference in the ICJ's decision for your statement that "Camps were officially declared by Judge Higgins as not genocide"? The Court might have found that the role of the camps in the genocide hadn't been proven within the timeframe of reference for its judgment but since the ethnic cleansing of Prijedor municipality is the subject of extant charges of genocide it seems unlikely the ICJ would preempt the ICTY's consideration of those charges by making such a definitive finding. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 09:53, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maitresse, Mladic and Karadzic are still indicted on charges of genocide applicable throughout Bosnia. The relevant information about their indictments is very easily accessible at the ICTY website. To save you the trouble of looking for information I have copied the relevant details below.</p>
<p><br />
From the Mladic indictment at <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
COUNTS 1 and 2 GENOCIDE, COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE</p>
<p><br />
By his acts and omissions, General Ratko MLADIC participated in:</p>
<p><br />
Count 1: GENOCIDE, punishable under Articles 4(3)(a), 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal;</p>
<p><br />
Count 2: COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE, punishable under Articles 4(3)(e), 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal.</p>
<p><br />
32. From no later than 12 May 1992 until at least 22 December 1996, General Ratko MLADIC, acting individually or in concert with other participants in the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation or execution of the intentional partial destruction of the Bosnian Muslim national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such, from Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.</p>
<p><br />
33. As alleged in paragraphs 20 to 26, General Ratko MLADIC participated in a joint criminal enterprise. The main objective of the joint criminal enterprise was primarily achieved through a manifest pattern of persecutions as alleged in this indictment. This campaign of persecutions included or escalated to include conduct committed with the intent to destroy in part the national, ethnical, racial or religious group of Bosnian Muslims, as such, in certain municipalities within BiH. Bosnian Serb Forces under the command and control of General Ratko MLADIC targeted a significant part of the Bosnian Muslim group for intended destruction. This form of partial destruction of the Bosnian Muslims took place in Banja Luka, Bosanska Krupa, Bratunac, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</p>
<p><br />
34. The destruction of these groups was effected by:</p>
<p>1. the widespread killing, deportation, and forcible transfer of non-Serbs during and after the attacks on Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Sanski Most, and Srebrenica. Bosnian Muslims were killed and hundreds of thousands deported or forcibly transferred in furtherance of the 1992 and 1993 "ethnic cleansing" campaigns in the Bosnian Krajina and in eastern Bosnia. These killings include those in Banja Luka, Bosanska Krupa, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor and Sanski Most specified in Schedule A. In eastern Bosnia, a large segment of the Bosnian Muslim population was driven into the area of Cerska-Kamenica and then ultimately routed to Tuzla and Srebrenica. After the fall of Srebrenica, thousands of Bosnian Muslim males were executed in Bratunac, Srebrenica, Vlasenica and Zvornik in an organised and systematic fashion over the course of several days, an event which occurred contemporaneously with the forcible transfer of the remainder of the Bosnian Muslim community of Srebrenica. These killings include those specified in Schedule B;</p>
<p>2. the causing of serious bodily or mental harm to Bosnian Muslims in Banja Luka, Bosanska Krupa, Bratunac, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Vlasenica and Zvornik, including during their confinement in the detention facilities in Banja Luka, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor and Sanski Most specified in Schedule C. Bosnian Muslims in these municipalities were subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment, including torture, physical and psychological abuse, sexual violence and beatings;</p>
<p>3. the subjecting of Bosnian Muslims to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction, namely through cruel and inhumane treatment, including torture, physical and psychological abuse and sexual violence, inhumane living conditions, and forced labour, in Banja Luka, Bosanska Krupa, Bratunac, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Vlasenica and Zvornik. In addition, in the detention facilities in Banja Luka, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor and Sanski Most specified in Schedule C, the conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Bosnian Muslims also included the failure to provide adequate accommodation, shelter, food, water, medical care or hygienic sanitation facilities.</p>
<p><br />
35. From no later than 12 May 1992 until at least 22 December 1996, General Ratko MLADIC knew or had reason to know that the crimes alleged in paragraphs 32 to 34 above were about to be committed or had been committed by his subordinates, and he failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or punish the perpetrators thereof.</p>

17. Between 1 July 1991 and 31 December 1992, acting individually or in concert with others, including Momcilo KRAJISNIK and Biljana PLAVSIC, and between early March 1995 and 30 November 1995, acting individually or in concert with others, Radovan KARADZIC; planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation or execution of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat national, ethnical, racial or religious groups, as such, in several municipalities, including but not limited to: Bijeljina; Bratunac; Bosanski Samac; Brcko; Doboj; Foca; Ilijas; Kljuc; Kotor Varos; Novi Grad; Prijedor; Rogatica; Sanski Most; Srebrenica; Visegrad; Vlasenica; Zavidovici; and Zvornik. The destruction of these groups in these municipalities was effected by:</p>
<p>1. the killing of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats which took place during and after the attacks on and within the municipalities; the killing of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats in and after they had been taken away from camps and detention facilities; and the killing of Bosnian Muslims after their captivity in several different locations in and around the Srebrenica enclave;</p>
<p>2. the causing of serious bodily or mental harm to Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during their confinement in camps and detention facilities, and during their interrogations at these locations, police stations and military barracks, where detainees were continuously subjected to, or forced to witness, inhumane acts including murder, sexual violence, torture, beatings and robbery; and</p>
<p>3. the detention of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats in camps and detention facilities under conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of those national, ethnical, racial or religious groups, as such, more fully set out in Paragraph 30. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 12:45, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
