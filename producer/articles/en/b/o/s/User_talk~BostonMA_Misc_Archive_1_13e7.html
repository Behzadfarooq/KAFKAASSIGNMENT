<p>First of all, I want to thank you for your comments in various disputes in which I have been involved here recently. I should have responded more quickly, but I wanted to couple my thanks to my response to your request for input on the proposed "Bill of Rights." My response (which has ended up being a full-length, extensive and extensively revised draft proposal) took much longer than I had anticipated to complete. I'm placing the draft on the talk page of the "Bill of Rights"/User prerogatives proposal; I hope you find it useful in continuing/reopening the discussion. If you think another location would be more suitable, please feel free to move it wherever you see fit.

<dd>The point is, there is a difference between vadalism and a Content Dispute! We are having a dispute over the content of an article. It is not vandalism, now, the source you have added quotes figures of 30 and 80 [[Lakh], significantly less than what you are using it as a reference for. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 15:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You keep deleting that it is the largest religious gathering on earth. Do you dispute this? Estimates of the crowd size vary, as estimates in that range necessarily must. If you would like to say that the crowd was <i>estimated</i> to be such and such, that is fine. Or, if you would like to say that estimates of the number of people range from x to y, that is also fine. Deleting the fact that it is the largest religious gather on earth, (according to some, the largest gathering on earth of any type), well that is not fine. That fact is well documented by reputable sources, and deleting it, unless you sincerely believe that it may be in error, is, I'm afraid vandalism. Don't do it. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 15:42, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care about that, altough it being in bold is against policy, but you kept reverting it back in. You keep adding this figure of seventy million, but that was added as specultion prior to the event. You allowed it to be viewed as tough only hindus were present, despite a cited BBC article reporting on India using the event to attract (non-Hindu) tourists. Your article reports as tough these "70 million" people were all present at the one time, despite each of the articles cited referring to it being an event which lasts over one month. Again, this is a content dispute, and the one not assuming good faith here, really, is you. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 15:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are correct, I am not assuming good faith. I came to the conclusion that you were not acting in good faith. If you would like me to assume good faith again, please answer me these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you doubt that this was the largest religious gathering in the world?</li>
<li>Do you doubt that being the largest religious gathering in the world is a notable fact that is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia?</li>
<li>Do you doubt that Wikipedia would be negatively impacted if this information is removed?</li>
</ul>
<p>As for your other comments, it is not "my" article. It is Wikipedia's article and it was written by many editors, most of them not myself. If you would like to have a genuine discussion about shortcomings that may appear in the article, you are welcome to start such a discussion, although I suggest that you begin in the article talk page and not here in my user talk page. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 16:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry. I believe that you understand that it is a fact that Kumbh Mela has been the largest religious gathering in the world. I also believe that you understand that Wikipedia would be harmed by the removal of such facts. Putting these together, I believe that your removal of this fact amounted to vandalism. If you want me to assume good faith, you need to address these issues. You began this thread because I posted several <i>test</i> templates on your talk page. You are now asking me to treat your edits as a simple content dispute. There are undoubtedly genuine content issues worthy of discussion. However, I will not treat your edits <i>solely</i> as a content dispute, because I believe they constituted vandalism. If that bothers you, you may address the concerns I have expressed. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 17:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm editing a section of the word <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planet</a> in the English Wikipedia and was thinking of adding a brief mention of the Indian names for the planets and their origins. However I am a bit confused. I know there are many languages in India, but do they all use the same <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navagraha.html" title="Navagraha">Navagraha</a>-based names for the planets?

<dd>Thank you for your reply; yes that was helpful, but I was also wondering if what they denoted (ie, the gods) was the same, regardless of language, in much the same way that the countries of east Asia use the five Chinese elements to identify the planets, even if their own respective words for them may be different. And would that be true for Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the other countries of the Indian subcontinent as well? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerendipodous_1fa9.html" title="User:Serendipodous">Serendipodous</a> 08:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Instead of renaming it, you may want to try a re-direct. It is not wrong to call it an NGO, but somehow it doesn't resemble typical Indian NGOs; let it remain.

<p>Hi! In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with having an article titled <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> that categorises people based on their profession. The same has been done at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hindus_9deb.html" title="List of Hindus">List of Hindus</a>. In these articles, the focus is to highlight prominent people who are followers of the religion. Hence, a categorisation is required to assert their prominence. The sub listings can be justified per <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. However, it is unnecessary to have such a classification via a cateogry. There are already categories for Hindus as well as for athletes. So a further classification as Hindu atheletes is unwarrented; and if need, can be accessed using the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_intersection_86ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Category intersection">category intersection</a> functions.<br />
And yes, Kerala is a place that surprises me by its beauty even today, despite having lived here all my life.

<dd>I apologise for the delay. I have decided not to push in the cfd debate any further, as I'm not interested in sacrificing my integrity, and be branded as a <i>pseudo-secularist</i> by certain users. I do, however, owe you a reply.

<p><i>You to me</i>: Hi Bhadani, could you semi-protect this page, as well as September 12, and 10. If that is not possible I understand. However, there is a sockpuppet who has voted multiple times, was blocked, and he keeps removing the notices that he is a sockpuppet, by using what I strongly suspect are new sockpuppet accounts. Your help is greatly appreciated. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 02:13, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>My response</i>:These pages are highly visible pages, and no nonsense may continue unnoticed long by others. In case, some one is really a sockpuppet, he/shall gets exposed sooner than later.

<p>Hi Bhadani, I have been working on <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri_river.html" title="Kaveri river">Kaveri river</a> to get some facts and figures into the article about usage of the river. One of the issues that I face is that the many references use differing units, millions of acre-feet, mega-liters per day, cubic feet per hour etc. I was wondering whether it is appropriate to convert these to a single common unit for the benefit of the reader? Have you come across this issue before? What are your thoughts? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 14:47, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, you might want to put the article in your watchlist and monitor it.

If you could participate in some of the issues that I have raised on the talk page and monitor the article for vandalism etc then I would be extremely grateful. Please do consider doing so as it would mean a lot to me to have this article achieve a modicum of credibility.

<p>Yeah, I re-read what I wrote and realized that what I wrote could be taken in so many horrible ways, none of which I intended. There's definitely a reason that Muslim contributors might find the use of the "Western" A.D. on an article on their most revered prophet, and I think that was relevant to the discussion, but there were clearly non-Muslim participants in the discussion who also preferred C.E. I realized that what I wrote might be seen to imply some sort of nefarious motives on the part of our Muslim contributors, which was far from my intention. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 05:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bhadani, I notice that your recent edits seem to indicate some distress. I wish for your peace of mind. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> on 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thank you. It is not distress. It is sadness that despite a lot of collective efforts, we are unable to deliver the results. Anyway, man proposes and God disposes! --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 16:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

According to it's results Muslim constituted 138,188,240 or 13.4% of the population in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. The figures in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_by_country.html" title="Islam by country">Islam by country</a> are incorrect and they quote unreliable sources and webpages.

Most people quote India's state <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> percentage where Muslim constitute 18.5% of the population. According to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_India_eac4.html" title="Demographics of India">Demographics of India</a>, India's population is 1.125 billion in 2006 <a href="http://www.prb.org/pdf06/06WorldDataSheet.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prb.org/pdf06/06WorldDataSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, so 13.4% would be 150,321,200.
