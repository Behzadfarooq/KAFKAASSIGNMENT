<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Herald_f08a.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Daily Advertiser</i> was established in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a> in Boston by Nathan Hale. The paper grew to prominence through the 19th century taking over other Boston area papers. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called <i>The American</i>. Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. By <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> had changed to the <i>Daily Record</i>, and <i>The American</i> had become the <i>Sunday Advertiser</i>. A third paper owned by Hearst, called the <i>Afternoon Record</i>, which had been renamed the <i>Evening American</i>, merged in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> with the <i>Daily Record</i> to form the <i>Record American</i>. The <i>Sunday Advertiser</i> and <i>Record American</i> would ultimately be merged in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> into a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old <i>Boston Herald</i>.</p>
<p>The old <i>Boston Herald</i> was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a> by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French &amp; Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, William O. Eaton, just 22 years old, said "The <i>Herald</i> will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global."</p>
<p>Even earlier than the <i>Herald</i>, the <i>Boston Traveler</i> was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a> as a bulletin for <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach">stagecoach</a> listings. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, the <i>Herald</i> acquired the <i>Traveler</i>, and after a newspaper strike in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon <i>Traveler</i> to create the <i>Boston Herald Traveler</i>, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, the <i>Herald Traveler</i> organization acquired Boston radio station <a href="../../../w/e/e/WEEI_ebe6.html" title="WEEI">WHDH</a>. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/d/WHDH-TV_fca4.html" title="WHDH-TV">WHDH-TV</a> made its début as an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years under temporary authority from the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive had with an FCC commissioner during the original licensing process (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse the <i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a></i> of being covertly behind the proceeding. The <i>Herald Traveler</i> was Republican in sympathies, and the <i>Globe</i> was allied with <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_political_family.html" title="Kennedy political family">Kennedy family</a> interests, although at the time of the licensing dispute, the <i>Globe</i> had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates, and the proceedings regarding the WHDH-TV license were initiated long before John F. Kennedy was elected president.). The FCC ordered a comparative hearing, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> a competing applicant, Boston Broadcasters, Inc. was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. The <i>Herald Traveler</i> fought the decision in court -- by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat -- but its final appeal ran out in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a> WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new <a href="../../../w/c/v/WCVB-TV_177d.html" title="WCVB-TV">WCVB-TV</a>.</p>
<p>Without a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the <i>Herald Traveler</i> was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearst_Corporation_9d44.html" title="Hearst Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a>, which published the rival all-day newspaper the <i>Record American</i>. The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the <i>Boston Herald-Traveler and Record American</i> in the morning and "Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler" in the afternoon. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to <i>Boston Herald American</i>. The paper became a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> newspaper in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, the paper was purchased by Rupert Murdoch, who changed its name back to the <i>Boston Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i> continued to grow over the ensuing decades, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until the early 21st century, when circulation and advertising revenue dropped -- part of a phenomenon affecting almost all American newspapers in an expanding age of free media. The paper retrenched into its "Record American" roots and was retooled as a more sensationalist publication on the hope that boosting street sales would keep the paper alive.</p>

<p>In February <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Murdoch's <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a> was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Television_Network_a73e.html" title="Fox Television Network">Fox Television Network</a> could legally consummate its purchase of <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> affiliate <a href="../../../w/f/x/WFXT-TV_95e7.html" title="WFXT-TV">WFXT</a> (Channel 25). Patrick Purcell, who was the publisher of the <i>Boston Herald</i> and a <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a> executive, purchased the <i>Herald</i> and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the <i>Herald</i> a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_Newspaper_Company_abfe.html" title="Community Newspaper Company">Community Newspaper Company</a> from <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidelity_Investments_c93c.html" title="Fidelity Investments">Fidelity Investments</a>. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.</p>
<p>After years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the <i>Herald</i>, Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to <a href="../../../g/a/t/GateHouse_Media_7a89.html" title="GateHouse Media">GateHouse Media</a>. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Patriot_Ledger_ad7f.html" title="The Patriot Ledger">The Patriot Ledger</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Enterprise_%28Brockton%29_8cca.html" title="The Enterprise (Brockton)">The Enterprise</a></i> in south suburban <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy%2C_Massachusetts_6c46.html" title="Quincy, Massachusetts">Quincy</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brockton%2C_Massachusetts_865b.html" title="Brockton, Massachusetts">Brockton</a>, netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the <i>Herald</i>'s debt and reinvest in the tabloid.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
