<p>Wikipedia policy permits any material added to Wikipedia to be challenged, by making a request for verifiable sources. If a verifiable source, meeting certain requirements is not produced, the material in question may be deleted. Not all sources qualify as a response to such a challenge. The Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> specifically mentions the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Self-published sources</b> - Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information on the professional researcher's blog is really worth reporting, someone else will have done so.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As mediator, I will ask whether any of websites with which the parties are associated is controlled by a well-known professional in the relevant field. By a professional in a field, I understand someone who is recognized as a professional in the field by others, for example by being hired as such by an employer, or by the awarding of advanced degrees in the field by a University.</p>
<p>It is the mediators opinion that if a statement in Wikipedia is challenged for a verifiable source, and the source offered is a website not controlled by a well-known professional in the appropriate field, then the challenge should be considered to have not been met. The statement in Wikipedia may be deleted. Please note, that the question of whether an article may link to a given website is another matter altogether. The opinion here relates only to whether certain material may be deleted because that material has not been supported by suitable sources.</p>
<p>Please express your agreement or disagreement with this opinion. <b>Please discuss other issues elsewhere</b>. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 03:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please point out to the mediator any Wikipedia policies or guidelines which you believe are relevent to the issues of when it is appropriate or inappropriate to include a link within any part of a Wikipedia article (including 'external links') to a personal website or a website which is not controlled by a professional in the appropriate field.

<p>The mediator is not familiar with any Wikipedia policies or guidelines which address the issues of when it is appropriate or inappropriate to include a link within any part of a Wikipedia article (including 'external links') to a personal website or a website which is not controlled by a professional in the appropriate field. The mediator understand this as a different issue than the question of using websites as a verifiable source. The mediator made a request to the parties to point out to any such relevent policies or guidelines, but to date, no such policies or guidelines have been brought forward. Wikipedia may not have such policies or guidelines. The Mediator believes that in the absense of knowledge of such policies or guidelines, the merits of having links to (personal etc.) websites should be evaluated on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>SSS108, I have been pondering the question of links to websites. I am not asking you to do this work now, but if it should become necesssary, would you be willing to host the various documents which are currently on the opponents sites on your own site? The documents I refer to are those that may be properly used as sources on Wikipedia. Would you be willing to host them in such a way that they are segregated from your other material. That is, a page containing the document would contain just the document, nothing else, and no links to other pages? Please let me know if that is something you would be able or willing to do. --BostonMA 17:04, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely, BostonMA. I already offered to this in the past. I'd provide the references within no framed pages, without any links to my site and without personal comments. SSS108 talk-email 18:05, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Andries, if SSS108 were to host various documents that are also hosted on sites critical of SSS, and if those documents are on pages which are segregated from the rest of his site, such that they contain only those documents and no links, would you have any objections to the links in the article being changed to point to those pages on SSS108's site? --BostonMA 19:30, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will think about it. It will be clear that I intensely dislike SSS108's website for various reasons that I have abundantly made clear. Andries 19:33, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>And I, similarly, intensely dislike Andries and Anti-Sai Activist's websites for various reasons I made abundantly clear. Unlike Anti-Sai Sites, the references on my site would have not links that go to my main page. Nor would it have personal comments. Less Bias = More Good. To get a better idea of the page I would be using, here it is (I would simply insert the text): Proof-Plate Also, if the pages are "pointed" to my site, they can, at any moment be changed back to "point" to Anti-Sai Sites. Again, notice the trend of Anti-Sai Activists to maintain control over the information. Why? SSS108 talk-email 20:26, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_Mediation_Sathya_Sai_Baba_Use_of_Websites_f13c.html" title="Edit section: Do External Links Constitute Sources per Wikipedia Guidelines/Policies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Do External Links Constitute <b>Sources</b> per Wikipedia Guidelines/Policies</span></h2>
<p>A number of Wikipedia policies and guidelines address the use of websites as sources. An issue arises as to whether all links to websites appearing in Wikipedia articles are <b>sources</b> (per those policies and guidelines). In particular, are links within an <b>External Links</b> section sources, and must they meet the requirements of sources? The mediator's understanding of <b>sources</b>, as in <b>verifiable sources</b> or <b>reputable sources</b> refers to "sources for information which is included in an article". These sources may be referenced in the article, but it is not a requirement that they be referenced. It is only a requirement that they be "produced", or an editor may remove the content in question is inadequately sourced. If the sources for an article need not actually appear in the article, it would seem that the converse (I'm not sure of my logic terms here) might also be true, that a reference appearing in the article is not necessarily a <b>source</b> (as meant by the policies and guidelines), but may merely be a reference. Such references might be present merely for the convenience of users of the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Please express your opinion regarding whether links within Wikipedia articles always constitute <b>sources</b> and need to meet the requirements of <b>sources</b> per policies/guidelines. Please discuss other issues elsewhere. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 14:22, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>SSS108: Links located in the "External Links Section", in my opinion, do not constitute "sources" and can be cited in that section only. Information, in the body of the article that is referenced with external links, should not be linked to personal homepages, biased homepages or homepages that are non-notable. They need to be referenced from notable sources (on neutral, original websites when available). With the exception of blue links in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, I agree that all external links or referenced links need to meet the requirements of <i>"sources"</i> per policies/guidelines. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 18:56, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thaumaturgic: Agree. References and sources need to be linked to neutral, reputable sites, but linking is not mandatory. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 03:52, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Andries: There is a difference between a source, a reference, and an external link. The source is essential and has to be reputable if a statement in the article is voiced as a fact. The reference is the connection between the statement and the source. References should include ext. links, (not just a book title and page nr.), if available because they greatly help the readers. If the source is available on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">website</a> of the original publisher then we externally link to their website. For example we should link the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webpage.html" title="Webpage">webpage</a> of the BBC containing the transcript of the <i>Seduced documentary</i> If the source information is not available on the website of the original publisher then we should link to the webpage of exbaba, saiguru, or Moreno. Placing a small number of external links in the external links section is a somewhat different matter and there is no need for such high level of the quality of the sources. Webpages already linked to as part of a reference in the article should not be repeated in external link section as per policy and guidelines. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I disagree with Andries statement for the reasons already expressed earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BostonMA/Mediation/Sathya_Sai_Baba/Use_of_Websites#Discussion_About_External_Links_.26_Personal_Homepages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BostonMA/Mediation/Sathya_Sai_Baba/Use_of_Websites#Discussion_About_External_Links_.26_Personal_Homepages" rel="nofollow">Reference</a> If the source information is not available, it should be placed on Wikipedia's site and should <b>not</b> be linked to either Pro/Anti sites. Publishing the references on Pro/Anti sites is direct solicitation of one's personal website. Since the websites in question are clearly biased, they are not supposed to be referenced as per Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. It is upto Andries to show us the policy that states otherwise. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 22:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The policy is clear on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Personal_websites_as_secondary_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Personal_websites_as_secondary_sources" rel="nofollow">personal websites as secondary sources</a>. The biased, personal website of Andries is linked to repeatedly and seems to clearly violate this policy. Moreno's website should not be referenced and neither should Andries site. As a matter of fact, Andries has been arguing against the inclusion of Moreno's site and I am surprised that Andries is now changing his tune, saying that it is okay to link to sites that both oppose and favor Sathya Sai Baba, including Moreno's site. For the past few months, Andries has argued quite the opposite. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 04:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thaumaturgic, I think that you had misunderstood me. I do not think that I changed my opinion on this. I oppose using Moreno's personal opinions on his website as a source. It will be clear that I do not like Moreno's website but to exclude it from the external link section based on my personal preference is something, I now see as wrong. I do not think that in general linking to exbaba violates policy. Sometimes it <i>can</i> violate policy, but I tried to make clear when linking is recommendable. Please try to understand the difference between <i>sources</i>, <i>references</i>, <i>external links in references</i>, and <i>external links in the external links section</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 08:44, 18 February 2006 (UTC) (amended)</dd>

<dd>Again and again your confuse sources with external links. I do not know how to make this clear to you.

<p>Nowhere does that policy state that one can link to biased, personal webpages. As a matter of fact, the policy you just stated is preceded by policies that explicitly state one cannot link to personal homepages or sites that are biased.

But even then we should proceed with great caution and should avoid relying on information from the website as a sole source. This is particularly true when the subject is controversial, or has no professional or academic standing.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Personal_websites_as_secondary_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Personal_websites_as_secondary_sources" rel="nofollow">Personal Websites As Secondary Sources</a> <i>That is, they may never be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website. Another possible exception to this rule occurs when somebody had written secondary source material that is suitable as a reference that he now refutes or corrects on his personal website, though even in this case one should be careful and try to find out the reason why the material has not been published elsewhere.</i></p>
<p><i>The reason personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial — is that they are usually created by unknown individuals who have no one checking their work. They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. It is impossible to know which is the case. Visiting a stranger's personal website is often the online equivalent of reading an unattributed flyer on a lamp post, and should be treated accordingly.</i></p>

Widely acknowledged extremist political or religious websites — for example, those belonging to Stormfront, Hamas, or the Socialist Workers Party — should never be used as sources for Wikipedia, except as primary sources i.e. in articles discussing the opinions of that organization or the opinions of a larger like-minded group, but even then should be used with great caution, and should not be relied upon as a sole source.</i></p>

<p>Once again, <i>"preferable"</i> does <b>not</b> mean it is mandatory. Especially when the "online source" happens to be partison, biased, controversial and personal.

<p>External links are web links that generally appear in a section at the very end of an article labeled "External Links". The mediator is not convinced that websites to which <i>external links</i> point, must meet the requirements of being reputable or reliable, (requirements that apply to <i>sources</i> for the body of an article). The mediator admits the possibility that he is mistaken, but observes that whether or not external links are free from such requirements, it seems to be common practice for articles on controversial subjects to have external links to POV websites. This common practice is in fact endorsed by the style guide <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> (not policy) which states in part:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>What should be linked to</b></dd>
<dd>...4. On articles with multiple Points of View, a link to sites dedicated to each, with a detailed explanation of each link. The number of links dedicated to one POV should not overwhelm the number dedicated to any other. One should attempt to add comments to these links informing the reader of their point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is the mediator's suggestion that the parties agree to abide by the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> guidelines, and particulary the section quoted, as interpretted by the mediator, at least for the time being.

<p>Web links in Wikipedia articles to sites external to Wikipedia can be a source of contention. Web links may provide a very useful service to readers and editors by furnishing convenient access to source materials. However, the web pages which include the source material, may also include material intended to promote the agenda of the site hosting those materials.</p>
<p>In the mediator's opinion, the degree to which a link to a document may be said to be assisting the promotion of an agenda not supported by Wikipedia depends upon the context in which that document appears. If the document is served on a page or pages which contain no other material, as well as no links to other material, then the promotional effect of a link to that document will be minimal.</p>
<p>The mediator proposes the following guideline. Whenever controversy arises about a link to a document being used to promote an agenda not supported by Wikipedia, if the document is also served on an alternate web page or pages, and that page or those pages contain no other material than the document itself, including no links, then the reference should link to this alternate location. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 00:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Andries: Disagree. Wikipedia should first try to link to the original publisher and if this is not possible, only then only we should apply this guideline. I do agree with this guideline if the aforementioned exception is applied first and BostonMA may have omitted unintentionally the exception in his proposal. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 16:23, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>SSS108: BostonMA. I would agree. However, the problem (as Andries rightly knows) is that all it takes is for one to remove the url extension, on the link, and one ends up back at the main index page for the biased, controversial or personal site. For example, look at Nagels article, <i>"A Guru Accused"</i>: <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/Paper%20'A%20Guru%20Accused'.html" class="external free" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/Paper%20'A%20Guru%20Accused'.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/Paper%20'A%20Guru%20Accused'.html</a> Although this page does not reload back into Andries framed site, if one removes the url extension, one is left with <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/" class="external free" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/" rel="nofollow">http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/</a> which goes back to the main index page. This is the problem with putting the references on a partison, biased, controversial or personal homepage. I'd like to note that Nagel's article is just being used as an example. We already established that this article does not meet the standards for notable references. This is the reason why Andries is hesitant to use my website for hosting the references. He knows all one needs to do is remove the url extension and my site index appears. My proposition is that we try to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Great_for_easy_access" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Great_for_easy_access" rel="nofollow">This Resource</a> or no links. Or, someone can create a tripod or yahoo site (however, these can be easily deleted if someone find the content offensive), whose name and source code do not link to or suggest, in any way, either Pro/Anti Sites. The references could be posted there as long as everyone agrees that no links to Pro/Anti Sites are put on that page and <b>only</b> the referenced text is listed without comments, links etc. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 03:05, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>SSS108, thank you for your explanation. My proposal does not prevent the parties from agreeing to a more stringent rule. For example, it doesn't prevent an agreement that documents on yahoo sites are better. It only states that if a choice is available, links should be to documents which are in context which is free from controversial links and other materials. I think this would be a step in the right direction, even if it is not perfect.</dd>
<dd>I understand the issue with shortening the URL. I do agree that it is <i>somewhat</i> of an issue. However, the point of the proposal is not to prevent curious readers from getting information about the party that is hosting the document. The point is to reduce the opportunity for editors to present controversial material to readers under the auspices of Wikipedia. My proposal doesn't do that perfectly, and there is room for improvement. However, I do think it would be a good first step. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 23:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BostonMA, if Andries agrees, I will create a free geocities site to host the references on. I would name the site something along the lines: sathyasairefs and the pages would simply contain a referenced title with referenced text. If Andries agrees, I will create the account. This way the refs are hosted on neither site and would contain no external links. There would be no way to trace this site to either Pro/Anti Sites. I think this is a fair way to deal with the problem. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 00:14, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
