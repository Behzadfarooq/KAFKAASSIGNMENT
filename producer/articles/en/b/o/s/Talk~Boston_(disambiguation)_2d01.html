<p>I find it vaguely offensive that this article states: "Boston most commonly refers to the following city: * Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.". In an American context this may be true, but historically, Boston, Lincolnshire is at least as important as its younger namesake. If I knew how it should be expressed I would give these two towns equal billing on the disambiguation page.</p>
<p>It also puzzles me that "North Boston" and "South Boston" are listed on this page, but that "New Boston" is linked to a separate page. I believe the term "North Boston" also has a specific meaning in Massachusetts, so surely they have similar status. I don't know whether that is an argument for listing the "New Boston" examples here or creating a new page for "North Boston". Maybe it is neither, but it deerves remark. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESMeeds_08ad.html" title="User:SMeeds">SMeeds</a> 18:42, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> should point to this disambiguation page, and Boston, Lincolnshire should be the first entry. See <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark.html" title="Newark">Newark</a>, which is structured in this way. How many people does it take to reach a concensus on this?

<dd>"At least as important?" No, it's not. You have no basis for such a statement, that a town with 35,000 people that most Americans have never heard of is "at least as important" as a city of over half a million that most Britons HAVE heard of. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 10:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Golbez, and I'm saying that as someone for whom the word "Boston" immediately brings to mind the place in Lincolnshire. I will slightly rearrange the disambiguation page, but there's no doubt in my mind that <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> needs to point to the US city. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 10:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, as well. I did a Google search and only found 183 thousand hits for "Boston, Lincolnshire" vs. over 47 million hits for "Boston, Massachusetts". That's 257 times as many hits. Not even close. The only people for which the two cities will have equal significance are those living in the vicinity of Lincolnshire. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 11:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...or Massachusetts. Thank you <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a>, I think that is a good solution (at least to start with). My suggestion was that <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Lincolnshire_00fb.html" title="Boston, Lincolnshire">Boston, Lincolnshire</a> was historically at least as important as <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, nothing more (however people may have misread it), a statement which I suspect is difficult to either prove or disprove - the size of the town has little to do with it. Maybe I (we) should settle for the changes now made to the disambiguoation page, though TiffaF's suggestion seemed particularly even-handed - this is meant to be an international resource. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESMeeds_08ad.html" title="User:SMeeds">SMeeds</a> 14:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was one of England's busiest ports 7-800 years ago, and has been moderately important since. I love the place, but you're basically right - it's only known outside England because of the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrim_Fathers_966e.html" title="Pilgrim Fathers">Pilgrim Fathers</a> (who sailed from Boston to the Netherlands and from there to America several years later) and Boston, Mass. being named after it.

<p>I just Googled "Boston," on google.ca, and the first reference to Boston, England, didn't come up until the 256th result. Even on google.co.uk, only one of the first 50 results refer to the English city. The Boston, Mass., area has 6.1 million people; the Boston, England, area has less than 60,000. The Boston, Mass., area is home to Harvard and MIT; one of the world's largest concentrations of biotech companies; many important historical sites; the Massachusetts state government; and the Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins and Patriots (sort of). I'm sure Boston, England, is a wonderful place, but I can't imagine that anyone outside of the immediate vicinity is thinking of it when they say "Boston." No one complains that <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> directs to the city in England, even though <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Ontario_c3a0.html" title="London, Ontario">London, Ontario</a>, is a lot bigger than Boston, England. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find it rude that when I type Boston I didn't get either the general search or Boston Massachussetts. I had to go to Massachussetts and click on Boston there. I was redirected to some small town in europe in linconshire. That's not right! There are other Bostons out there. I never heard of the other boston was deeply offended it didn't direct to Boston in the USA. If there are other bostons then it should go to a disambiguation page! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.126.85.55_4fc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.126.85.55">64.126.85.55</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.126.85.55.html" title="User talk:64.126.85.55">talk</a>) 14:33, 13 December 2006</small></p>
<p>Actually 64.126.85.55, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> redirects to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, which I personally find to be a problem, though I understand there has been previous discussion on the matter and it was presumably decided by some Ameri-centric group that this is the way it should be; why anything with a disambig can't point to the disambig I don't understand. <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a>, when I typed "boston" into Google it came up with <a href="http://www.boston.gov.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">Boston Borough Council - Home</a> at 11th position - hardly 256th, and not bad at all considering the huge number of multi-nationals based in its daughter city. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESMeeds_08ad.html" title="User:SMeeds">SMeeds</a> 12:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm sorry but the city Boston, Massachusetts is far more well known and holds a deeper historical context. It is well known, it is not favoritism towards Americans, it is doing what is proper. Last time I checked, he didn't do this London. The English need to relax and realize that this page should lead to the American city since it is far more well known. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillie_Stark_a71e.html" title="User:Willie Stark">Willie Stark</a> 20:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Size or (relative) importance should not dictate where the redirect goes. In my opinion there is enough debate to justify pointing Boston to this disambiguation page, instead of to the supposed most important place with that name. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenzar_6809.html" title="User:Lenzar">Lenzar</a> 12:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>WP policy is pretty clear. The criterion is not size or importance or age, but what the "well known primary meaning" is, "much more used than any other". I think it's pretty clear that in North America, the primary meaning is Boston, Massachusetts, so I checked some non-US sources. On the BBC site, of the first 10 search results for "Boston", 5 were for Mass., 2 were Boston Castle (in Yorks, not Lincs), and 2 were for Lincs. On The Times' site, 6 were for Mass., 2 were for companies (Boston Beer and Credit Suisse First Boston -- both related to Mass.), and 3 were for Lincs. On [site:au Boston] (.au Australian Web sites), 5 were for Mass., and 5 were for names of entities (Boston Marriage, Boston Globe, Boston Marks Group Ltd., Boston Legal -- three related to Mass.); none had anything to do with Lincs. So I think the evidence is quite clear that *even in the UK* (outside Lincs, presumably), Boston's "primary meaning" is Boston, Massachusetts. I haven't checked other non-UK, non-Commonwealth sources, but I'm quite sure that "Boston" in Moscow or Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo or Cairo also refers to Boston, Mass. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since I started this discussion all that time ago, I feel I ought to come back in and state my view. Since the remarks of <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillie_Stark_a71e.html" title="User:Willie Stark">Willie Stark</a> above, and the fact that someone changed the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> redrect from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Boston (disambiguation)">Boston (disambiguation)</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, I have placed a signpost to this disambiguation page on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. I am now perfectly happy wherever the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> redirect points (within reason). While looking at the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Talk%7EBoston%2C_Massachusetts_f794.html" title="Talk:Boston, Massachusetts">Talk:Boston, Massachusetts</a> page, I was a little concerned that a discussion had been going on there about renaming the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> as "Boston" - concerned because it had not been mentioned here (where there would no doubt be many interested parties). I am pleased nevertheless that the discussion has obviously concluded without concensus. The only matter that remains is that the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> redirect is probably going to continue swinging from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Boston (disambiguation)">Boston (disambiguation)</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> and back again (not that I will do it), but I believe the signpost is appropriate immunisation for me from caring. Although there is obviously some degree of pride involved here, my main motivation is that people are not led to believe that there is only one historically significant place in the world called Boston. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESMeeds_08ad.html" title="User:SMeeds">SMeeds</a> 18:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
