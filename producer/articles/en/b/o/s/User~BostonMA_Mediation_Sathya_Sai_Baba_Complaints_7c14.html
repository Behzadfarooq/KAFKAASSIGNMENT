<p>The lates dispute about the inclusion of the word "boy" that I have with SSS108 cannot, I think, be a case in the mediation because I followed all policies of Wikipedia (i.e. providing verifiable, reputable sources such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">salon.com</a>), but still SSS108 continues to revert my edits. If SSS108 is so unreasonable or ignorant of Wikipedia policies then what is there left to mediate in this case? I have no intention to have the word "boy" removed unless SSS108 or others come with new good reasons. Until now I have not seen any. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:41, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, the Salon.com article was discussed as possibly being an op-ed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#Media_articles_and_op-eds" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#Media_articles_and_op-eds" rel="nofollow">Reference</a> The fact that Michelle Goldberg had private, reciprocated correspondence, with Anti-Sai Activists, in which she expressed a hope of bringing attention to their cause proves it was written with a personal bias. Even Andries said <i>"Read the articles and watch their documentaries and it is clear that Michelle Goldberg of Salon.com, Danish Radio, and Tanya Datta of the BBC are sympathetic to the critics and ex-followers"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#External_links" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#External_links" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Goldberg's private correspondence is published on Andries Anti-Sai Site <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/frameset.html?page=untouchable" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/frameset.html?page=untouchable" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Therefore, the Salon.com article was not neutral and was specifically written with a personal, Anti-Sai point of view being expressed (op-ed).</dd>

<p>BostonMA, I was wondering if you can kindly assess whether or not Andries is willing to complete the mediation process. Andries seems more interested in the Prem Rawat article than participating in this mediation, which he agreed to. In my opinion, Andries is stonewalling the discussion and I was hoping you could create a time-table within which Andries would answer the questions. I think this is only fair. I also noticed that Andries promptly responded to questions about the Salon.com article, which he felt was important, but seems hesitant to answer questions that directly challenge the notability of Premanand. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 02:59, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Andries, it is not clear from your comment whether you are saying that you feel that it is OK to not answer questions promptly if you do not feel they are urgent. Could you clarify whether you are willing to answer questions promptly? One of the reasons why prompt answers are useful is that the other parties and the mediator do not wait unnecessarily for your response. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 12:51, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will answer the questions, but if you have seen our discussions at <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESathya_Sai_Baba_317d.html" title="Talk:Sathya Sai Baba">talk:Sathya Sai Baba</a> and our edits at <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> then I hope that you will agree with me that SSS108 and I continue to have dispute and disagreements, but that they are now to a great extent productive, that is they lead to a better article. In contrast, our previous disputes were to a great extent unproductive: we both repeated our arguments endlessly and both kept reverting the edits of the other. There is much to gain when I and SSS108 now devote our time to improving the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 15:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andries, I recognize that the disputes have become more productive and less repetitive. I also recognize that the SSB article has been improving. Further, I appeciate that you have answered a number of the open questions within the last day. However, I would like to press you for an answer to the particular question of whether or not you feel that you should answer mediation questions promptly, even when you do not believe those questions to be important or urgent. On more than one occassion, you have not responded to issues on the mediation page, or even questions that I put to you directly on talk pages.</dd>

<p>I notice that SSS108 criticizes me for editing Wikipedia without giving a reply to outstanding mediation questions. I have always edited other subjects than Sathya Sai Baba and I will continue to do so. And let us face, the dispute about the Sathya Sai Baba set of articles may be resolved to some extent, but they will never be fully resolved: SSS108 will always want to minimize and discredit criticism and I will always resist that. No mediation is going to change that. I think it is reasonable that BostonMA will after some time stop mediation. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 16:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Andries, it is clear (and fully documented on Wikipedia) that you will <b>always</b> want to minimize and discredit favorable content about SSB and push your POV. The only one who has stonewalled, circumvented and effectively stopped mediation has been <b>you</b>. When something is discussed that is important to your POV, you answer the questions within one day (i.e., Nagel, Goldberg, including/excluding Kasturi, etc.). However, when it comes to other questions that are meant to assess your neutrality and your understanding of NPOV, you delay, give indirect responses, say it is <i>"not urgent"</i>, <i>"not relevant"</i>, etc. You consistently fail to give reasons for your refusal to answer these questions <b>directly</b>. BostonMA asked you specific questions on this page and on your talk page and you <b>ignored</b> his questions. This rightly casts a shadow on your sincerity to participate in mediation. I don't know if BostonMA accepted your answer to his question about promptly answering questions, however, as far as I can see, you did <b>not</b> answer the question. You have <b>not</b> agreed to answer questions promptly. Rather, you create a loophole you can jump through for not answering questions. This is unfair to everyone involved. Apparently the entire mediation process is supposed to revolve around you, your time schedule, your likes and dislikes and your assessments on whether the questions are <i>"urgent"</i>, <i>"relevant"</i> or not. (BostonMA, yes you can move this response if you want.) <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 18:39, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have answered all questions posed by the mediator so it is beyond me why you say that I stopped or circumvented mediation. It is true that I have stated that questions regarding sources that are not used in any of the SSB related articles cannot reasonably be considered urgent and I continue to hold this opinion. And of course, it takes me more time to develop an opinion on subjects and sources that I have not thought about. When I already have an opinion then I am able to reply promptly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:08, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Give all the facts, Andries. You answered the questions after several <b>weeks</b> of delays.
