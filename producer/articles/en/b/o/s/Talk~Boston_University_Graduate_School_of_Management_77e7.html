<p>I am on the road and don't have access to my references to quote chapter and verse, so I am merely stating my understanding here for discussion until I get home next week.</p>
<p>I believe it is simply untrue to claim that the Graduate School of Management was founded in 1925. I don't see how a Graduate School of Management can claim a 1925 founding when all graduate degrees issued by BU until well into the 1950s, (except those in Medicine and a few other specialized areas) were issued by the Graduate School. The Graduate School was a separate department of BU on an equal level with the College of Liberal Arts (CLA, later CAS), the Medical School, and the other schools and colleges of the University - i.e. it was not part of CLA.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/apply/graduate.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bu.edu/apply/graduate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/apply/graduate.html</a> you will see that there is in fact a "Graduate School of Management (GSM)" which is not the same as the "School of Management (SMG)." As a current student in the "GRADUATE School of Management" I can also attest to the fact that the two institutions are indeed separate. If you do not believe this, feel free to contact (GSM's) Graduate Programs Office. If you have no comment on this within the next 24 hours, I will revert to the page before your changes.</p>

<dd>It's been several months now and I (and apparently Pzavon, as well) have stepped away from this debate to allow things to cool for a while. Unfortunately, I still disagree that there is a "Graduate School of Management" at BU, and I believe the facts support this assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please understand, no one is contending that the graduate programs at SMG are not referred to as belonging to the "Graduate School of Management." I myself have heard people refer to it in this way, and in fact many University systems do the same. For example, the Student Link<a href="http://www.bu.edu/studentlink/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bu.edu/studentlink/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, when looking up classes, requires you to select "GSM" to view classes in the SMG graduate program, just as you say. However, if you look, you will also see EOP (English for International Students), OTP (Officer Training Program, ROTC), PDP (Physical Education Classes), among many others. There can be no valid argument that any of these are actually colleges or schools of their own; they appear in the registration system separately as an organizational demarcation (English for International Students) or because there is no other logical place to put them (ROTC).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, to reiterate, no one is contending that the term "Graduate School of Management" is not used or that it does not appear on official documents. However, this usage is merely to distinguish the graduate program from the undergraduate program, and also likely because people think that it adds prestige to have a separate graduate school as opposed to having the undergrad and graduate programs in one school (in my opinion).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, I must once again make my objection known to the "Graduate School of Management" being referred to as a separate school.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I propose the following compromise: The article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_Graduate_School_of_Management_947c.html" title="Boston University Graduate School of Management">Boston University Graduate School of Management</a> be reverted to its status as a redirect to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_School_of_Management_377a.html" title="Boston University School of Management">Boston University School of Management</a>, and a significant mention of the fact that the graduate programs are often referred to as the "Graduate School of Management" be placed in the introductory paragraph of the SMG article.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I find this proposal to be a reasonable one. However, we should be careful to capture the information in the GSM article that is not at present duplicated in the SMG article. <a href="../../../p/z/a/User%7EPzavon_ab25.html" title="User:Pzavon">Pzavon</a> 00:43, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I carried this out, at long last. -<a href="../../../p/j/o/User%7EPjorg_e8e3.html" title="User:Pjorg">Pjorg</a> 23:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
