<p>Some of the bosses listed as "famous" don't seem to be that well known. These are The Crystal Whale (The New Zealand Story), Doppelganger (R-Type), LeChuck (The Secret of Monkey Island), The 'Mothership' (Gradius), and The Swordmaster (The Secret of Monkey Island). I could be wrong, but their validity should be checked. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a></p>

<dd>'Famous' is of course completely subjective; some of those bosses I've never heard of, but that's because I don't play certain types of games. However:</dd>

<dd>

<dd>Doppelganger is certainly famous - it's the most well-known <i>R-Type</i> boss and the only one with a name. Also, it makes a cameo appearance in a sequel.</dd>

<dd>The Crystal Whale might perhaps not be too well-known, but I put it in because it's quite unique - firstly for being a crystal whale, and secondly for the fact that it can only be killed after it eats you.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps using the word "famous" is asking for trouble, but it might not be all that subjective. Famous, the way I see it, ought to mean a name a decently large portion of gamers in general would recognize. This obviously includes Bowser Koopa, but probably not the Crystal Whale. One possibility if people want to include every boss they can think of is to create a list of video game bosses and there list all bosses that have or may be considered worthy of having a Wikipedia article, keeping only a few of the most important ones here. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> 22:10, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I don't have a lot of info to offer up, I'd love to see some history on the development of the "boss." Boss characters were an integral part of the shift from retro games to modern level and story based games. Obviously, Bowser came fairly early in the concept--but Bowser was almost the same every time. Yet, between the time of SMBI and SMBII (american), mini-bosses came into their own and bosses started having character. I would guess that the original MegaMan was also very influential in creating bosses with character and theme, especially in relating that to the level in which they were found. The Legend of Zelda also must have been influential; to the best of my recollection it introduced boss "recycling" where an earlier boss became a mini-boss in later levels. Both Zelda and MegaMan had boss "weak points" or vulnerabilities. Hmmm, actually, reviewing the timelines, MegaMan looks like it came out in 87, and so benefited from the earlier development. Also, Kung-Fu came out in 1984 and had distinct boss characters with unique attacks/strategies. Compare Kung-Fu with other early titles like Ice Climber, Excite Bike, Dunk Hunt, Elevator Action, etc, and I see a distinction. Commando was a very early game too, in 1986, but I don't remember what kinds of bosses (if any) it had. So all in all, I'd love to see a treatise on the development of the boss character from say 1983 to 1988. Seems like it went from being a non-existant technique to being established and ubiquitous in that time frame. Any thoughts?</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'd say you like Nintendo too much.&#160;;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a good idea, now I think about it. I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I am quite heavily biased toward <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrolling_shooter.html" title="Scrolling shooter">scrolling shooters</a>, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, you've that Mario game thingy, and <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Gradius.html" title="Gradius">Gradius</a></i>, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> you've got <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius_%28game%29.html" title="Darius (game)">Darius</a></i>, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And then it really gets going. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, I can name <i><a href="../../../r/-/t/R-Type_ec2e.html" title="R-Type">R-Type</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raiden_%28game%29.html" title="Raiden (game)">Raiden</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Islands_bafb.html" title="Rainbow Islands">Rainbow Islands</a></i> as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles&#160;;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from <i><a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorf.html" title="Gorf">Gorf</a></i>, an arcade game released in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, in the prime of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Invaders_f242.html" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a> Era. <i>Gorf</i> was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept <i>of</i> a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpottedowl_2cc8.html" title="User:Spottedowl">Spottedowl</a> 12:56, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not that I like Nintendo so much, it's just that's what I had and therefore remember&#160;;) Problem is, it's difficult to pin down dates on these games. Wikipedia has a really nice list of NES games, and the first hundred or so all have the release dates specified. But I haven't looked at other consoles or arcade games etc. Getting all of that data fleshed out seems like a great task for WikiPedia. Anyway, I played all of my side scrolling shooters on my TurboGrafx and Duo, so I tend to think of them as having been later. But you're right, the arcade originals came a good bit earlier. You're right that everything was well established by 87; I suggested examining 83-88 for a nice 5 year window, but 84-87 might cover all of the advances.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not familiar with Gorf or the D&amp;D example the article mentions. I'm trying to remember arcade games from before I got my NES, but I can only remember PacMan, Asteroids, Space Invaders, Defender, Donkey Kong, Qbert (I think this was before my NES), Elevator Action, and Kung-Fu. Kung-Fu clearly had well-formed bosses--even more so than Bowser. They had life meters (where "normal" enemies didn't), unique appearences, unique attack patterns, did extra damage, and came at the end of the level. I suppose an extensive review of ATARI 2600 games would be in order. I'm willing to ignore the other early consoles for the moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, what about computer games, though? Did early text adventures ever have bosses? I never really played Zork or Adventure or anything. However, King's Quest first came out in 1983, although I don't know if you'd consider KQ to have bosses or levels--it had sections I guess. Rogue was out in like 81 or something, but I've only played Nethack (Hack came out around 85, Nethack shortly thereafter?). Nethack has bosses of sorts, but I just don't know about Rogue. <a href="http://digital-eel.com/hcg/index1.htm" class="external text" title="http://digital-eel.com/hcg/index1.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> might refresh your memories about early PC games. All in all, I get the feeling that bosses are pretty much a console phenomenon.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I don't make a distinction between computer games, console games, video games and arcade games. They're all the same thing to me. This argument has been had several times on Wikipedia already, and I don't think it's going to be settled any time soon.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But in any case, bosses are certainly not a console phenomenon, any more than, say, parallax scrolling is. Bosses are a fundamental gameplay concept. In fact, I've heard a complaint made before that bosses in arcade games are just a sneaky way of killing off the player to make him put more money into the machine. (Although I don't agree with this.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not terribly familiar with early text adventures, but I doubt they have things that we would call bosses. Text adventures are more about adventure than fighting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another thought has occurred to me: how old is the walk-along-and-hit-people genre? (The only game I can think of as an example is <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Axe_7fd0.html" title="Golden Axe">Golden Axe</a></i>, but I know there are loads more.) I'm pretty sure that kind of game naturally lent itself to having bosses. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpottedowl_2cc8.html" title="User:Spottedowl">Spottedowl</a> 01:31, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That'd be the side-crolling <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_%27em_up.html" title="Beat 'em up">beat 'em up</a> genre; Kung Fu has already been cited there. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 02:29, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ok, I found a great site to research this a little: <a href="http://www.arcade-history.com" class="external text" title="http://www.arcade-history.com" rel="nofollow">Arcade History</a>. Looking through some entries, it seems as though 1982 was a real banner year at the arcade: Dig-Dug, Q-Bert, Pole Position, Moon Patrol, Joust, and Burger Time are all famous. Significantly, Xevious was also released in 82, and it definitely had an episodic level structure, although I don't remember whether it has bosses. Also, sounds like it was already innovating:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Xevious was among the first games to use pre-rendered graphics and was the first vertically scrolling shooter to allow you to target both land-based and airborne enemies."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1983 saw Dragon's Lair come out--did it have bosses? It was obviously revolutionary in other ways. For point of reference, 1983 also saw the original Mario Bros, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, and Star Wars.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1984 looks like things might be coming together. 1942 came out, and I'm almost positive it had bosses. Kung-Fu comes out, pretty much inventing the beat-em-up genre. Interesting side note I never knew: apparently it's based on a Jackie Chan movie, "Wheels on Meals"! Legend of Kage is also 1984 (wow, I thought it must have been later since it had much nicer graphics). Punch Out!!! had bosses, of sorts, at least in the NES Mike Tyson version where Mike himself was a "boss." The arcade version was 1984.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By 1985 the idea is used several places: Gradius, Gun Smoke, Ghosts'n'Goblins, Space Harrier and surely others in the arcades (did Rush'n'Attack have bosses?), and Super Mario Bros on the NES.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a note on the beat-em-up genre, Double Dragon in 1987 extended the ideas from Kung-Fu substantially and established the genre as we still know it today. Bad Dudes came out in 88 (man, the NES version ruined that game! but the arcade was great&#160;:), Golden Axe didn't come along unil 89, and I think Final Fight in 90.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So overall, if somebody can confirm or deny that the arcade version of Xevious had bosses, that would give us a good start. To be really academic about it, somebody should still check through all those less popular games that none of us remember. Thanks for the input everybody-</dd>

<dd>Wow, I never even knew what <i>Xevious</i> was before. That throws my entire 'history of the scrolling shooter' out of whack.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Xevious</i> apparently did have bosses. I'm not sure if it had different bosses or whether the same one kept recurring, as in <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Gradius.html" title="Gradius">Gradius</a></i>. The boss I've seen is a large, disc-shaped mothership. Nonetheless, the boss concept is definitely there. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpottedowl_2cc8.html" title="User:Spottedowl">Spottedowl</a> 18:20, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, Xevious is pretty cool, and I had no idea it came out so early, cause the console ports came out much later (and it was sufficiently ahead of it's time that it didn't look old 3 years later!). <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/" class="external text" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a great place to find out more information about NES games. Checking there, I found that 1942 did have bosses (I trust porting to the NES didn't change this aspect), although I think they're all the same, and they're not every level.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess my next question is: Have there been any significant innovations in bosses since 1988? Or has the boss formula been set in stone for <i>15 years</i>?! I guess street fighter type fighting games changed it a little: bosses come only at the end of the game, since there are no "levels" exactly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I'm not sure I'm confident enough yet to update the article, but I'm seeing the basic timeline as follows:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1982: Xevious ==&gt; 1984: 1942, Kung-Fu ==&gt; 1985: Gradius, Gun Smoke, SMB, and others ==&gt; 1986: bosses everywhere ==&gt; 1987: Double Dragon, MegaMan, Legend of Zelda demonstrate mini-bosses, bosses with specific weaknesses/vulnerabilities. Note, too, that I'm referring to arcade version dates where applicable (as most of these were ported to NES and other consoles).</dd>

<dd>I've heard of a boss in a <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_b93e.html" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a> game that you are not supposed to be able to beat. You are required to fail to make the game continue and the story unfold. If you beat him (which I've heard is posible, thogh very hard) the game bugs out completely. Sounds quite innovative. Can anyone confirm this?</dd>

<p><br />
If anyone is interested, here is how the Boss was created.</p>
<p>There were other Dungeons and Dragons type games on Plato. A player started on the outside of the dungeon and went in was attacked by monsters. If you got out of the dungeon, you kept the gold you had accumulated. Your player was saved from one day to the next, from one week to the next. If you died, then you lost everything. The dungeons had a finite size, and people would play the game for hours (which suprised us) and sooner or later would go into every corner of the dungeon. The character got stronger by gathering magic swords, etc. At some point, the character would be so strong that he could kill everything, at which point the player would lose interest in the game and quit.</p>
<p>We noticed that people created characters and spent time naming them and getting "attached" to them, and kind of treated them like a person. So, we asked something like, "Suppose that the character is real. Why would a real person keep going into the same dungeon over and over again?" And, then the answer was simple: To bring out something really spectacular.</p>
<p>So, then we said, "Hey, what if the player had to 'bring out an orb'?" And then we said, "Yeah, but if the orb is worth anything, then something really neat has to defend it." So, we put the orb into a "treasure room" and decided to stack a bunch of smaller monsters on top of a really big monster in the treasure room directly in front of "the orb". The character had to defeat 30 smaller monsters before confronting the "Golden Dragon"--a monster with probably 1,000,000 hit points. If he defeated the Golden Dragon, then he got the orb. He would then have to fight his way out of the dungeon.</p>
<p>In retrospect, what we did was create a video game that was a story. It had a beginning (the character initially enters the dungeon and builds up strenght), a middle (the character explores the dungeon), a climax (he finds the orb and battles the monsters, before confronting the Golden Dragon), a denoument (the character, weakened by the battle, staggers back through the dungeon, avoiding monsters and finally to safety), and an end (the charcter after leaving the dungeon with the orb is enshrined in a hall of fame). We did this in 1974-1975.</p>
<p>Plato was way ahead of its time. The first video games (consoles or arcade) in the late 1970s did not have a boss. To challenge the player, the game simply did either "more" (put more of the same enemy on the screen) or made the enemy move "faster". The first boss in a console/arcade game was either in Battlezone! (a 'supertank') or Tempest.</p>
<p>Text games (Zork, Collosal Cave) did not have a boss. They were simply a collection of word games.</p>

<p>What does the "versus" in this line mean?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In versus fighting games such as Street Fighter II ...
<dl>

<p>Also, this image caption says "flashing in red" but I don't see any red in the picture. Should this be "magenta"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Baxter Stockman, the boss of the first level of Turtles in Time. Note that he is flashing red, indicating that he is close to defeat.
<dl>
<dd>He is indeed flashing red - it's just a little bit difficult to see because (a) it is not actually flashing in the picture and (b) Baxter's non-flashing color mixed with the red (as the "flashing" works in most games) makes it seem a little more magenta-like. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pugh_fec7.html" title="User:Ian Pugh">Ian Pugh</a> 03:53, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dnd was written in 1975. It had a boss. Nintendo's first video game was not released until 1977. The Atari 2600 was not released until 1977. Thus, dnd predates Nintendo and Atari by two years.

<p>I think we should take the lists of "noteworthy" bosses and superbosses and put them in a seperate article, then have no more than 5 examples of each in this article.

<p>As far as I know, the first game to explicitly list an end-level, stronger opponent as "Boss" is the arcade game "Renegade" (which was ported to several other platforms) in 1985. In Japan, the gangs depicted in the game were called "Bousouzoku". So, a bit of japgrish translation did the magic. -- Tincho</p>
<p>I have a related question that isn't addressed in the History. Where did the title "Boss" come from (as applied to video games)? How did video game Bosses come to be called "Bosses"? I can only guess that there may have been some popular video game in which the end boss was explicitly identified as being the "Boss" of the henchman. An alternative theory I've heard is that "Boss" was somehow imported from Kung Fu movies tradition-- the lyrics to the 1974 song "Kung Fu Fighting" contains a reference to fighting a Boss:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There was funky Billie Jim and little Sammy Chong</i></dd>
<dd><i>He said,"Here comes the big boss, let's get it on!"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>A related question is, when did the video game term "Boss" enter common usage? I seem to remember using it aroud '85 or so, but that could be false memory. -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 10:34, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I always thought "BOSS" had its roots in Kung fu movie genre, but I never could find anything to substantiate it. Infact I would even go as far as to say that the word "Boss" in videogames is directly related to a Bruce Lee movie, The Big Boss (1971). It was the actors 1st major film and led to him becoming an international star.

I would like to add to the part of the article discussing "Unbeatable" bosses. You list Yggdrasil from Tales of Symphonia as a truly unbeatable boss.

<dd>Oh, I don't doubt it, but the thing needs to be totally re-written because it represents an amazingly large page section on just one thing. Personally, I'd point to the classic Trick Boss [the mirror image in Prince of Persia, which the player couldn't defeat in combat because it would mirror any hits to itself against the player; you could only beat it by sheathing your sword and walking into it, whereupon it vanished] and point to something like Nemesis or the Shagohod on the runway as an unbeatable boss, though I <i>know</i> there's a better example than those in there. I'd say a maximum of three bosses of any particular type, with each one significantly different in some way [ie, the Mirror Image, Psycho Mantis and one of the various 'heal the boss to death' encounters from the <i>Final Fantasy</i> games as trick bosses, since they use substantially different tricks and are from three genres].

<dd>This entire article takes up way too much space. I find it fascinating that the authors of the WWII article managed to clock in at under half the length of this monstrosity. Specifically, too much time is spent speculating about the "types" of bosses, which neither make any objective case nor cite any references. The fact that the authors of this section choose to reference only recent console games belies the current article's amatuerish nature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides being shoddily written, the section is loaded with too many abstract concepts and not enough raw meat. As a programmer, I'd think the most objective way to typify video game "bosses" would be by the various automata that make up their behaviors. In that sense, there are really only three kinds of "boss" behavior: Pattern, Hunt/Flee, and Random, with various mixtures thereof. Three strong, <b>brief</b> examples might suffice, but only as an examination of these base automata.</dd>

<p>Examples for each section should be kept to 3 at best, up to 5 if absolutely necessary. Each example should also state (briefly!) WHY that particular boss is an exemplary specimen of that particular boss type. (Bowser, for example, is one of, if not THE most famous final boss in the video game world. The necessity of including Bowser is obvious. On the other hand, can your average gamer tell you who Sardius, of Super Ghosts n' Ghouls is? No. His inclusion is pointless.) Anything (be it the boss or worse, the game iself) with a redlink should be removed without mercy. Concerning the many supposed boss types: we need to trim those down, badly. SEVENTEEN boss types is a little excessive. Let's aim for fifteen. Even ten.</p>
<p>My suggestions for trimming the categories are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grunt Bosses can be briefly mentioned under Mini-Bosses.</li>
<li>Non-Antagonist Boss isn't even really a boss, take it out.</li>
<li>Rename Stylish Boss "Quick Boss" and put an example of a boss that players have to race. (After all, just because you're quick doesn't make you stylish; and who defines stylish anyway? Quick is less subjective.)</li>
<li>Combine Trick Boss and Puzzle Boss, call it...oh, I don't know. Keep the name Trick Boss. Most Puzzle Bosses involve some kind of trick anyway, as opposed to a serious puzzle. (For example, the bosses in Ocarina of Time. One has to utilize some kind of trick [like an item found earlier in the dungeon] to defeat them. That's not a puzzle, you just have to know the trick to defeat them.)</li>
<li>Combo Boss...I'm not sure. I think it could be merged out somewhere, or even deleted outright. It's not THAT notable.</li>
<li>Multi-Stage Boss? Merge to Final Boss. Multi-stagers are almost exclusively final bosses.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Go for it. This article is a nightmare. I suggest booting 'strong' and 'stylish' bosses as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Look at the sentence for the 'strong boss': "This boss is difficult to defeat because it has a lot of energy and/or deals a large amount of damage." Sounds like a typical boss to me. The 'stylish boss' has very weak examples. I would also get rid of the 'trick boss', and instead discuss the idea of 'boss vulnerability' in a seperate section, noting that some bosses may have quirky weaknesses which go beyond what is normal, and sometimes this may be the only way to beat them.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 19:44, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Agreed, Strong Boss ought to go, as bosses that are not "strong" that way are an anomaly, not the other way around. Another thought - what do you think of using <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFaqs_e7e9.html" title="GameFaqs">GameFaqs</a>' yearly Chracter Battles to determine notability of boss characters? Since the contests are pretty much based on popularity, non-notable bosses end up at the bottom, while notable ones end up on top. Could we possibly make appearance on that list a criteria for inclusion as an example boss? (And if not, we should try to draw from those bosses who appear in the Battles where we can.) After all, the community determines notability, and GameFaqs represents a huge subset of the gamer population.

<dd>It's a reasonable idea, although I can see a couple of problems. The first is that a boss's popularity may be based on their characteristics as a fictional <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antagonist.html" title="Antagonist">antagonist</a>, rather than on their... erm... 'bossness'. The second is that going simply on popularity may skew the examples away from certain genres, for example scrolling shoot 'em ups.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 12:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>True. Still, I think it could be a reasonable starting place, as long as we don't draw every example from it.

<li>The <i>Strong Boss</i> section needs to exist, as it describes bosses that are invulverable for a duration with brief moments of vulnerability (during which their appearance usually physically changes). Perhaps it should be renamed, or merged with "Trick Boss"?</li>
<li><i>Stylish Boss</i> is also something with important fragments. Maybe a word would be "Quick Boss", or even "Peer Boss"? A boss who has similarities to the character, sometimes even using the same attacks and defenses. For instance, the Sonic the Hedgehog game series has no Stylish/Quick/Peer boss until you fight Knuckles in <i>Sonic and Knuckles</i>.</li>
<li>What's wrong with <i>Non-antagonist Boss</i>? It is indeed a boss, as you can lose the game by losing the friendly competition.</li>
<li>"Optional Boss" or "Hidden Boss" is a better name than <i>Super Boss</i>, as not all optionals are super-powered.</li>
<li><i>Final Boss</i>, <i>Mini-Boss</i>, <i>Non-antagonist Boss</i>, <i>Super Boss</i>, and <i>Stalker Boss</i> all have to do with the significance or characterization of bosses. The other categories ("Team Boss", "Trick Boss", etc.) have to do with the actual boss battle, the boss's strengths, and how it must be defeated. These should probably be two different sets of categories.</li>
<li>The article currently has *way* too many examples from the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games.&#160;:-) -BaronGrackle (69.151.177.115 01:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC))</li>

<dd>Bosses whose vulnerability changes with time could be discussed in a single sentence. Same with peer bosses. 'Peer boss' is quite a good name... but we can't promote original terms on Wikipedia. I still think it's better to have a section on <b>boss vulnerability</b> rather than lots of vague, overlapping categories. They just attract mountains of 'examples'. Now we have 'Odd couple bosses' - presumably we could have 'Immobile bosses', 'Flying bosses', 'Background bosses', 'Segmented bosses', 'Screen-filling bosses' etc. It's endless.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 19:14, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know, that's the problem with categories. There's always the potential to get more detailed, and then they start getting stupidly specific and terribly overlapping. We should determine a certain number of broad categories, and stick with them. "Minor categories" (like "Odd Couple Boss") should be reduced to a sentence-long mention in their parent category. (For example, "Certain team bosses are composed of two dissimilar characters, often complementing one another's weaknesses, instead of the standard identical team.") I also agree with BaronGrackle that we should separate the categories into "significance or characterization" of boss, versus "actual boss battle." <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 22:27, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You guys had let someone write in this article that American Dungeons and Dragons game designers had invented bosses. I read all this article and you know a lot about bosses. Why would you let such BS be in your article? They look like they go all over wikipedia saying they invented bosses and if someone says it's not true they just erase it again.

<p>I've culled these two boss types from the article. The terms 'strong boss' and 'stylish boss' are not commonly used gaming terms, with these specific meanings. "This boss is difficult to defeat because it has a lot of energy and/or deals a large amount of damage" simply applies to almost any sort of boss.

<p>I've just deleted huge tracts of what are obviously neologisms and original research. Harsh, I know, but I don't think we were ever going to find references for this terminology. I believe the way forward is for us to reference-up the history and common critical responses (positive and negative) to the presence of bosses in games, and then ensure anything else added is referenced and <i>absolutely not original research</i>. The article currently has multiple spoilers for multiple different games. I'd like to find an alternative to that if possible. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 18:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a> does seem to be a large problem in this article. I made a small edit to improve some prose earlier, but a closer look at the whole article indicates that nothing in the article is properly sourced. Given how far the video game industry has come, it's possible that <i>someone</i> reputable has written a professional article or discussion of the history of bosses. Finding something like this should be the first priority before any other changes are made, and then the article would have to be re-written to focus on the sources found.

<dd>Ideally, I wouldn't want to think that any editor has any more 'pull' than anyone else. Regarding the article, the main problem is that most articles about bosses aren't written in a way which can be easily adapted into a complete encyclopedic article. Usually they're in the style of 'the top 20 most kickass bosses ever' and suchlike. Nothing comprehensible to non-gamers is likely to come from such sources. What would be good are discussions of bosses from game design textbooks.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 19:00, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Most games with bosses often have one as the last obstacle in the way of victory. This "final" or "last" boss is often the most difficult enemy in the game. A notable exception is the Gradius and Grandia series, where the last bosses don't defend themselves and are defeated quite effortlessly."</p>
<p>Haven't played those games. Is this true, or just someone complaining about how easy certain bosses are? I mean, <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X-2_a57c.html" title="Final Fantasy X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>'s</i> last boss was a joke, but I don't think they made him weak <b>on purpose</b>.
