eleventh edition (year: 1910 (!)), Volume IV, page 281, 
</pre>
<p>entry "Bosnia and Herzegovina", subentry (#10) Population and National Characteristics (quote:)</p>
<p>In 1895 the population, which tends to increase slowly... numbered 1,568,092. The alien element is small, consisting chiefly of Austro-Hungarians, gipsies, Italians and Jews. Spanish is a common language of the Jews, whose ancestors fled hither, during the 16th century, to escape the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The natives are officialy described as Bosniaks, but classify themselves according to religion. Thus the Roman Catholics PREFER the name of CROATS, Hrvats or Latins; the Orthodox, of SERBS; THE MOSLEMS, OF TURKS.</p>
<p>All alike belong to the Serbo-Croatian branch of the Slavonic race; and all speak a language almost identical to Serbian, though written by the Roman Catholics in Latin instead of Cyrillic letters.</p>
<p>TO AVOID OFFENDING EITHER "SERBS" OR "CROATS," IT IS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED "BOSNITCH." ... The Bosnians or Bosniaks resemble their Serbian kindfolk in both appearance and character. They have the same love for poetry, music and romance; the same *intense* pride in their race and history; many of the same superstitions and customs. The Christians retain the Serbian costume, modified in detail, as the occasional use of the turban or fez. The "Turkish" women have in some districts abandoned the veil; but in others they even cover the eyes when they leave home. (end quote)</p>
<hr />
<p>Who wrote this Serbian propaganda?????????????????????????????????</p>
<p>I have nothing against the people of Serbia even if they did lots of bad to us. Iam Bosnian 1st My ancestors were Croat YES as most of my counrtymen will agree with that. Those who dont have no idea and have been barinwashed by politics. Pointless to say that the things we Bosnians have in common with Serbs is Turkish things not Serbian. All the costumes, food, music are Turkish origin etc....</p>

<p>Bosnian ban (viceroy) Stefan Kotromanic (1322-1353) declares in 1333. a letter to Dubrovnik in which he states: "Thus I the noble ban Stefan impress my golden seal, so that all may know and see the truth. This is why the seals are equal, two in Latin and two in Serbian and all are sealed in gold.". "</p>
<p>hahhaha maybe serbo-croatian to be correct</p>
<p><a name=".22The_letter_to_Dubrovnik"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">"The letter to Dubrovnik</span></h2>
<p>The Pope sent in 1188 to the bishop of Dubrovnik a letter and in it he acknowledges all the old rights of the Dubrovnik church. In the letter, he mentions Serbian Bosnia: "regnum Servilie, quod est Bosna" (Serbian kingdom of Bosnia). That was in the time of Ban Kulin.</p>
<p>("regnum" must have loosely meant kingdom in that time for, Bosnia was then a "banovina")</p>
<p><br />
"From: I. Kukuljevic, Codex diplom, II, 148, p. 21.) " "In Perugia, February 24th., 1252 In his letter, Johannes, the archbishop of Dubrovnik (archiepiscopus Ragusinus), mentions Serbian Bosnia: "regnum Seruilie, quod est Bosgna" i.e. "Serbian kingdom of Bosnia". ("Regnum" must have loosely meant kingdom in that time for, Bosnia was then a "banovina".) "...tria regna, videlicet regnum Zachlomie, regnum Seruilie, quod est Bosgna et regnum Tribunie. Et regnum Zachulmie extenditur vsque ad prouinciam Spalatensem, regnum Seruilie extenditur vsque ad prouinciam Collocensem, regnum Tribunie extenditur vsque ad prouinciam Dirachinam." From: "Bullarium Ragusium", 401-402"</p>

<p>1. The first recorded mention of Bosnia was written during this period by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, who described "Bosona" as a district in "baptized Serbia."</p>
<p>2. TVRTKO KOTROMANIC (b. c. 1338--d. 1391), probably the greatest ruler of Bosnia, ruling as Bosnian ban (provincial lord, subservient to the king of Hungary) from 1353 and king of the Serbs and Bosnia from 1377.</p>
<p>3. The Ottoman Turks invaded Bosnia in 1386, and after many battles it became a Turkish province in 1463. Hum held out longer under rulers who styled themselves herceg ("duke") of St. Sava--a name recalled today in Herzegovina.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1917</span></h2>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina Population "Excluding some 30,000 Albanians living in the south-east, the Jews who emigrated in earlier times from Spain, a few Osmanli Turks, the merchants, officials. and Austrian troops, the rest of the population (about 98 per cent) belong to the southern Slavonic people, the Serbs. Although one in race, the people form in religious beliefs three sharply separated divisions: the Mohammedans, about 550,000 persons (35 per cent), Greek Schismatics, about 674,000 persons (43 per cent), and Catholics, about 334,000 persons (21.3 per cent). The last mentioned are chiefly peasants."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">De Originibus Slavicis, 1745, Joan Christofori de Jordan</span></h2>
<p>In his study of the Slavs (De Originibus Slavicis, 1745), Joan Christofori de Jordan, one of the founders of Slavistics in Germania, believes that early German sources, namely Einhard (e.g. Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur), offer important information as to Serbia-Bosnia's western borders. According to Christofori, all the historical evidence strongly suggests that Serbi-Bosnia's western border ran along the Una and Sava rivers, centered at Srb, an ancient stronghold on the Una River.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Illyria Sacrum, Daniele Farlati</span></h2>
<p>Illyria Sacrum is a massive eight-volume history of the Church in Illyria prepared in the 18th and 19th centuries by three Italian Jesuits, Filipo Riceputi, Daniele Farlati and Jacobo Coleti. Illyria Sacrum is based on some 300 volumes of raw source materials collected over a twenty-year period. The first volume was published in 1751 and the eighth in 1819.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Farlati writes, there are two Serbias. One Serbia is Primorje or Maritime Serbia. The other Serbia is Zagorje or Interior Serbia. Zagorje is made up of two parts, Bosnia and Rascia/Raska (partes Serbliae). Bosnia (pars Serbliae), Farlati writes, like Raska, is a Serb land, an original and integral part of Zagorja or Interior Serbia.</p>
<p><br />
As we see above there are only serbs and croats in Bosnia al other thing is propaganda. My own Surname is BOSNJAK and that is a common Serbian AND croatian Surname. My surname coms from he village Bosnia wich is in near KAKANJ in bosnia. We have one church and a lot of houses there it is on a mountain and the village is around 900 years old probobly more but on the cementry you can se alla serbs in my family who was living there in the past. and it is a Serbian village and Bosnjak is just a surename not a peoples kind that people think it is today. Bosnjaks re Serbs and Croats. There are also a lot of villages in Croatia where people is named by their village Bosnjak beacuse their villages name is Bosnia.</p>
<p>I ask you people on this page to add that Bosnjak also is a Serbian and Croatian Surname that has been used much longer that the new people group of "Bosnjak" wich is translated in english Bosniak and Bosnjak in Serbian/Croatian. I do not want to change much on this page beacuse i think you would think ive done wrong but you see there are a lot of Bosnjaks that are serbs or croats</p>

As we all can see the most of people that has the surname Bosnjak is serbian and Croatian! i want this to be public and not people lying because I am a serb and Croat with that surname and i won give to anyone to push dpwn my surname and call it something else that it isnt!! Im right now writing a book in serbian that is about this very common serbian croatian surname and that show that there is no people who are bosnjak that that is just a surname and it will be in English later and then i will make it public and show everyone about the lies that are wrote here and everywhere else. I just dont know if you have a strong Bosnian MUSLIM lobby here but i just want to make a point and that is that BOSNJAK is a surname more then a nation because the bosnjak surname is older than the nation which is counted to be around 10 years old.</p>

<p>I know this topic is probably difficult but I would find it useful to have a note describing what Bosniaks look like. I am a lawyer working for a Bosniak client of Turkish national origins who claims to have been treated in a racist manner. Whether a person is of a different appearence is of importance as to the likelihood of them being treated in a racist manner or being persecuted. Such differences, if there are any, between Bosniaks and e.g. ethnic Serbs or Turks, would not be as readily apparent to an un-travelled Westerner such as myself. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucifer%28sc%29_15f0.html" title="User:Lucifer(sc)">Lucifer(sc)</a> 18:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to be able to help but I'm not sure what to say. People tell each other apart based on speech, dialect, and name rather than physical differences. There isn't really any typical Bosniak face or figure and you'd be hard pressed to find any major differences between Bosniaks and Serbs (or Croats for that matter). Regarding Turks, there there's a more pronounced difference. Bosniaks are generally of a lighter skin tone and brown and blonde hair seem to be more common, whereas most Turks look more like a mediterranean people (slightly darker skin tone, black hair is common). In my experiences Bosniaks are on average a little taller than Turks. There are, however, many Bosniaks that do look very mediterranean, and could probably be mistaken for Turks (perhaps your client is one of them?). <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 19:33, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bosnian Muslims or Bosniaks?</span></h2>
<p><i>Summary</i></p>
<p>This thread discusses whether all the articles that mention Bosnian Muslims should be edited to point to Bosniaks instead. The nation previously known as Bosnian Muslims unanimously decided to change the name to Bosniaks as to avoid ambiguity - there are Bosniaks of other religions, and there are Muslims of other nations. Many disputed this change.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> (and others) are <b>for the edit</b>. Their arguments include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new name, Bosniaks, is a part of the Dayton Peace Accord signed by all warring parties in 1995. One could argue that if Serbs haven't accepted this name the peace wouldn't have been reached. Consequentially, it's a part of all the Bosnian constitutions. Thus, refusing to accept this name is not only childish and immature but also unconstitutional.</li>
<li>Any nation has the right to change its name if it finds the old name inappropriate for any reason. The most recent examples of this include: <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_02d7.html" title="Native Americans">Native Americans</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarusians</a>.</li>
<li>Bosniaks indeed once called themselves Muslims. But requiring that in historical texts a contemporary name should always be used is ludicrous. Accepting consistently such a policy would require thousands of complicated edits throughout Wikipedia including all the articles that mention: the above nations; all married females; all actors and musicians with "artistic" names; countries that changed their names such as <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> (ex Burma) and <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> (ex Ceylon). It's just not a common practice on Wikipedia. Furthermore, if the old name has an ambiguous, incorrect or derisive meaning (such as the case with Bosnian Muslims), bearers of that name would oppose using the old name even in historical context.</li>
<li>The word <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> has a specific ritual meaning. A person who calles themself Muslim assumes certain obligations. Certainly it's an oxymoron to have a note saying "Bosnian Muslim" beside the name of a Communist leader.</li>
<li>"Bosniak" is not the same thing as "Bosnian". "Bosniak" is an archaic form of "Bosnian", but it wasn't used for ages and not outside of Bosnia and Turkey, so there's no harm in it changing its meaning today. If Muslim the nation can be different from Muslim the religion, then Bosniak the nation can be different from Bosnian the citizen of Bosnia.</li>
<li>And what about Bosniaks in Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia? They can't be called "Bosnian Muslims", can they?</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is about facts, it should aim to provide solid facts and not opinions. The Bosniak name is a fact today, accepted by everyone except a few persons.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgor_b7e8.html" title="User:Igor">Igor</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> (and others) are <b>against the change</b>. Their counter-arguments include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DPA is not a retroactive agreement on history. It doesn't change the fact that Bosnian Muslims called themselves that until 1990ies (see argument #3).</li>
<li>These examples do not apply to Bosniaks. Namely, there are two differences compared to Inuit: a) Inuit never called themselves Eskimo (see argument #3) and b) there is no other nation called Inuit - or the word Inuit has no other meaning that would make it ambiguous (see argument #5).</li>
<li>In such cases, for persons their "most well known name" should be used. Whether Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak is more well known is open for discussion. Some consider the name Bosniak to be the one that is ambiguous, incorrect and derisive (see argument #5).</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Croatian_language_560d.html" title="Serbo-Croatian language">BCHS</a> the word Muslim means a nation when written with capital M, and religion when written with lower-case m. It can even be pronounced differently if necessary. In English, the phrase "Bosnian Muslims" can be used to avoid ambiguity (see argument #6).</li>
<li>Bosniak means the same thing as Bosnian, which makes Bosnian Serbs and Croats lesser Bosnians than Muslims.</li>
<li>They are not the same nation as Bosniaks / Bosnian Muslims (not discussed).</li>
<li>Wikipedia is about discussion and everything is open for debate.</li>

<dd>Regarding the third (pro-)point raised above: it's not actually useful or possible to try to deter people from making whatever amount of edits to change these references. Especially given the exactness of the term "Muslims by nationality" compared to "Bosnian Muslims" (now that the former page exists). Unless we actually have a real vote on the issue, such definite statements cannot be made. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 23:17, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With reference to the fifth counter-point raised above, I'll note that the term Bošnjak, is used by a last name among the Croats, though with a different accentuation. Nevertheless, it seems fairly accurate to declare this original term archaic (the modern, used term is "Bosanac/Bosanci" which is noticably different) so that this point isn't particularly important. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 23:17, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, regardless of what <b>you</b> think, Igor, Bosniaks themselves have made up their mind. In 1993, Congress of Bosnian Muslim Intellectuals declared that Bosniak was a more appropriate name then Muslim. The name was a part of Dayton Peace Agreement, and thus, the name Bosniaks was mentioned in Constitutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. Therefore, your stubborn denial of that name is not only childish and immature, but also unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The issue IMO is the same as calling Inuit "Eskimo" or calling Native Americans "Indians". A name given to a nation by others is not necessarily the name they would prefer to be called. A person that respects neutrality should use latter. --<a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 13:21, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term Indians was given to the Native Americans by Indo-Europeans, actually by those thinking they had reached India. The Native Americans never referred to themselves as Indians. The Inuit call themselves the Inu, "the people". The Bosnian Muslims referred to themselves as such prior to 1993 before adopting the term Bosniak (Bošnjaci) all of a sudden so I don't really see the parallel. Isn't it an anachronism to use the term prior to 1993 to describe simply the Muslims? It denoted Bosnians of all faiths prior to 1993. --<a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgor_b7e8.html" title="User:Igor">Igor</a> 5:35, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Depends, true biographers refere to Cassius Clay in the Early days but correct me if I am wrong, when a person changes their name, it means that the decision can be applied retroactively i.e. all former references to the old name can be replaced with the new. You are not a new person, you are just replacing your. However, whereas ONE INDIVIDUAL can legally make that decision, there is no way to say the same for a whole people of almost 2 million.</dd>

No doubt about it and the term Bosniak means just that in English too. Actually it is used as an adjective in French <i>bosniaque</i> (for <i>Bosnian</i> no such thing as <i>bosnien</i>) and I believe that in the 19th century English Bosnia<b>c</b> was used much more frequently than Bosnia<b>n</b>. -- <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgor_b7e8.html" title="User:Igor">Igor</a> 4:31, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The spellings Belorussia and Byelorussia are transliterations of the name from the Russian language and should be considered obsolete.</i> (...) <i>Some Belarusians perceive the name "Byelorussia" as derogatory, as a vestige of Russian and Soviet imperialism and policies of russification. Therefore they speak strongly in favor of the name "Belarus".</i></dd>
<dd>Another example of a nation excercising their right to choose their own name. And BTW no, Belarusian is not a person that wears white clothes, and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poljak</a> is not a person living in the field.

<dd>It is possible that the term Bosniak once meant the same as Bosnian, but it doesn't for a long time now. A person that uses that meaning should be corrected. Bosniak is sufficiently different from Bosnian in all languages AFAIK. Besides, I fail to see the relevance of this to our original discussion - whether pages mentioning Bosnian Muslims can be edited to mention Bosniaks if the events described there happened before 1993/Dayton. --<a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 22:35, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>M.H., I'm starting to think that we need a separate article titled "Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina" or "Ethnical history..." or something like that. That will enable us to delete much of the superfluous crap implanted in this and other articles, and to present facts in a thorough way. Your text can be a solid basis for something like that - although I disagree with some of the remarks it's a vast improvement over what we have now.
<dl>
<dd>OK, but this is ambitious, and hardly an issue all interested "parties" will agree upon. Anyway- for starters, you may excise parts on Croats and Serbs &amp; leave something on Bosniaks (or rephrase it, doesnt matter).

<p>This crap about denial of national self-identification to Bosniaks (former Bosnian Muslims) got to stop. They (muslims who are native speakers of what is now called "central South Slavic diasystem") are officially called Bosnaks now. Their "genetic lineage" is irrelevant, since a great part of contemporary Bosnia's Bosniaks are of Croatian (I mean Croatia's Croatian) descent, because in the 17th and 18th century ca. 30-40% of muslim population of Bosnia was composed of immigrants who fled from newly liberated areas of Croatia (Lika, Dalmatia, Slavonia). Therefore, no need to ponder on ethnic origin of Bosniaks in Montenegro and Serbia (Sandžak), where there are ca. 250-300 k Bosniaks max, because the origin is irrelevant to a person's national self-identification. If Croatia's gvt. would like to press the question a bit more, there would be no Serbs in Croatia (ca. 200 k inhabitants), but "Vlachs". This ethno-genetic fiction is history. Be they of diffused "Bosnian", Croatian, Serbian, Hungarian, Turkish, Vlach, Albanian, ...whatever descent- they are now Bosniaks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User:Bosniak's version</span></h2>
<p><b>Bosniaks</b> (also spelled: Bosniacs; sometimes incorrectly refered to as <i>Bosnian Muslims</i>) are indigenous Slavic peoples of Bosnia. Up until the mid 19th century, the term <b>Bosniak</b> (natively: <i><b>Bošnjaci</b></i>) was used for all inhabitants of Bosnia regardles of faith.</p>
<p>In medieval Bosnia, <b>Bosniaks</b> were largely members of an indigenous Bosnian Church and were considered heretics by both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. As a result, some <b>Bosniaks</b> were forced to convert to Caholicism and Eastern Orthodox religions. During the Ottoman period (15th-19th century) mostly heretic <b>Bosniaks</b> in large numbers converted to Islam.</p>
<p>During the 19th century (Austro-Hungarian period), the <b>Bosniaks</b> of Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faiths acquired Croatian and Serbian national identites and came to be known as <b>Bosnian Croats</b> and <b>Bosnian Serbs</b>.</p>
<p>In terms of religion, today's <b>Bosniaks</b> are overhelmingly Sunni Muslims. <b>Bosniaks</b> are also considered to be one of the most secular European nations. Their mother tongue is Bosnian, which is one of three official languages of Bosnia-Herzegovina. <b>Bosniaks</b> are proud of their unique history, tradition, and European roots.</p>

<p>The earliest known inhabitants of the area now known as <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> were the Illyrians, who spoke a language related to modern Albanian. The Romans conquered Illyria after a series of wars, and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>-speaking settlers from all over the empire settled among the Illyrians. The Roman province of Dalmatia included Herzegovina and most of Bosnia, and a strip of northern Bosnia, south of the Sava River, was part of the province of Pannonia. Modern Albanians trace their ancestry to the ancient Illyrians, and the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>, a historically nomadic people who live throughout the Balkans, speak a language derived from Latin, and are thought to be the descendants of Roman settlers and Romanized Illyrians.</p>
<p>The Germanic <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goths.html" title="Goths">Goths</a> conquered Roman Dalmatia in the 5th Century, and later the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alans.html" title="Alans">Alans</a>, who spoke an Iranian language, and the Turkic <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avars.html" title="Avars">Avars</a> passed through what is now Bosnia. These invaders left few linguistic traces, and whatever remnant populations were left behind were absorbed by the Slavic wave that was to follow.</p>
<p>Slavs settled in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and the surrounding lands, which were then part of the Eastern Roman Empire, in the 7th century. The Slavic <b>Bosniaks</b> settled settled sometime after the first wave of Slavs; The Serb settled in what is now central Serbia, and Croats established a kingdom in what is now central Croatia. <b>Bosniaks</b> established their own Bosnian kingdom between the 12th and the 15th century. The final Turkish conquest in 1463 marked the end of an independent Bosnia and the beginning of the influence of Islamic Civilization.</p>
<p>As the Ottoman Empire began to contract after the defeat at Vienna in 1683, many Muslim refugees from the lost Ottoman territories in Croatia, Slavonia, Hungary, and, later, Serbia found refuge in Bosnia, and were assimilated into the local <b>Bosniak</b> population.</p>
<p>In 1878, Bosnia and Herzegovina were occupied and administered by <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and a number of <b>Bosniaks</b> left Bosnia and Herzegovina. Official Austro-Hungarian records show that 56,000 people emigrated between 1883 and 1920, but the number of emigrants is probably larger, as they don't reflect emigration before 1883, and don't include those who left without permits. One geographer estimates that there are now over 5 million descendants of <b>Bosniaks</b> in Turkey, although that figure includes the descendants of <b>Bosniaks</b> who emigrated from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> as well. Another wave of emigration occurred after the end of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, when Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, known after 1929 as <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>.</p>
<p>In an attempt to assimilate <b>Bosniaks</b> into Serbs and Croats, in 1968 Yugoslav communists recognized <b>Bosniaks</b> as Muslims "in national sense." In September 1993, after decades of communist Yugoslav oppression and denial of <b>Bosniak</b> nation, the Congress of Bosniak Intellectuals in war torn Sarajevo reafirmed <b>Bosniak</b> identity and returned the historic term <i>Bosniak</i> to <b>Bosniaks</b>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bosniaks constitute 48% of Bosnia-Herzegovina's post war population (<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bk.html" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bk.html" rel="nofollow">CIA FactBook</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bosniak emigration to Turkey</span></h2>
<p>From the article: "Official Austro-Hungarian records show that 56,000 people emigrated between 1883 and 1920, but the number of emigrants is probably larger, as the official record doesn't reflect emigration before 1883, nor include those who left without permits." Mustafa Imamovic in his History of Bosniaks mentions around 150,000 of emigrants. He also says that the number of Muslims declined from 38.73% in 1879. to 32.25% in 1910. An encyclopedia gives total population of 1,158,164 in 1879. and 1,898,044 in 1910. This seems to put the number somewhere between 75,000 and 125,000. <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 17:18, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page still needs improvement. First, I think it's rather unbalanced (in technical sense) as its first part is very short &amp; incomplete while the "History" part is IMO way too long (read: boring).</p>
<p>Re the flag: my understanding is that the flag is more a symbol of SDA political party and Bosniak nationalists rather than the symbol which all Bosniaks identify themselves with. I'm not going to touch it, of course, but I'd appreciate few comments (especially from Vedran, who declares himself an atheist).</p>
<p>The part on Folklore, Traditions and Customs needs much enhancement. When will someone <b>Finally</b> write an article on <a href="../../../s/e/v/Sevdalinka.html" title="Sevdalinka">Sevdalinka</a>? I'd really like to see it. Also, the things mentioned by Asim.</p>

<dd>Duja you raise some good points. Regarding the "unbalanced" part, yeah true, and of course the first half isn't complete yet, I mean it just appeared 3 days ago, but trying to condense the bottom half seems like asking for disaster. I think maybe pictures would make things more bearable. Regarding the flag, (btw I'm an atheist as well) yeah I'm certain that's the Bosniak national flag. It was taken from a very trustworthy site, and the SDA flag does look similar but it's different (SDA flag has SDA written in big block letters next to the crescent). Now granted I never knew about it, and most Bosniaks identify more with the old republic flag, but that seems to be the actual thing. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 16:07, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: Flag: The green flag with crescent is the traditional Bosniak flag and it's in use since the middle ages. I can find some sources for this if you want. There's nothing "Muslim" in the religious sense about this flag or the green color, and Turkish flag as we all know is red, so I don't see why Bosniaks couldn't identify with it.</dd>
<dd>The blue shield with lillies is the coat of arms of the Kotromanics family - and thus the medieval Bosnian kingdom. It was used 1992-1996 as the flag of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Again there's nothing about it that isn't acceptable to Serbs or Croats except that it signifies something they were fighting against. So I think it would be incorrect to call it a Bosniak flag, it's an old flag of B&amp;H. <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 16:34, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We could lose some of the historical part, but if it's gonna lead to stupid simplifications like claiming that Muslims are a different nation from Bosniaks then I'm sorry but we need it all. I'm willing to listen if you have a simpler way of explaining the Bosniak -&gt; Muslim -&gt; "undetermined" -&gt; Muslim -&gt; Bosniak transition that occured in 20th century. <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedran_d37a.html" title="User:Vedran">Vedran</a> 16:41, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)

What <b>is</b> really relevant to this topic is the part on 20th century, when "real" national emancipation took place (I'm not trying to say that Bosniaks are a 20th century invention btw, but I don't think one can really speak about "Bosniak nation" during Ottoman times either). Some material from medieval times should be retained, of course, especially the issue/dispute on the origins of Islamized people. --<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 12:57, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unreliable figures</span></h2>
<p>The figures for Bosnika population, given in the tabel, are very unreliable (to say the least). The number in BH is ca. 1.8 M max (considering les than 100,000 in RS and 1,7 M in Federation)-which can be seen in pdf document in Federation bureau of stats: <a href="http://www.fzs.ba" class="external free" title="http://www.fzs.ba" rel="nofollow">http://www.fzs.ba</a> . The number for Croatia would be ca. 40,000, since Muslims are counted as Bosniaks (a dispute over census), while the number in Turkey is completely superfluous (and "imaginative"), becasue these people are Turks now. It would be just like adding some 50 M Americans of German extraction to the number of Germans. This part of the text is seriously flawed and I suggest that it should be corrected. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 07:04, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not trying to start any arguements, but I respectfully disagree with yours and Mir Harven's view on the issue. Personal experience and very strong communal feeling show that the overwhelming majority of the Bosniak diaspora are indeed Bosniaks, and not Americans or Swedes or whatever. Really, if theyre not Bosniaks then what are they. Americans? Swedes? Such descriptions would be far less accurate and insulting to many of them. Thousands of them visit the country every year, they have often played a considerable role in its development, and many plan to return. The Bosniak situation is also considerably different because 95% of them left the country only in the past 15 years or so. Are there some (usually children) who dont speak the language? Yes. Are there some that arent very involved with their home country? Yes. But to deny the existance of the few hundred thousand Bosniaks outside of the Balkans under the circumstances, and especially when many other articles about ethnicity do exactly the same, is simply wrong. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 19:01, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone reduced the figure of Bosniaks in Montenegro - I restored to the official census number of 63,000, and was wondering if it shouldn't also include the 29,000 <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims_by_nationality.html" title="Muslims by nationality">Muslims by nationality</a> - which makes the total more consistent with the pre-war number.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent changes by Jugoslaven</span></h2>
<p>Three points have been the topic of this edit war, and I agree with Asim Led that Jugoslaven needs to substantiate his changes, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bosniaks have officially decided on Bosnian, obsoleting Serbo-Croatian</li>
<li>Bosnian did not cease to be mostly mutually intelligible with its south Slavic neighbours; in fact, it's ludicrous to try to revert this change and imply that it's all the same, and at the same time avoid saying that it's all rather similar</li>
<li>Meša Selimović was a Bosnian Muslim before he became a naturalized Serb, and all such people are considered to belong to Bosniak heritage</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Janissaries continued until early 19th century</span></h2>
<p>I don't know how such an obvious mistake was made but it was. I am talking about Ottoman army becoming a full professional army and "Janissary" becoming only a title in the middle of 17th Century. This could not have been further from the truth. The Janissary system continued until early 19th century and it took a small civil war and an executed sultan to get rid of it. Ottoman army was never all professional, but Janissaries themselves were professional soldiers although not necessarily by choice initially. Why is there such a long section on Janissaries in an article about Bosniaks and why it contains these obvious errors, it is hard to understand.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">genetics</span></h2>
<p>I assume this research refers to the same thing Dragan Primorac has been talking about recently. If so, the statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As it stands, current studies have shown that, genetically, Bosniaks are largely indigenous and have a large fraction of the ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This statement is fairly tendentious and premature, given that the researchers still found that many Slavic peoples are "largely similar". Also, it lacks a discussion on whether it was the Persian, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alans.html" title="Alans">Alan</a> genes of the ancient nomadic tribes described as predecessors to the Croats and Serbs that had mixed with the Illyrians which makes up the "bulk" of the current gene pool.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I think that this is the same study that Primorac has recently talked about. I admit I'm no expert on genetics, but as for that line you quoted I just slightly rephrased a line from the actual study. The actual line said that all three groups had a "large fraction of the ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area", but since this is an article about Bosniaks I wasn't sure whether it was necessary to mention the other two groups in the concluding sentence.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for the Persian/Alan/Slavic genes, I'm not 100% sure, but they were mentioned in discussions about the findings. I'm not sure how those factors could form the "bulk" of the current gene pool when the "dinaric" sub-halo group has such a high frequency (71%, 44%). It makes much more sense that the "ancient nomaditc tribes described as predecessors to the Croats and Serbs" were numerically far smaller than the Illyrians and other indigenous people, and that they merely culturally and linguistically assimilated them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can't figure out what exactly I meant from that sentence, but in an attempt to reconstruct it :) I noticed the word "ancient" - when talking about this study this kind of a word is confusing because most of the referenced groups are ancient. I think that was what I was aiming at - both the Illyrians and the Alans could have been ancient.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reasons for current change - Attempt for consensus</span></h2>
<p>Obviously the original religion is a point of disagreement, so i put that into the intro as a temporary compromise solution. And so i suggest we leave the text as is for the moment, until we reach consensus on the content.</p>
<p>As for a possible consensus, let me start off with a few points.</p>
<ul>
<li>The original religion of Bosniaks is in principle encyclopedic, and should, imho, be valid for inclusion on the article, with a few things in mind
<ol>
<li>It should be better documented and referenced</li>
<li>It is not relevant for the <i>current</i> use of the term Bosniak, and should imho not be placed in the intro.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the term Bosniak is used loosely and widely as simply 'of Islamic descent', their original religion seems, to me, to be mainly of historical interest. Perhaps a section along those lines should be added further down.</p>
<p>One general note though: we all know the sensitivities of editing stuff like this. Literature on any topic, written by any source concerning former Yugoslavia is bound to be at least somewhat POV. Lets try to keep it civil and not include all kinds of things in the article before ít has been discussed here. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War">The Minister of War</a> 12:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "original religion of Bosniaks" <i>is</i> discussed later in the article. The medieval history subsection has a good paragraph or so on the subject of the Bosnian church, the presence of Catholicism and Orthodoxy, and the Bogomil theory. The subject <i>is</i> covered adequately and in a NPOV matter: <b>there really shouldn't be any problem here</b>. A debate or compromise isn't necessary here because it's a clear case of right and wrong. The anonymous user, and his various identities, are doing little more than vandalizing a perfectly fine introduction. Furthermore, this user has repeatedly personally insulted me and violated basic rules of Wikipedia (See <a href="../../../e/m/i/User_talk%7EEmir_Arven_dfe8.html" title="User talk:Emir Arven">User talk:Emir_Arven</a>) The user should be punished for his disruptive behavior and the article should be returned to the way it was.

<dd>In my opinion, it's vital to keep a cool head in an editing dispute. I agree there shouldnt be a problem here but would like to hear what other users - who evidently disagree with us both on this - have to say.

<li>Clear arguments will be summed up to change the introduction OR</li>
<li>The claims of those users will be found baseless</li>
</ol>

<p>Several anon changes have completely changed the face of this article, trying to sell the unconfirmed theses on "bogomilism" and "nativeness" and deleting both the data on pre-Slavic population and christianization of Orthodoxes and Catolics. This is a hoax difficult to cope with. I'm not a Bosniak, but I don't try to deny Bosniak nationality nor to oppose <b>reasonable</b> theories on the origin, but this is going too far. We're having anon nationalists trying to establish, paraphrasing, "Bosniak origin from amoebas". Generally, I hesitate to edit other nation's pages, but this time I'll make an exception and revert to the version that stuck around for quite a while and which is IMO reasonable.<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 09:17, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As Emir this time asked nicely, I will respond nicely. In what is sometimes called Central South Slavic diasystem, there are several ways to create name for residents of a territory from the name of the territory. One is by adding -ac: Kuba/Kubanac, Portugalija/Portugalac, Amerika/Amerikanac, Bosna/Bosanac. Another one is by adding -'nin: Irak/Iracanin, Dakija/Dacanin, Trakija/Tracanin, Bosna/Bosnjanin. So you can see that Bosnjanin means exactly the same thing as Bosanac. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 12:45, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kulin Ban U svojoj Povelji Dubrovčanima 1332. godine on piše: "....Ako ima Dubrovčanin koju pravdu na Bošnjaninu,da ga pozove pred gospodina bana...". Ovo je vrlo značajan dokument, jer govori da u Bosni žive jedino Bošnjani i niko drugi (naziv "Bošnjani"je starinski naziv za Bošnjake)<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 20:37, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Poznata je krilatica "Od Kulina Bana i dobrijeh dana"... koja ima svoju potporu u činjenici da Bosna za vrijeme Kulina Bana ekonomski prosperira baš trgujući sa Dubrovnikom... a u tome vremenu nastaje i najstariji pronađeni Bosanski državni dokument, poznat pod nazivom "POVELJA BOSANSKOGA BANA KULINA", a koji datira iz 1189. godine i predstavlja neku vrstu trgovačkog ugovora sa Dubrovčanima. U ovom dokumentu po prvi put neko, u ovom slučaju Kulin Ban, kaže da je Bosna nezavisna država sa svojim narodom, vladarom itd. U ovo doba kada se i hrišćanstvo dijeli na pravoslavlje i katoličanstvo, Bošnjani se nežele priključiti rimokatoličkoj ili grčko-pravoslavnoj crkvi. Mjesto toga oni osnivaju Bosansku Crkvu koja većinom slijedi bogumilska učenja. Bogumilstvo je bilo posebna vrsta hrišćanstva u kojem se rane Isusa Hrista gledaju samo kao simbolične, moli se klanjanjem 5 puta na dan, zabranjuje se ikonografija i mnoge druge raznolikosti od normanlog hrišćanstva. Vijest o da su Bošnjani prihvatili bogumilsku vjeru pa i organizovali vjersku instituciju koja je slijedi i postaje centar bogumilstva u svijetu sa time što se govorilo čak da postoji "bogumislki Papa" u Bosni nije sa dobrotom primljena u Rimu.<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 20:37, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Fact is that half of the "kings" you have provided above weren't even bosnian kings for example Stephen Ostojic, he was never king of bosnia. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>
<p>The reliablity of the sources you have provided may very well be disputed since they all are memberstripod webpages, that is by other words private amateuristic websites. But however suggesting these sources and statements are correct, it does not mean anything that SOME (most didn't) of the kings proclaimed themselves as kings of serbs, this was due to multiple marriges between different kings and queens from different countries even between bosnia and serbia. I was not often in those days that any king or queen was completly from one country in heritage.<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 12:25, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That they declared themselves as kings of serbia may also be explained by the fact that after tvrtko helped serbs build up a kingdom free of hungarians it became sort of a rule that any bosnian king from tvrtko and so on would be declared as the kings of serbs but not serbia since they didn't have any terretorial rights to the serb land but they did have rights against the serbian people. So when the kings declared themselves as kings of bosnia this ment Kings of the bosnian people (bosnjani) and as well kings of Bosnia (terretorial), and with the part "kings of serbs" only the people and not the terretory. Easily explained they were the despots over serbia. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 11.00, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually Kulin Bans povelja is just one of many letters and instances where the nationality Bosnjanin is expressed.

<p>As for the part of "helping build up serbia", I will not elaborate into details but Kotromanic assisted serbia in its independence from hungary - giving him the "privilegeum" of calling himself king of serbia as well. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 00:00, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly. There are numerious mentions of <b>Bošnjani</b>. For that second part; Serbia had a vast <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">Empire</a> that died out with the extinction of its dynasty, several years before Tvrtko's crowning. There was no need to free from Hungary since Hungary didn't rule Serbia.

<p>Regarding the issue of the number of Bosniaks in Turkey today. On the internet there are websites and forums regarding the issue of Bosniaks in Turkey. Feel free to do some research on google or whatever. Regarding the numbers of Bosniaks in Turkey you will probably find most of it on forums where people mostly Turks and Bosniaks talk about the Bosniak origin of Turks. Numbers range from 300,000 - 5 million Turks with somewhat Bosniak origin maybe one ancestor maybe several. Note, this is written by Turks who live in Turkey and who have learned about this in school regarding the Ottoman withdrawl from the Balkans and the arrival of Bosniak and Albanian immigrants. Also, these people know other people with Bosniak ancestory and they can also name places and neighbourhoods within Turkey where many Bosniaks settled when they arrived and still live today e.g. parts of Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa etc. - <a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZec_424b.html" title="User:Zec">Zec</a> 16:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind – quite the opposite – including that info in the article. Someone should dig out some real research data though. However, I oppose the "counting blood cells" method (see e.g. <a href="../../../i/v/a/Talk%7EIvan_Gunduli%C4%87_0931.html" title="Talk:Ivan Gundulić">Talk:Ivan Gundulić</a>) – if there were e.g. 300,000 Bosniak emmigrants to Turkey in 1920, with some simple math and reasonable assumptions that many of them mixed with "native" Turks, one can easily get the number of several millions of their descendents. The question is, do they identify as Bosniaks today and how many of them do? How many are aware of their Bosniaks origins? I don't know how the Turkish census counts ethnicities though, but some official estimates would be really welcome. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 16:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Someone has asked me to comment on a link and website that claims the number of Bosniaks in Turkey. As much as I would like to know how many Bosniaks are in Turkey I would like for that number to be accurate and not a guess. A site that was provided has some serious credibility issues. As I have pointed out to Damir as well, if a website is pushing maps like this <a href="http://www.eurominority.org/version/eng/minority-detail.asp?id_pays=8&amp;id_minorites=ba-serb" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eurominority.org/version/eng/minority-detail.asp?id_pays=8&amp;id_minorites=ba-serb" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> as depicting Republika Srpska as part of Serbia (Which is not the first time I've seen it; which is a nationalistic concoction being dragged around to push certain agenda and not merely just noting areas where Serbs are in majority) and while it classifies Serbs and Croats as minority (while technically correct but officially they are constituent people), such site deserves a second look and a critical eye. Furthermore I was unable to find any information about the site's official capacity and how it found information on numbers of Bosniak minority in Turkey except that it uses extension .org as its credibility (every schmuck can register that extension). Unless there is a secondary source to confirm this one I am against using this website as a sole source for this topic.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:16, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is an ethnic-majority map (cf. Albanians) rather than political one, but the general problem with that site is that it doesn't offer really much information about anything. The minorities (and "minorities") are listed all right, but the information within templates is scarce, and the taxonomy is bad; more than half of the data about any minority is marked with question marks. It lacks the key data about political status, history, self-determination, origin etc. I don't think that Serbs (and Croats) in Bosnia should be listed as "minority". I concur that it's not the best site to be used as reference. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 15:40, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The second part of it (word is "Bosniaque" - Bosniak - Bosnia.) is incomprehensible. These are three words as I see.</li>
<li>Even if it were correct, what is it supposed to mean?

<p>I never denied the charter of Ban Kulin. I merely believe that in the context of the article this paragraph is unnecessary and highly POV. Several other users obviously feel the same way.

As you recall the rulers of bosnia reffered to themselves as Bosnjani which is an archaic term of Bosniaks.

However, even if I accept this statement, it doesn't contradict the thesis that Bosnian Serbs and Croats are <b>also</b> descendents of Bošnjani. So, again, she was a Bosnia<b>n</b> but not a Bosnia<b>k</b> (nor, probably, a Serb or a Croat for that matter).

Only thing is that they have abandond their Bosnian ethnicity and decided for the serb or croat one based on their religion - the only ones who still confess them to Bosnianhood are the bosniaks who, at least still, haven't abandond their bosnianhood. I agree that the catholics and orthodoxs of bosnia are indigenous to bosnia, but for God's sake don't call them croats or serbs then because they aren't that. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 16:34, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your arguments, emperor, are straight ludacris, sorry but I do. First off there is no such thing as <b>herzegovinian</b> in an ethnic or even national meaning; Herzegovina was founded in the 15th century as a <b>Bosnian</b> terretory by the <b>Bosnian</b> duke Stjepan Vukčić Kosača. Therefore Herzegovina is simply a <b>part of Bosnia</b> like dalmatia is a part of Croatia. If you ask a "Dalmatian", "what is your nation?" - do you believe he will answer "dalmatian" or Croat?; if you think Dalmatian, you better re-consider. And if you think that a "herzegovinian" would answer anything else but Bosnian/Bosniak you should really start investigating facts instead of making them up. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></dd>

<p>"should we consider Emperor Constantine the Great a Serbian?" As far as I am concerned you may do whatever you like emperor, but comparing Constantine's ethnic relation to serbia to the relation Katarina had to Bosnia is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Katarina was native to Bosnia as the native queen of Bosnia - she spoke Bosnian language and followed Bosnian customs. I "really" wonder if constantine did this with serbia? I guess your argument on this is that "so what if Katarina was born in Bosnia, spoke bosnian language, looked like a bosnian, had bosnian parents and was the queen of bosnia - it doesn't have to make her a bosnian, now has it?" - well "emperor" gosh I don't know perhaps it does after all!. Bosniaks = ethnic Bosnians, Bosnians = to anyone who lives in bosnia, but however in its strictest sense it reffers to ethnic bosnians (bosniaks). Catharine was a bosnian in its strictest sense, a bosniak - which is derived from bosnjanin - and that is exactly what she was and her remainings still are in what grave she ever might lay in. I will no longer have this discussion with you, because I sadly don't have time for it, but I appreciate you took the time to discuss. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>

<dd>The problem with that information is that it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. There were many Bosniak emmigrants to Turkey indeed, but (apart from a relatively small wave during Bosnian War) most of them are assimilated, having forgotten the language, accepted Turkicized surnames, made mixed marriages with native Turks etc. In other words, <i>you can't count them unambiguously</i>—at what point someone stops being a Bosniak and becomes a Turk—or, at what point someone stops being an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish.html" title="Irish">Irish</a> and becomes an American? This is a general problem with any diaspora, not just Bosniak one. <b>You can't find the numbers, because it's impossible to count</b>. I suggest that we mention the Turkish diaspora in the infobox (estimated number of emigrants during 1878-1940 and 1990s can probably be found), but refrain from providing any numbers (because they will inherently be wrong). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 09:29, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Findings of the Origins of Bosniaks</span></h2>
<p>"Yes my good man, Bosniaks are the slavicized descendants of Illyrians. Only bosniaks and albanians accepted Islam in large scale, "Bosnia" stems from illyrian "Bosona" (meaning running water) and bosniaks are much more similiar to albanians than to serbs or croats. Yes bosnian serbs and bosnian croats look exactly as Bosniaks, more than albanians do, but this is because bosnian serbs and bosnian croats are simply Catholic Bosniaks and Orthodox Bosniaks. Even the real croats,from croatia, consider the bosnian croats to actually be only Catholic Bosnians and not Croats. Allthoug the croat government is lying about this because they want to claim Bosnian lands. Remember Bosnian croats were Bosniaks as late as in the 19th century when they suddenly changed ethnicity to croats because of religion." Damir Mišić 22:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to DAMIR MISIC's Findings I believe This is quintessential information that must be including, therefore i suggest the bosniak article should mention some where that Bosniaks are actually Albanians who took up Slavic culture.</p>

<dd>Please stop with all that aryan theories crap. Just like Serbs and Croats and Bulgarians and..., Bosniaks descend from population of Slavic settlers mixed with native Illyrian, Dacian and whatever tribes, and accepted the Slavic language. It is primarily <b>the language</b> which makes us all "Slavs", <b>not the amount of Q and W genes inherited from whoever were our ancestors</b>. Population we know today as Bosniaks differs from their Serb and Croat neighbors <b>only because their ancestors accepted Islam</b> unlike Serbs and Croats who accepted Orthodox and Catholic Christianity. Some did it immediately in 15th century, many others did it during the course of Ottoman rule. As <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nations_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_7934.html" title="Nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina">Nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Church_04d9.html" title="Bosnian Church">Bosnian Church</a> article describe, Bosniaks and Albanians accepted Islam because, due to politic and social conditions in these areas, the Christian church influence was weak and Islam had a fertile ground to prosper.

<p>Haha, your say that, yet you are so naive to think that only the Bosniaks are pure illyarian, while Croats and Serbs are Pure Slavs who did not mix with the native populations. Please, Croats and Serbs could also push for the claim, "they are decendants of illyarians", but it is only the Bosniaks that do so, because they are in denial about there croat and serb tribe ancestry, so they use the illyarian theory to distinguish themselves, when evryone knows that both eastern and western christianity was weak in the modern day province of bosnia, as a result heretics formed, such a bogomils,bosnian church,etc and these heretics were easily converted to islam, and as a result you have today a modern day bosniak nation who, through 500 years of ottoman rule, devloped and lost all affinity to their mother country Croatia and lessor extent Serbia, through there privelged postion in Bosnian society--Jadran 07:10, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Porijeklo. Većina Bošnjaka prihvata jedan <b>mit</b> o porijeklu, koji vodi u njihovu etnogenezu u srednjem vijeku. <b>Popularna legenda je jednostavna, privlačna i nedvosmislena</b>. Nakon doseljavanja na Balkanski poluotok u šestom i sedmom stoljeću, priča kaže, da su stanovnike Bosne koji su govorili slavenskim jezikom, pokrstili kršćanski misionari iz Rima na zapadu i Konstantinopola na istoku. Bosanci, koji nisu htjeli pripasti pod katolike ili pravoslavne, stvorili su svoju crkvu i mnogi su vjernici prihvatili dualističku herezu, poznatu kao bogumilstvo. Srednjovjekovna bosanska država pod vodstvom Kulina bana (vladao od 1180-1204) i kralja Tvrtka (vladao 1353-91) zauzimala je velika prostranstva. Ona je stvorila sigurno uporište za Crkvu bosansku i bogumilske heretike. Nakon osmanskog osvajanja Bosne (završeno 1463), bogumili i plemstvo srednjovjekovne Bosne je en masse primilo islam i postali su bosanski Muslimani, pripadnici grupe, koja je danas poznata kao Bošnjaci.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>U Historiji Bošnjaka Mustafa Imamović zauzima nešto drukčiji stav o bošnjačkoj etnogenzi i ne negira popularni mit. On citira brojne (recentne studije o Crkvi bosanskoj i <b>zaključuje da se malo zna o doktrinama, ostavljajući otvorenim pitanje, da li je crkva bila uporište bogumilske hereze</b>. Više se zna o hijerarhiji i strukturi Crkve bosanske i Imamović tvrdi da je crkvena organizacija podržavala etnopolitički razvoj srednjovjekovne bosanske države.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Imamović je primanje islama u Bosni ocrtao kao duži proces (a nije bio brz) i sa malim izuzetcima bio je dobrovoljan. On citira mnoge recentne studije, koje se osnivaju na osmanskim dokumentima popisivanja stanovništva i izvještajima katoličkih vizitatora, da pokaže kako se <b>primanje islama odvijalo postepeno</b>, od 1450-tih do početka sedamnaestog stoljeća. Nadalje, <b>oni koji su primili islam dolazili su iz sve tri kršćanske vjeroispovijesti: katoličanstva, pravoslavlja i Crkve bosanske</b>. On je odbacio spoznaju da je bosansko srednjovjekovno plemstvo en masse primilo islam, da sačuva svoje posjede i privilegije, on tvrdi, da je sultan davao zemlju samo onima koji su u bitkama služili Carstvu. On ne hvali hipoteze o rapidnom i prisilnom primanju islama, što su neki historičari zastupali i izjavljuje, da se ovim želi diskreditirati autentičnost bošnjačke nacionalnosti.</i></dd>

<p>"One observer in the 16th century even mentioned that the Sultan believed Bosniaks were "the best, most pious and most loyal people" and "much bigger, more handsome, and more able" than other Muslim peoples. Though the devsirme system probably didn't influence the demographics of Bosnia significantly, it did firmly establish the Slavic element and language in Istanbul's administration and provided Bosnia with local Bosniak governors from 1488 onward."</p>

<p>I would like to have a domain area expert (i.e. someone with deep knowledge of genetics) perform an NPOV check on the genetics part of this article. It seems that the results of the research are being intentionally misinterpreted to push a particular view point.</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to have someone explain how a frequency of a certiain halo group or a sub-halo group can lead to the conclusion that a given ethnic group is indiginous in some geographic area. My knowledge regarding geneological genetic testing is not very strong, but according to this article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/" class="external free" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/</a> we can not use genetic testing to deterime the origin or our ancient ancestors.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll have to say that I kind of agree with this user. I do, allthough, think that ancestors can be decided in some extent by genetictests but, however, not by the methods available now. Furthermore I have to say that the frequency of dinaric genes is <b>not</b> equal to indigenousness in the balkan area; dinarics can also be found in large amounts among ukrainans and german people, while the dinaric frequency, at the same time, is almost zero among native balkans peoples like greeks and albanians. So my conclusion is that high frequency of dinaric genes is <b>not</b> equal to indiginousness in balkan or mediteranian area. We should in some way rewrite that part of the article. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 21:53, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The genetics section now contains a contradiction. First it asserts "It should, however, be mentioned that "Dinaric genes" are not indicative of indigenousness to the Balkan or Mediterranean areas.". Then it concludes with "As it stands, current studies have shown that, genetically, Bosniaks are largely indigenous and have a large fraction of the ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area." I have removed the later sentance in order to eliminate the contradiction.</dd>
