<p>The Boston College men's <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> team has its origins in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, and the squad has played, through the 2005-06 season, 68 seasons of hoops. In 1904, a men's varsity team was sanctioned and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">December 26</a> of that year BC played its first-ever game, losing 8-6 to Battery H of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">Navy</a>, and won its first-ever game that season against <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tufts_University_160e.html" title="Tufts University">Tufts</a>, 23-17, in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medford%2C_Massachusetts_3188.html" title="Medford, Massachusetts">Medford</a>. Basketball, not a popular sport at the turn of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, suffered through years of weak fan support and only lasted three initial seasons before being dropped. A brief revival in the early <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> brought the men's team back, but it was dropped again following the 1924-25 season. Finally, following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> when the sport began to really take off in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the basketball team became permanent in the 1945-46 season.</p>
<p>Boston College has neither won a national title in basketball nor advanced as far as the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Four_ffdd.html" title="Final Four">Final Four</a>, but has made its mark on the national scene several times with both positive and bad press. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> BC hired <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Celtics_b035.html" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a> legend <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Cousy_6456.html" title="Bob Cousy">Bob Cousy</a> as head coach, and in his six years as coach the Eagles earned postseason berths in five of those years including a trip to the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elite_Eight_96e4.html" title="Elite Eight">Elite Eight</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. Through the years Boston College has hired several other notable coaches including <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Daly_2b60.html" title="Chuck Daly">Chuck Daly</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Davis_%28basketball%29_5657.html" title="Tom Davis (basketball)">Dr. Tom Davis</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Williams_9099.html" title="Gary Williams">Gary Williams</a> and former Eagle, Jim O'Brien '71.</p>
<p>In one of the darkest stories in BC history, several members of the 1978-79 basketball team were accused of being involved in a <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_shaving.html" title="Point shaving">point-shaving</a> scandal that drew national attention due to the involvement of the infamous <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> associate <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Hill_%28mobster%29_1f90.html" title="Henry Hill (mobster)">Henry Hill</a>; one player, Rick Kuhn, was found guilty and served time in jail for his efforts in the fix.</p>
<p>Boston College basketball, however, would be forever changed as a charter member of the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_Conference_f830.html" title="Big East Conference">Big East Conference</a>, which formed in time for the 1979-80 season. With more national exposure and better competition — leading to improved and more expansive recruiting — BC had ensured itself of an opportunity to compete at the highest level of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> Division I basketball every year.</p>
<p>From the time the seven original Northeastern schools formed the Big East, the BC men's basketball team saw several highs: Advancing to the Elite Eight in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_0dc9.html" title="1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1982 NCAA Tournament</a>, winning the Big East Tournament in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, four Big East Coach of the Year awards, three Big East Player of the Year awards and a memorable win over No. 1-ranked <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men%27s_basketball_0923.html" title="North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball">North Carolina</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_5bdd.html" title="1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1994 NCAA tourney</a>.</p>
<p>Among Boston College's biggest non-conference rivalies in basketball are <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_the_Holy_Cross_150d.html" title="College of the Holy Cross">Holy Cross</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst_5351.html" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">University of Massachusetts</a>. The Eagles and the Crusaders have met 109 times — with their first game played on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>. The Cross owns a 57-52 all-time edge in the series with BC having won 15 of the last 16 games. First played in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> and held annually since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, BC's basketball rivalry with <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst_5351.html" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">UMass</a> is called the "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Classic_9e9d.html" title="Commonwealth Classic">Commonwealth Classic</a>" and was played on several occasions at what is now known as <a href="../../../t/d/_/TD_Banknorth_Garden_57ea.html" title="TD Banknorth Garden">TD Banknorth Garden</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. The Eagles are 22-17 against its cross-state rival. The Boston College men's basketball team have made 16 overall appearances in the NCAA tournament including three trips to the Elite Eight and have been to the NIT 10 times. BC has produced 4 conference players of the year: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bagley_c366.html" title="John Bagley">John Bagley</a> '83, was the Big East Player of the Year in 1980-1981, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Bell_4f50.html" title="Troy Bell">Troy Bell</a> '03 was co-Big East Player of the Year in 2000-2001, and won the title outright in 2002-2003, and <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jared_Dudley_f2c5.html" title="Jared Dudley">Jared Dudley</a> '07 was the ACC Player of the Year in 2006-2007.

<p>On March 26, 1986, Jim O'Brien '71 returned to coach the <strong class="selflink">Boston College Eagles basketball</strong> team. Despite a bitter end to his tenure as head coach, O'Brien has been credited with resuscitating the BC basketball team, which — aside from some success in the early 80s — had not been a consistent NCAA tournament team since the 1960s. Although O'Brien did build a solid program, his timing was excellent: Boston College opened its new hockey and basketball arena, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conte_Forum_58f5.html" title="Conte Forum">Conte Forum</a>, in 1988, (fully equipped with state-of-the-art facilities); the Big East had reached its zenith when O'Brien took the reigns with conference teams winning national championships in 1984 and 1985; and O'Brien and BC, at the time, were still feeling the positive effects of the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Flutie Factor</a> with Boston College athletics increasing in national exposure.</p>
<p>Boston College played its final season in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberts_Center_dbd2.html" title="Roberts Center">Roberts Center</a> in the 1987-88 season and were invited to the NIT, advancing to the semi-finals before being knocked-off by regional rival <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_Huskies_a8c0.html" title="Connecticut Huskies">UConn</a>, 73-67. BC returned to the NIT in 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>In 1994, the Eagles were blown out by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown_Hoyas_basketball_a30e.html" title="Georgetown Hoyas basketball">Georgetown</a> 81-58 in the first round of the Big East tournament. But, following its invitation to the NCAA's, the men's basketball team went on one of its most historic runs. Boston College downed <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_Cougars_f872.html" title="Washington State Cougars">Washington State</a> in the opening round of the tourney. In the second round, BC had its memorable upset of defending national champion North Carolina, 75-72, pushing them to the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Sixteen_%28NCAA_Basketball_Tournament%29_1b38.html" title="Sweet Sixteen (NCAA Basketball Tournament)">Sweet Sixteen</a> and, after a victory over <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Knight_b827.html" title="Bob Knight">Bobby Knight</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Hoosiers_9e4d.html" title="Indiana Hoosiers">Indiana</a>, they went back to the Elite Eight where they fell to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Gators_7d0d.html" title="Florida Gators">Florida</a>, 74-66.</p>
<p>Despite all the media hype surrounding UMass during the 1995-96 season when the Minutemen were ranked No. 1 in the country for most of the season and advanced to the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Four_ffdd.html" title="Final Four">Final Four</a>, the Eagles (albeit somewhat forgetably) also made it to the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_0c6f.html" title="1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">Big Dance</a> in 1996. BC finished the year at 19-11, and bowed out in the second round after getting crushed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_775f.html" title="Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets">Georgia Tech</a> 103-89.</p>
<p>Lead by All-Big East forward Danya Abrams and sophomore point guard <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scoonie_Penn_153b.html" title="Scoonie Penn">James "Scoonie" Penn</a> Boston College won the 1997 Big East Tournament with victories over <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">Pitt</a>, Georgetown and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova_University_d98e.html" title="Villanova University">Villanova</a>. For its Big East Tournament championship, BC received an automatic bid to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_b1d6.html" title="1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">The Dance</a> and met <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valparaiso_Crusaders_9719.html" title="Valparaiso Crusaders">Valparaiso</a>. The Eagles knocked off its first-round opponent 73-66, but fell in the second round to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph%27s_University_ab8f.html" title="Saint Joseph's University">St. Joe's</a> when the Hawks eked out an 81-77 win.</p>
<p>Controversy erupted after the 1997 season closed as Jim O'Brien and the Boston College administration sparred over academic grounds in recruiting athletes. O'Brien filed a law suit against BC on the grounds of breach of contract and slander. The case was settled out of court.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Following a bitter end to his tenure, the BC alumnus moved to <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_University_2761.html" title="Ohio State University">Ohio State</a> (and brought his star playmaker Scoonie Penn with him) where O'Brien took the Buckeyes to the Final Four in 1999. Unfotunately, his tenure at Ohio State also ended on bitter terms.</p>

Following three sub-.500 seasons, Skinner lead the Eagles to a Big East-best 27-5 mark in 2000-01 (setting a school record for wins in a season), the Big East tournament title and a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. BC defeated <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Utah_University_532f.html" title="Southern Utah University">Southern Utah</a> in the openeing round of the tourney, but was upset by <a href="../../../u/s/c/USC_Trojans_basketball_56fa.html" title="USC Trojans basketball">USC</a> 74-71 in the second round. Skinner went on to win Big East Coach of the Year honors and star sophomore <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Bell_4f50.html" title="Troy Bell">Troy Bell</a> was named Big East Co-Player of the Year.</p>

Since the inception of the Skinner era, Boston College has seen increased success on the basketball court and has garnered growing national media attention with six consecutive postseason tournament invitations including five to the NCAA tournament. Athletic Director Gene DeFilippo deserves mention as a factor in BC's success on the court as he has been instrumental in the basketball team's widening national exposure. In its first season in ACC, BC advanced to the finals of the league tournament losing by two points to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Blue_Devils_basketball_4629.html" title="Duke Blue Devils basketball">Duke</a>.</p>
<p>Some have argued Skinner's success is predicated on his ability to recruit student-athletes that other schools never bother to look at, so-called "diamonds in the rough." Bell, who grew up in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis</a>, won two Big East Player of the Year awards and is currently the BC all-time leading scorer, fits that description in addition to Ryan Sidney, <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jared_Dudley_f2c5.html" title="Jared Dudley">Jared Dudley</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Williams_%28American_basketball_player%29_1dee.html" title="Sean Williams (American basketball player)">Sean Williams</a>, Sean Marshall and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-American_ecc3.html" title="All-American">All-American</a> forward <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Smith_fa83.html" title="Craig Smith">Craig Smith</a>, a Los Angeles native, who was overlooked by most <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ten_Conference_569b.html" title="Pacific Ten Conference">Pac-10</a> schools.</p>

Through the end of the 2004-05 season, the men's team holds a winning record of .719 since the start of the 2000-01 season. On an interesting note, the Eagles have defeated the defending national champions in each of the last three seasons: <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_Orange_7b3c.html" title="Syracuse Orange">Syracuse</a> 57-54 (on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">03-11</a>), <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_Huskies_a8c0.html" title="Connecticut Huskies">UConn</a> 75-70 (on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">01-05</a>) and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men%27s_basketball_0923.html" title="North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball">UNC</a> 81-74 (on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">01-25</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">03-11</a>).</p>

<p>Though the 2000-01 season was a memorable one for BC and its fans as it re-vamped local interest in the Chestnut Hill men's hoops team, it paled to the national exposure and media attention the Eagles garnered in 2004-05. Starting the year unranked and without one vote in the coaches' poll, Boston College accomplished something no Big East team had done before: it started a season 20-0. In the 20 straight victories, the Eagles beat two ranked opponents and, when they reached the 20-0 mark, were one of only two teams to be undefeated at the time (<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Fighting_Illini_c9df.html" title="Illinois Fighting Illini">Illinois</a> was the other).</p>
<p>The team's first loss occurred at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_5770.html" title="Notre Dame Fighting Irish">Notre Dame</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Following its setback, BC beat unranked <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_26f5.html" title="Rutgers Scarlet Knights">Rutgers</a> and then No. 9 Syracuse on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, vaulting them in the polls to No. 3 in both the AP and coaches' polls — the highest any Boston College basketball team has even been ranked. Finishing the regular season with a 24-3 mark, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_Mountaineers_3c22.html" title="West Virginia Mountaineers">West Virginia</a> bounced BC from the Big East tournament, 78-72, in the second round after the Eagles had drawn a bye in the first due to being the No. 1 overall seed with the league's best record (13-3). Boston College earned an invitation to the 2005 NCAA tournament and received a No. 4 seed, with an opening-round game against <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Quakers_men%27s_basketball_c90b.html" title="Pennsylvania Quakers men's basketball">Penn</a>. The Eagles took care of the Quakers with an 85-65 thrashing and then took on <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Milwaukee_e6ec.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, who had upset <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_athletics_f7b2.html" title="University of Alabama athletics">Alabama</a>. UWM pulled another upset with an 83-75 win over Boston College and sent the Eagles home still unable to get back to the Sweet Sixteen. BC had not advanced past the second round since 1994.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_Eagles_basketball_bc59.html" title="Edit section: Back to the Sweet Sixteen: 2005-06 season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Back to the Sweet Sixteen: 2005-06 season</span></h4>
<p>The men's basketball team played its way to a school-record 28 wins and back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 12 years. Boston College also established itself in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 11 league wins in its first year in the conference, and advanced to the league tournament title game against Duke following wins over Maryland and North Carolina. BC would finish the season ranked No. 7 in the AP poll, which tallies its final poll before the NCAA tournament begins.</p>
<p>Coming into 2005-06, the offseason produced some change to the team as center Nate Doornekamp and sixth man Jermaine Watson graduated. Doornekamp, though not a prolific scorer, was a leader and, with his 7 feet of height, could see the court well and pass the ball with good precision. Watson averaged 9.6 points-per-game off the bench and was a clutch <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_throw.html" title="Free throw">free throw</a> shooter, averaging 83 percent to lead the team.</p>
<p>An offseason incident concerning drug use in May involving center Sean Williams lead to his suspension for the first semester from BC campus and from the team, and his playing status for the entire season was in doubt up until a court hearing in December. Williams set the BC single-season record for blocked shots in 2004-05 with 63. Although not allowed back to Chestnut Hill until the end of the first semester and contingent upon a court hearing, Williams took courses and worked out at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Houston_a03e.html" title="University of Houston">University of Houston</a> in the fall of 2005. He was allowed to return after a Boston judge decided he had fulfilled his commitment and the school gave their approval because he met his academic requirements. Also in trouble was sophomore forward Akida McLain who was suspended from the team for the first seven games of the year for an off-court incident.</p>
<p>Prior to the season, senior forward Craig Smith was voted a first-team All-American, the first BC player to be so honored, and named to the All-ACC preseason team — before even playing one game in the league. Boston College entered its first season in the ACC ranked No. 11 in both major polls and started the year 6-0 and reached as high as No. 6 on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">December 11</a> McLain was reinstated and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a> Williams returned to the team and registered two blocks in his first game back against <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>After starting ACC play with three straight losses (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_Terrapins_5da7.html" title="Maryland Terrapins">Maryland</a>, Georgia Tech, <a href="../../../n/c/_/NC_State_Wolfpack_0c26.html" title="NC State Wolfpack">NC State</a>), senior point guard Louis Hinnant called a players-only meeting which helped to inspire the team to bounce back from a poor conference start. The Eagles rebounded to win four consecutive league wins — winning its first ACC game against <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_Seminoles_cc6a.html" title="Florida State Seminoles">Florida State</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">January 14</a>. After its four straight league wins, BC dropped one to No. 3-ranked <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Blue_Devils_basketball_4629.html" title="Duke Blue Devils basketball">Duke</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>.</p>
<p>Boston College then beat <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_b806.html" title="Virginia Tech Hokies">Virginia Tech</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Forest_University_d590.html" title="Wake Forest University">Wake Forest</a> both on the road, followed by a home win over <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clemson_Tigers_1ab5.html" title="Clemson Tigers">Clemson</a>. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a>, BC downed <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_University_of_New_York_at_Stony_Brook_52d6.html" title="State University of New York at Stony Brook">Stony Brook</a> to reach the 20-win mark for the fifth time in six years. On February 25, Skinner earned his 169th Boston College win when the Eagles downed NC State 74-72 in double overtime, making the former ABA star the winningest coach in BC history. The Eagles finished the 2005-06 regular season with a 24-6 record and ended conference play at 11-5.</p>
<p>Boston College trounced Maryland (after receiving a bye) in the second round of the ACC tournament on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, 80-66, and then edged No. 10 North Carolina 85-82 the next afternoon to advance to the ACC championship game in its first year in the league. No. 3 Duke squeaked out a 78-76 win in a thrilling ACC championship game on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>.</p>
<p>BC earned a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament playing in the Minneapolis bracket, and defeated <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_Pacific_4d5f.html" title="University of the Pacific">Pacific</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a> in a thrilling 88-76 double-OT game. The Eagles trailed by six points with just over two minutes remaining in the initial overtime. Following key three pointers by Dudley and Hinnant, BC went to Smith with only seconds remaining and, after being fouled, the All-ACC forward hit two free throws with four seconds left to tie the game at 74-74. Forcing a second overtime, BC went on a 14-2 run in the second OT to win the game. Against 12th-seeded <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Montana-Missoula_c655.html" title="University of Montana-Missoula">Montana</a>, Boston College won 69-56, advancing to the regional semi-finals for the first time since 1994.</p>
<p>In its Sweet Sixteen matchup against Villanova, BC lost a heartbreaker, 60-59, in overtime. The Eagles lead by as many as 14 points in the first half and controlled much of the initial 35 minutes of the game. But the Wildcats captured their first lead with 2:18 remaining in the second half when Randy Foye hit two free throws to give 'Nova a 49-48 lead, and his layup expanded it to 51-48. With 28 seconds left Dudley dropped a 3-pointer to tie the score.</p>
<p>In an exciting overtime session, a Smith basket gave BC a 59-58 lead. It was later learned that Smith played the entire overtime period with a broken hand. With only seconds remaining, Wildcat forward Will Sheridan slipped past his defender and scored the winning two points on a goaltending call against Sean Willians with 2.3 seconds left. Hinnant's desperation 3 missed at the buzzer — as Nova moved on to the Elite Eight.</p>
