<p>THEY STARTED A FIGHT BECAUSE THEY DID'T PAY FOR THE TEA!"<br />
<br />
India Company was seeing declining profits and had large stocks of tea from China that it could not sell. The British Government passed the Tea Act, which allowed the East India Company to sell tea to the colonies without the usual colonial tax, thereby allowing them to undercut the prices of colonial merchants. <i>This is very odd. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 01:43, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC) My error: I didn't know about the background to the Tea Act of 1773 . Good thing I didn't take rash action on the entry itself eh. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 02:22, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>On December 16, 1773, the night before the tea was due to be landed, the Sons of Liberty, a group of about 60 local Boston residents, possibly organized by Samuel Adams, burst from the South Meeting House and headed toward Griffin's Wharf, dressed as Mohawks. There, three ships—the Dartmouth, the Eleanor and the Beaver—were loaded with crates of tea. The men boarded the ships and began destroying the cargo. By 9 PM, with only one incident, they had smashed 342 crates of tea in all three ships and had thrown them into Boston Harbor. They took off their shoes, swept the decks, and made each ship's first mate attest that they had destroyed only the tea.</i></p>
<p>The whole being dressed up as Indians is a misconecption is it not? Were they not covered in blankets?</p>
<ul>
<li>They were dressed as Indians. If you look here, you can read a personal account of their appearance: <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/teaparty.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/teaparty.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/teaparty.htm</a>. It doesn't mention the word Mohawk, though, and that reference in the article seems a little odd, as I doubt the protesters would have shaved the sides of their heads. Drogue 02:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A group of indignant colonists, led by Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and others, disguised themselves as Native Americans, boarded the ships on the night of Dec. 16, 1773, and threw the tea into the harbor. In reply Parliament passed the Boston Port Bill (See study by B. W. Labaree [1964]).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someone needs to certainly add that back into the article though, as that is a major feature of the event. Btw, the reason they were dressed up as Indians (Native Americans) was because Britain's justification of the abnormally large amount of troops they kept stationed in Boston and other coastal towns was that they were there to protect the colonists. This was obviously just an excuse though, as there were hardly any Indians along the coast (they were a problem further West) and they were stationed there to help keep the raising anti-British sentiment in check. The Boston Tea Partyists thus dressed up as Indians to mock the reasoning of being them being there to "protect them from the Indians". It was meant to be obvious and never had the intent of making people <i>really</i> think they were Indians. I would have added all of that to the article myself, but I'm sure someone else can do a better job at it. Use that information as a base though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I'm less sure about this, but I remember hearing that Britian sends a bill every year for the damages from the Boston Tea Party to the U.S. and every year the U.S. ignores it. That might be an urban legend though, I dunno. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 16:20, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>has anything to do with coffee being (today) a more popular beverage than tea. Sounds like a fourth grade urban legend. The article itself shows that colonists were still importing (smuggled) tea by the boatload. The Boston Tea Party was a important day in dec.16,1773</p>

<p>Most of the material I can find on the Boston Tea Party uses two words: tea party. Furthermore google search results indicate that "tea party" is the more common phrase, and both dictionary.com and answers.com recommend "tea party" when the term "teaparty" is used.</p>

<p><b>While reading, Russell Kirk's The Roots of American Order, I found a very interesting perspective on the Boston Tea Party. It is very different than the stereotypical story taught in American Elementary/Middle Schools.</b></p>
<p><b>Below I will copy direct quotes and my own paraphrasing.</b></p>
<h2><b><a href="../../../r/o/o/Roots_of_American_Order_d7f8.html" title="Roots of American Order">Roots of American Order</a></b></h2>
<p><b>By <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Kirk_004b.html" title="Russell Kirk">Russell Kirk</a></b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER XI</b></p>
<p><b>"<a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration.html" title="Declaration">Declaration</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>"</b></p>
<p>Page 393-394</p>
<p>To understand the Declaration and Constitution its important to understand the “causes of the War for Independence that began in 1775.” Was the war merely fought to “avoid payment of a threepenny duty on a pound canister of tea? If so, the Revolution would have been a bad miscalculation, economically: for material damage to Americans’ property was tremendous during those years of violent conflict, and many of the men who led the resistance to Britain (most especially the planters of the Chesapeake region) lost their fortunes by the war, when not their lives.”</p>
<p>My Opinion: Regardless as to the motivations for the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_Convention_cd5b.html" title="Constitutional Convention">Constitutional Convention</a>, it is clear the motivations for the Revolution in general were not for monetary reasons.</p>
<p>Page 394</p>
<p>“If one judges by modern rates of taxation in America, the economic grievance of the colonies was remarkably insignificant. Moreover, the British government repeatedly had yielded to colonial protests against taxation. The Stamp Act had been repealed; the Townshend duties on imported paper, glass, painters’ colors, and lad had been abandoned; only the Tea Act of 1773 was still in force, when the first shots were fired at Lexington in 1775.”</p>
<p>“And actually that <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_Act_8fde.html" title="Tea Act">Tea Act</a> had reduced the price of tea in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonies.html" title="Colonies">colonies</a>.”</p>
<p>The previous tax in place had been one of “twelvepence a pound on all tea imported to England.” This tea act was actually a ninepence reduction in tax. “The British government’s only purpose in demanding a threepenny tax at American ports was to assert the right of the King in Parliament to levy such duties if he so chose.”</p>
<p>However odd it may seem, “this actual reduction in the price of imported tea was unpopular with certain vigorous Americans, particularly in Boston. For merchants had grown rich by smuggling tea into the colonies, paying no duty at all. Now that the lawful price of tea had fallen, smuggling became unprofitable. In Boston, the well-born demagogue <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Adams_5b99.html" title="Samuel Adams">Samuel Adams</a> was enabled to obtain backing against imperial policy by the respectable tea-smugglers – not because they objected to a high duty on tea, but because they suffered from lowering of the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Duty.html" title="Duty">duty</a>! The Boston Tea party, then, was meant to increase the price of tea, not diminish it.”</p>
<p>“A mad world, my masters: so thought many English friends of the American cause, and so thought <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_%28American_Revolution%29_bf14.html" title="Patriot (American Revolution)">Patriot</a> though he was.”</p>
<p>Pages 394-395</p>
<p>“Certainly the motives of the men who made the Revolution were mixed. Yet the War of Independence was really not fought about cups of tea. The truly fundamental question was whether the Crown in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> might levy taxes upon the Americans without the consent of colonial assemblies.”</p>

<dd>Quoting the first line of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>, <i>"<b>Terrorism</b> is the systematic use or threatened use of violence to intimidate a population or government and thereby effect political, religious, or ideological change."</i>.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a> includes the perspective of the U.S. federal government, <i>"..activities that involve violent... &lt;or life-threatening acts&gt;... that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State and... appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion;"</i></dd>

<dd>Exactly what I was going to say. You took it right out of my mouth. If we label acts of sabotage and direct action taken in the name of environmentalism or animal rights to be terrorism, than we <i>must</i> label this as an act of terrorism, because there is no difference between something like this and destroying an SUV or logging equipment. Both are acts of property destruction designed to create a political response. Please understand that I am <i>not</i> saying the category should be applied here, in fact I think it should not. Classifying anything as an act of terrorism is always going to be controversial, and I am <i>extremely</i> hesitant to do so in cases of property destruction. From what I can tell, including destruction of property in certain (and by no means all) definitions of terrorism is a recent trend designed specifically to target environmentalists and animal rights activists and to over-criminalize their actions. So personally, I don't think this could really be called terrorism, but if we are going to do it with ELF/ALF and other related actions, we should do it here too.

<dd>If it is a precursor to the American revolution then it could be regarded as part of a campaign by the Sons of Libery against the British governement, and thus terrorism. The argument that if people were not targeted then it is not terrorism is fallacious, no one would suggest that when the Provisional IRA phoned in coded warnings, such that people were able to evacuate, prior to the bombings that these were not terrorist acts. Despite the current climate of fear, terrorism is not neccesarily a bad thing: the warsaw uprising was an act of terrorsim against the Nazis; Nelson Mandela was convicted of being a terrorist against the Aparteid regime is South Africa; the sufferagettes engaged in terrorism to gain the franchise. We should not be afraid to call something a terrorist act if it meets all the criteria. To name one group of people you agree with "freedom fighters" and another group that you don't "terrorists" when they perform the same acts, for the same basic motives (the rights of their community against another), is to try and apply your own point of view onto other people. However If we are arguing that the category is wrong because they were neither states nor united at the time of the event, well that is a whole different discussion. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 11:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To my mind, 1-3 are non-violent protests and can not be considered terrorism. 4,5 and 6 are direct action (of the kind sometiems used by unions on picket lines, not peaceful perhaps, but not terrorsim) and 6+ are designed to intimidate and thus can be considered terrorsim. (ie no one would be scared of the first three, the next two are more annoying than provoking fear, and the last 5 would (or could) provoke fear or terror with an overlap on the verbal abuse). The BTP is #7 on the list so would be a form of terrorism under my definition. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 13:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let us ask ourselves the question of whether or not the labeling of the events surrounding the Boston Tea Party as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> would pass the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> test? Essentially the British Government (at that time) would have labeled the acts as "terrorism" but Americans would label the act as "patriotism". When an article is categorized it assumes the label associated with the category. The earlier comments that mentioned <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (to illustrate a point about terrorism) were correct. The labeling of this event (particularly where in any other encyclopedia such is not the case) as an act of terrorism reaks of historical revisionism to which Wikipedia has no business being a part of.

<dd>From my perspective, the answer is simple. "Terrorism" has become a <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogeyman.html" title="Bogeyman">bogeyman</a> and an excuse for repressive/authoritarian governments to resort to violence, so it's difficult to define.

<p>This might be just a rewording of Netscott's comment, but I think the category is inappropriate for this article chiefly because it's an anachronism. Terrorism was not a term or concept in use at the time, and we should avoid applying modern characterizations to historical events and conduct. Viewing the conduct in the abstract, without any context, can only result in misleading equivocation, especially since the importance of the conduct was its symbolic value or psychological impact. Contemporary perception of the conduct is therefore integral to understanding what it meant and how it should be characterized. Put another way, one cannot commit an act of terrorism in a world that has not yet conceived of terrorism. It would furthermore be OR for us to apply the term "terrorism" here when no other scholars or academic sources do. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 15:47, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I was asked to look at this discussion by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">Samwaltz</a> and I have a few comments. It seems like, if a change were to be made, it is important what definition one chooses. I think that, under current terrorist laws, the Boston Tea Party might technically qualify. However, if it were to happen, it would probably be called vandalism, not terrorism. I think that, with the possible exception of the <i>physical violence</i> clause, all definitions provided so far are broad enough to include the Boston Tea Party. Furthermore, a good point was raised that, out of the 900,000 hits for <i>"Boston Tea Party"</i>, 167,000 contain the word <i>terrorism</i>. Technically the Boston Tea Party probably is an example of terrorism. Harmless terrorism, but terrorism. However, it is not what I think, or what any editor thinks:</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves what wikipedia policy dictates in this case, because while the BTP might be terrorism, it is still revisionist to declare it that since it alters popularly held conceptions about the past. Here, I think it is useful to review the three content policies: NPOV, no original research, and verifiability. After reviewing these policies earlier today, I came to the following opinions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any information included on wikipedia must reflect a broader understanding of a significant portion of academia and/or the public (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>).</li>
<li>When there is disagreement, it is necessary to present all sides dispassionately, with adequate citations for further research by users (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>).</li>
<li>This means that, if we are to classify the BTP as a terrorist act,</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Proponents of doing so must show that their viewpoint is one shared by a significant number of experts in the field;</li>
<li>write a section for the article to concisely, and without additional theories, sum up the opinion of those academics and the response by other academics to them; and</li>
<li>provide adequate sourcing for every claim made.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If that can be done, I think a new category should be created: <i>Category:Acts that have been labeled terrorism</i> or something like that. --<b><a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjss_2fc9.html" title="User:Tjss">Tjss</a><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjss_dd61.html" title="User talk:Tjss">(Talk)</a></b> 16:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Personally, I don't feel the Boston Tea Party to be terrorism. The definition mentioned ("intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared") is too broad. Under that definition, those people who smashed Sony radios with a sledge hammer on TV back in the '80s to protest the trade imbalance with Japan or Jerry Rubin, who buried a number of GI Joe toys, or people who burn the US flag are then <i>de jure</i> terrorists even though they did not throw firebomb one. For were they not destroying property in order to change public opinion in a situation where a war has not been declared? And if memory serves, there was little intimidation on the part of the Sons of Liberty towards the owners of the ships, with Sam Adams even going so far as to make sure that a padlock they had broken was replaced. This was hardly John Brown going to Harper's Ferry or Guy Fawkes trying to blow up Parliament. On the other hand, Tjss's suggestion may be a good compromise. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 16:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC) <i>Edit in</i> I was also asked by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">User:Samwaltz</a> to comment. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 18:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I disagree that the Boston Tea Party was terrorism, because I disagree with a part of the definition of terrorism: <i>"<b>Terrorism</b> is the systematic use or threatened use of violence to intimidate a population or government and thereby effect political, religious, or ideological change."</i>. I disagree with <b>or government</b>. The point of terrorism is to influence or intimidate the <i>population</i>, in order to cause a government to act. The Boston Tea Party was an attack aimed at the government, not at the population at large, and therefore is not an act of terrorism, but rather of <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 17:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>The biggest problem with this issue is that it involves the application of a category, which appears as an unannotated, unelaborated statement of presumed fact. I doubt many of us would have a problem with a section titled "Modern perceptions of the Boston Tea Party" in which whether scholars believe it would be characterized as terrorism under modern definitions could be <b>discussed</b>, with sources cited.

<p>I was also asked to comment by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">User:Samwaltz</a>. I have never equated this as an act of terrorism. I thought of it as an act of defiance, like a protest. People who protest or who pull down banners or even those who commit vandalism are not terrorists. I think a category of protests or civil disturbance would be sufficient. The BTP participants weren't trying to kill anyone, were they? I don't know, not being an American and therefore not familiar with the details. However, if it happened today, there might be a police inquiry, but President Bush wouldn't put the people on a list of an 'axis of evil' or include them in his war on terror!! <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 18:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It does not seem to me that the Boston Tea Party should be caterogized as terrorism. When in doubt about things such as this, i.e. whether A should be considered an example of B, I turn to the OED. The relevant definition of "terrorism" there is "A policy intended to strike with terror those against whom it is adopted; the employment of methods of intimidation; the fact of terrorizing or condition of being terrorized". I have seen no evidence that it was meant to strike terror into the British. Though they did dress up as Mohawks, the WP article makes it sound as though they were very nice about it on the whole. Cleaning up after one's self does not strike terror into the heart of whoever one vandalized. I'm not sure that it intimidated the British; it certainly doesn't seem it to me, but I'd be willing to listen to arguments to that effect. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl.bunderson_9caa.html" title="User:Carl.bunderson">Carl.bunderson</a> 19:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find Netscott's and Postdlf's comments persuasive; I would think the British contemporaries would have categorized the BTP not as terrorism, but instead, a rebellious act. Despite the broad (and questionable) definition presently contained in Wikipedia, it seems that terrorism today is understood to mean an organized, deliberate, despicable attack upon random, innocent people with the intent to kill or maim, so as to shock and horrify a population. The perpetrator's stated purpose for the attack does not seem very important. The BTP does not fit this notion and most Americans generally accept it as having been a patriotic act. To categorize it with events such as 9/11 seems to invite the reader to consider whether terrorists are merely modern versions of the colonial American patriots. Quite absurd, and definitely not NPOV. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 21:13, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely, there are those who believe that the perpetrators of 9/11 are patriots. Is that opinion less valid than American patriotism? Personally, I oppose the existence of terrorism-related categories because I believe the term is an invective and it will never be used in an NPOV manner. However, the Boston Tea Party does meet some of the numerous proposed definitions for terrorism, so I'm not sure how we can make a fair distinction between it and other instances of terrorism. The category might as well stay.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 03:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Americans generally accept..." My understanding is that wikipedia isn't about what americans accept, it's about what any significant group accept. I'd guess that a significant group (several hundred million people?) think the 9/11 terrorists were patriots. Conversely, based on current laws of at least one US state, an american who breaks a padlock and frees animals which would otherwise be purchased for slaughter by rogue government employees, is a terrorist, subject to many years in prison, even if the government employees are found guilty of illegal purchases of the horses for slaughtering. Imo the core issue is the nature, especially evolutionary aspects, of cybernetic phenomena such as language and wikipedia. Thank you all for a such a wonderful resource, and for the fine public debates that surround its evolution. [a wikipedia friend, somewhat scared about her IP address being traced...]</dd>

<p>The situation is very simple: if reliable sources have called this incident a "terrorist incident", then we can call it that as well. We can't label subjects based on our own definitions, that is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and we are not a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a>. The more controversial the claim (I think this qualifies), the more reliable sources that need to be cited making the claim. Simply put, we can't call something a "terrorist incident" unless reliable sources do so for us. Otherwise, it is original research. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-08-23 06:29</small></p>

<p>I agree with the comments of Netscott and Postdlf regarding the anachronistic nature of the proposed categorization.

<p>Someone, maybe me when I have the time, needs to clean up this article, get the facts straight, discuss in depth what happened to lead up to the Tea Party. These are just some of the things I noticed:</p>
<p>The name, "boston tea party" needs to be adressed. From what I understand the "party" does not refer to an event, but the people involved, and only later it came to mean the actual act. More talk about the setting. A common misconception is that it occurred at night, when in fact it happened in broad daylight. Who attended it: I remember reading (I may be wrong) that the tea party was a mass gathering: there were as many as five thousand bystanders, who calmly watched as the tea was dumped overboard. Why did the people dress as Indians? I do not think it was to protect their identities. In my opinion, the indian dress was probably designed to send a message to the British (that the colonists could not be tamed or controlled, just like the Indians— a "free spirit" type of thing). Perhaps this should be mentioned.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Torus (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Torus_c7fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Torus">contribs</a>) 15:29, 18 November 2006.</small></p>

I noted the error in Wikipedia:Main Page/Errors, but I thought I'd bring it up here as well in hopes of getting it fixed more quickly. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECam_9b85.html" title="User:Cam">Cam</a> 16:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the final paragraph of Background, it is stated that "HMS Dartmouth arriving in late November 1765" Based on the BTP occurring on Dec 16, 1773, it seems the correct arrival year of the Dartmouth would be 1773 rather than 1765. 76.173.241.224 12:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)unboy</p>
