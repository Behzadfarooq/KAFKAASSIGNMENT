<p>"Headmaster" is the term Boston Latin School has used since 1635, and she has no intention of changing it. It doesn't matter if she is not a "master," she is still called the headmaster (which I suppose you could translate as "head of the masters," which she is.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.163.243.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.163.243.54_170d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.163.243.54">contribs</a>) 2006-07-15T11:23:02 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I'm not sure how noticeable this is, but Pres. Bush visited in 2000 to talk about/announce No Child Left behind.</p>
<p><br />
When Bush visited he addressed the current Headmaster as "Headmistress" and she was visibly put out by it. Her official title is Headmaster.</p>
<p>The difficulty with BLS is that homogeneous student bodies turn half the inmates into chronic underachievers. Where students share a single attribute--in this case, academic ability--the environmental press reinforces those who are sensitive to it negatively. One study, by a high school principal, says that a public high school student experiences 6,000 instances of negative self-esteem in a four-year high school career; BLS has more, and for some, over six years. This produces anxiety that impairs achievement, a characteristic that persists in any environment where only excellence will do. It turns out, says research, that all students learn more, including the gifted, when all levels of student ability learn together. Democracy turns out to be good learning theory. BLS was never based on research, but on a Seventeenth Century notion that the mind is an empty room waiting to be furnished. For example, there's no evidence that language study trains the mind any more successfully than Music or computer programming. The best thing that BLS could do for students is apply educational research to teaching. As things stand, BLS claims all who survive it. Learning should be a joy. Haec studia nolunt mentem. [James Sutton]</p>
<p>"It turns out, says research, that all students learn more, including the gifted, when all levels of student ability learn together. Democracy turns out to be good learning theory."</p>
<p>Not only is the first sentence in that statement blatantly false (to speak nothing of the absurd second sentence), I suspect one would be hard-pressed to provide reputable research which could provide a reasonable metric on how much "learning" takes place under various conditions. It is quite clear, however, that when gifted students are in an environment which must cater to a common denominator, they generally are not provided an opportunity to reach their full potential. As no context is provided, it is possible that the statement refers to an entire institution, and not to individual classes (such as advanced or accelerated classes in english or mathematics); however, a claim that the same principle applies to the stratification of institutions would not be spurious.</p>

<p>I think the NPOV approach to the question of whether BLS or Roxbury Latin gets the title is simply to acknowledge that there is some disagreement.</p>
<p>Also, there are a bit too many details here about Roxbury Latin. The fact that it moved to West Roxbury at some point hardly belongs in the BLS entry.</p>

<p>Exactly. We should acknowledge the unclarity. It is definitely not a certainty that Boston Latin is the oldest school.</p>

<dl>
<dd>NYC5, stop using Wikipedia for "boosterism" as you call it. Collegiate date is ambiguous BLS is not. There is not contention. If Collegiate wants to argue, they can do it on their own page. There is no ambiguity about the BLS date. No one challenges it. No one disputes it. But there is ambiguity about the Collegiate date. This discussion should stay on Collegiate's page. When Collegiate establishes, without doubt it's founding date, you can come and change the wording on the BLS page, until then, the facts, and multiple sources, support that BLS is the oldest school. Collegiate has a few murky sources and a disputed founding date. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHashbrowns_4e7d.html" title="User:Hashbrowns">Hashbrowns</a> 02:40, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not any one school's page -- this is an encyclopedia. I do not think that either Collegiate or Boston Latin has a clear-cut claim; thus, we should make sure both pages reflect the ambiguity.</p>
<dl>
<dd>False, Boston Latin has a clear-cut claim to be the oldest school for more than 300 years. IN 1985, the Collegiate school digged up an obscure reference to some class held by a Dutch minister and claimed some conneciton with teh school that stands today. Until the reference is verified and the link is made, the claim has not changed for Latin. Collegiate officials are not eager to look fruther into the issue because the ambiguity allows them to make claims like this and heighten their profile by comparing themselves with Boston Latin. In fact, until Collegiate has less murky information, the only clear-cut facts availible and researched make Boston Latin the oldest, and wikipedia will reflect that until more evidence supports Colleigate's claims. Do not revert BLS until you can rectify the ambiguity of Colligiate's founding or make that school's history less opaque. You can start by actually reading the actual history availible instead of making guesses. Your statements, unsupported by actual fact, suggest that you do not have aaccess to the data. The New York Times article is a good place to start. If you don't have access to the text, I can provide you with it. Further claims can be made on Colligiate's page, there is no reason for you to do it here. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHashbrowns_4e7d.html" title="User:Hashbrowns">Hashbrowns</a> 22:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the alumni association's definition allows that any who attended for more than 2 years are "alumni," if not graduates. That's been consistent throughout our history. Ben Franklin and Arthur Fiedler are just two of the many who didn't actually graduate. A full 4 or 6-year course of study wasn't always practical--just ask the many living alumni who left early to serve our country during wars or to support their family. Even today, if a former student wishes to remain part of the community, we're happy to oblige. <span style="font-size: 70%"><i>(This comment added by Lpfblsa · 2006-08-02T12:57:17)</i></span></p>

<p>I graduated from Boston Latin in 1997. At the time, 5 years of Latin were required from those entering in seventh grade, and four years from those who entered in the ninth. Therefore, I had the option not to take Latin my senior year, as I entered in the seventh, but all of my friends who joined as freshman had no choice.</p>
