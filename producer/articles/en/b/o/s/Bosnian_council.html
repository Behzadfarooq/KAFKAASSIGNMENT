<p>The period of Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina can be divided into fallowing eras:</p>
<ol>
<li>Occupational period (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>. – <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>.)
<ol>
<li>Period of martial governance (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>. – <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>.)</li>
<li>Period of civil governance (<a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Annexational crisis (<a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. – <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.)</li>
<li>Post-annexation period (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>. – <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>.)</li>

</ol>
<p>Post-annexation period was highly important since, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a> 1910 the constitutionality was declared. It was regulated by six main laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Zemaljski statut</i> (the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>)</li>
<li><i>Izborni red</i> (Elections policy)</li>
<li><i>Saborski poslovni red</i> (Rules of council's procedures)</li>
<li><i>Zakon o društvima u BiH</i> (Laws on political parties)</li>
<li><i>Zakon sakupljanja u BiH</i> (Rules on principles of assembly)</li>
<li><i>Zakon o kotraski vijećima</i> (Laws on regulating the work of region councils)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of all the restrains on Bosnian <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomy.html" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a>, the Constitution and its laws introduced three new institutions into political sphere of this country:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bosanski sabor</i> (Bosnian council)</li>
<li><i>Zemaljski savjet</i> (National counsel)</li>
<li><i>Kotarsko vijeće</i> (region council)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, it was necessary to guarantee the basic <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> and to regulate public assembly since these rights are the foundations of parliamentary life.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_council.html" title="Edit section: The Election survey">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Election survey</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, after the settling of Annexational crisis the new government started the preparation for establishment of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>. To pacify the public of Bosnia, on 8. February 1909 the new <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> called the election survey that was opened by baron Benko. He was presenting the main principles of the future constitution, among which the Bosnian Coucil, its authority and its members.</p>
<p>The first principle of the Bosnian Council was in the letter of <a href="../../../t/z/a/Tzar.html" title="Tzar">tzar</a>, which was the part of annexation agreement and which described the ways of constituting the future council. The constitution was supposed to guarantee the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_human_rights.html" title="Basic human rights">basic human rights</a>, and thus its authority did not include the common affairs of Austro-Hungaria, such as: diplomatic, martial, monopolistic, and tzar's missions. This put the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in subordinate relation to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. However, the authority of the Council did include all judicial and executive power in the country itself. The legislative power belonged to the tzar who was the only one to approve new laws.</p>
<p>Dr. Nikola Stojanović, the member of Bosnian party <a href="../../../s/n/o/SNO_b274.html" title="SNO">SNO</a>, spoke after baron Benko. He said that he and his fellows cannot be the part of the survey since they were invited as individuals, not as representatives of their political party, which baron Benko justified by saying that SNO are not formally recognized by the new government, the claim that dr. Stojanović rejected. What the members of SNO wanted was the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomy.html" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a> of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they rejected the new constitutional reforms. Since their requests remained unfulfilled, all the party members restrained from the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>. The speech of dr. Stojanović was printed in <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> on his own request to avoid possible accusations that such requests never existed.</p>
<p>The members of MNO: Firdus, Karabeg, and Miralem, firmly rejected participation in the survey and they did not participate the first meeting on constitutional survey either. Thus members of all parties but MNO, SNO, and Social-democratic party of B&amp;H, participated in the constitutional survey. The representatives of Bosnian Croats were HNZ, Štadler clerk party, and MNS, and the representatives of Bosnian Serbs were SNSS, and its leader dr. Lazar Dimitrijević. The survey showed unified opinion of all its members, especially on economical growth of native population. All the members criticized the regulations on tariffs and railroads, and they requested that Bosnian Council has the authority over customs, indirect taxes and monopoly. On all their reasonable and argumental requests the answer of baron Benko was pointing out the right to tell their wishes to higher authorities.</p>
<p><a name="Writing_the_Constitution" id="Writing_the_Constitution"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_council.html" title="Edit section: Writing the Constitution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Writing the Constitution</span></h3>
<p>When the survey ended, starting with 4 May <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>. MNO published few pamphlets called "Our Constitutional Regime" where they stated the attitude of their party on the new Constitution. They wanted the meeting of all people representatives, members of all political parties in order to discuss new Constitution. The main condition for this meeting posed by MSN was allowing the public elections, agreements and political activism. These two laws should be brought before the Constitution itself since it would be absurd to elect the representatives of the people if the people had no right to form political party due to the lack of freedom to gather and organize meetings and assemblies. Their main concern was foundation of full parlament and legal <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomy.html" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a> of Bosnia and Herzegovina. MNO declared their will to keep the coordination with Serbs since they also demanded governing the country over National council (parlament) that would consist of 31 Orthodox members, 24 Muslim members and 16 Catholic members; and not over the Zagreb Council that would have 116 Catholic members, 69 Orthodox members and 24 Muslim members. Due to the liberalism of pamphlets the editorial of Musvata that publish them were punished with 1 500 kruna. But after declaring the annexation by Gligorije Jeftanović and thus stopping the fight for autonomy, the Bosnia-Serbian alliance quickly fell apart.</p>
<p>When the annexation were declared, and MNO moved to opposition, MNS saw the oppertunaty to impose themselves as political representative of Bosniaks people. They were highly interested in the promised Constitution. Thus they suggested annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia, which they saw as opportunity to solve their Constitutional problems. Moreover, they asked for the right of language of home Bosnian people from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonization.html" title="Colonization">colonizing</a> powers in the Monarchy, especially from <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a>.</p>
<p>The representatives of MNS gave their proposal on the Constitution to baron Benko on the first survey meeting. This proposal included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting Bosniaks from forceful converting to Catholicism</li>
<li>Protecting the private properties and keeping the agrarian relations that were the law from <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a>.</li>
<li>Having Bosnia and Herzegovina as one unity</li>
<li>Protecting the Muslim matrimonial, familial and inheritance rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of making the Constitution was very slow. Only after year and a half of the work when the Constitution was almost ready MNO declared the annexation and loyalty to the governing <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a>. But they requested the increase in number of Muslim representatives in the Council, following the same principle as Croats and Serbs. They also wanted better position in choosing process since they had no such possibility. And the last demand was the increase in number of intellectuals in citizens members. These requests were denied.</p>
<p>The constitution and laws following it were approbated by the tzar on 17 November <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>. The ceremony was held and attended by all members of government, higher government representatives, religious representatives, and many other notable people. The acclamation was read by Marjan Varešanin who briefly announced the new changes in the county and read the tzar's decree on establishing the new Constitution.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_council.html" title="Edit section: The Structure of Bosnian Council">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Structure of Bosnian Council</span></h2>
<p>Bosnian Council started its work on 20. February <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>. It consisted of members belonging to different social, confessional, and region groups. Bosnian Council, unlike other representative institutions in the Monarchy, did not have established domestic tradition. According to Council's order the members belonged to three groups differing by ethnicity and religion. Within these confessional groups there were another grouping according to social situation of members:</p>
<ol>
<li>Group of aristocrats and intellectuals</li>
<li>Towns group</li>
<li>Village county group</li>
</ol>
<p>National Government suggested electing one delegate on 25.000 citizens. <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>. population census showed 1.568.092 citizens of whom 548.632 were <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>, 673.246 <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox.html" title="Orthodox">Orthodox</a> and 334.142 <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholics</a>. According to these data the Council had 72 delegates, 16 of whom were Catholics, 24 Muslims, 31 Orthodox and only 1 Judaist. All male Bosnians and Herzegovinians who were over 24 and lived in Bosnia over one year had the active right to vote. Of women, the active right to vote had only those who had land tax on which was 140 krunas. Passive right to vote had all males who were older than 30 and enjoyed all citizen rights.</p>
<p>In reality the situation was different. It was highly dependent on group and confession, every group favored one confession, but approximately confessions of all voters were balanced: one Orthodox delegate was on 33.714 citizens, Muslim's on 33.335 citizens, and Catholic's on 33.373 citizens. This was established to keep the balance between the three ethnic and confessional groups, which was one of main principles of Austro-Hungarian government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thus the tzar was obligated to watch the president's and vice-president' position and that the three confession groups circulated.</p>
<p>Delegate’s mandate lasted for 5 years, and the voters did not have the right of repeal. The president and vice-president were chosen by the tzar who tried to balance their confessional choice in circular order. Besides the elected members the following members were always introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muslims - <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reis.html" title="Reis">Reis</a>, the principal of Muslim's granted lands, Muslim's regional leader from Mostar and the regional leader who was elected the first.</li>
<li>Orthodox - four <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">archbishops</a> and the president of Orthodox community.</li>
<li>Catholics - archbishop and two province members of Franjevci order of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</li>
<li>Jewess - <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardic</a> <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> of higher order</li>
<li>The president of Supreme Court, the president of Sarajevo attorney chamber, the mayor of nation capital Sarajevo, and the president of Sarajevo trading chamber.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure was to ensure the conservative Council. Moreover, the Constitutional article 35 stated that the Council cannot speak with other representatives or make any sort of announcements; the Council's meeting cannot have any outsider delegates, and the Council itself can send delegates to the tzar only after requesting and getting the approval.</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the unique region with unique position in the Monarchy, thus it represented the unique administrative unit - <i>corpus separatum</i>. This legal subjectivity was partly reflected by the Bosnian Council. But the direct participation on the level with Austria and Hungary was never allowed. National Council was the institution with aim to ensure better legal and political position of Bosnia within the Monarchy. But regardless of all restrictions, Bosnian Council was the stage of entire civilian and political life of this country.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_council.html" title="Edit section: First Council Elections">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Council Elections</span></h2>
<p>National government called the first council elections on 18-28 May <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>. MNO and MSS negotiated of creating one unity and sharing the possible mandates. MNO suggested giving 6 mandates to MSS, which they rejected. After the elections, all 31 Orthodox mandates got one party, SNO, and all 24 Muslim mandates were given to MNO. 14 out of 16 Catholic places were given to HNZ, and the other 4 to HKZ led by archbishop Josip Štandler.</p>
<p>Great number of voters took part. In village regions 88.205 out of 105.734 Muslim voters participated, i.e. 83%, 85% of Serb voters participated and only 61% of Croats. No places were given to MSS and democrats who suggested <a href="../../../o/s/m/Osman_%C4%90iki%C4%87_5769.html" title="Osman Đikić">Osman Đikić</a> as their candidate. But the MNO party was so powerful that people refused listening to Đikić’s Smail-aga Ćemalović’s speeches.</p>
<p>In the beginning the Council worked on agreement, but almost all four meetings they had, included Serbian and Croatian arguments on their right over Bosnia and Herzegovina, which started even with the first proposal for the laws of raising post funds. This together with the assassination of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Ferdinand_8b2b.html" title="Franz Ferdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a> led to abolishment of Bosnian Council. Meanwhile, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> started.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_council.html" title="Edit section: Bosnia and Herzegovina after the abolishment of Council">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bosnia and Herzegovina after the abolishment of Council</span></h2>
<p>Until the World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the separate governing body within the structure of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. It had special legal system, special status of their citizens that were not treated neither as Austrians nor as Hungarians. Such political subjectivity was mainly reflected through Bosnian Council. But even after the Bosnian Council was abolished, the country still had special legal and political status that was often discussed among the highest representatives of the Monarchy.</p>
<p>The Bosnia nation superior Stjepan Sarkotić suggested forming administrative senate instead of Bosnian Council that would function as a sort of representative body. The suggestion was rejected with an explanation that Bosnian Council was not abolished and that it will be brought to function again as soon as the circumstances are changed.</p>
<p>The legal status of Bosnia was seriously considered with an effort to prevent possible destruction of Austro-Hungary and to obstruct the solution of <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav.html" title="Yugoslav">Yugoslav</a> question. Austria insisted annexing the Bosnia to Austria, while Hungary insisted on annexing it to Hungary. Moreover, the various plans of dividing Bosnia among the two countries existed. Hungary would get regions of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banja_Luka_fddc.html" title="Banja Luka">Banja Luka</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/h/Biha%C4%87.html" title="Bihać">Bihać</a>, while Austria would get the others.</p>
<p>The president of Hungarian government, count <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istv%C3%A1n_Tisza_5d1f.html" title="István Tisza">István Tisza</a> thaught that political balance in the Monarchy could only be achieved by annexing Bosnia to Hungary, since the Poland was already annexed to Austria. This failed when the Yugoslav orientated politicians of Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly Serbs and Croats, on 20 September 1918 sent the request to allow Bosnian people to choose their own status. Meanwhile the process of Yugoslav question was highly active with goal to form one joint country, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_SHS_bd05.html" title="Kingdom of SHS">Kingdom of SHS</a>.</p>
