<p>Bosniak, I just added this to the Srebrenica discussion page.</p>
<p>Based on the information available in 2001 the ICTY Trial Chamber stated it "is satisfied that, in July 1995, following the take-over of Srebrenica,Bosnian Serb forces executed several thousand Bosnian Muslim men. The total number is likely to be within the range of 7,000 -8,000 men."</p>
<p>Based on data available now in 2006, it is clear that the 7,000 estimate is too low.</p>
<p>The ICMP has a very strict accounting for Srebrenica victims and only accepts family testimony backed up with DNA samples. The ICMP list of Srebrenica victims is currently at 7,789. <a href="http://www.ic-mp.org/home.php?act=news&amp;n_id=175" class="external free" title="http://www.ic-mp.org/home.php?act=news&amp;n_id=175" rel="nofollow">http://www.ic-mp.org/home.php?act=news&amp;n_id=175</a> The Federal Commission of Missing Persons in 2006 is now over 8000. Their method is also strict requiring at least two independent confirmations. In addition to the approximately 8,300 confirmed by the commission, there are several hundred more under review. I have put in a request with a Harvard researcher to give the latest official numbers with primary source material. I hope to have that soon.</p>
<p>I believe the data now available in 2006 collected by internationally accredited institutions will substantiate that the introduction ought to say "approximately 8,000 killed" not the year 2001 estimate of "7,000 to 8,000". I want to thank Osli for inspiring this additional research and given his professed commitment to a rational approach to writing this article, I rest assured that he too will agree to the "approximately 8,000 killed" in the introduction once all the documentation has been presented. Hmmmm... well on second thought he'll probably go running to Seselj to get the latest "controversy" and do everything he can to sabotage putting a reasonable estimate based on ICMP research in the introduction, but so it goes.

<p>Bosniak , it is clear to me that Osli wants to create controversy or delete items or in one way or another distract from the basic facts of what happened in Srebrenica. I believe that by reasoning with him, I can expose the fact that many of his deletions are unjustified and are in fact meant to destroy the veracity of the article. If I can show that he repeatedly deletes well established and relavant facts, then it will become increasingly obvious to administrators that he is at times engaging in vandalism. Currently, I am focusing on the intro. I know that some of my time is wasted dealing with Osli who I hardly believe is a Swede and who I do not accept as genuinely concerned about anything other than promoting "Defend Milosevic! Defend Serbia" slants, but from time to time, I learn more while researching his specious claims which adds to my knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and current ultra-nationalist tactics for covering up or distracting from what happened; and perhaps most relevant of all, I injured my back rather significantly recently and have time to burn. Hence my appearance here several days ago and my abundant time available to watch and thwart Osli's oscillations from overt vandalism to re-inventing himself as a reasonable editor. Its at times both pathetic and amusing. Fairview360 20:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bosniak, Live Forever, Bosoni, Emir Arven, HanzoHattori, Dado, Haris M:</p>
<p>I would like to protect the Srebrenica massacre introduction from any further vandalism by Osli. He repeatedly deletes sentences from the intro that are accurate, true, relevant, and well referenced.</p>
<p>If we can all agree on the text of the intro, then it will become entirely clear to administrators that Osli is a vandal.</p>
<p>Please look at the intro as it stands now. It would be great if we could all leave it as it is now or quickly come to an introduction that we all can agree to. Currently, it explains in stark terms what happened. That is why Osli wants to delete the sentences. Make the truth less clear in the beginning, so that he can then throw in his ‚ÄúDefend Milosevic! Defend Serbia!‚Äù propaganda and potentially confuse some of the readers.</p>
<p>Please all take a look at the intro. Let‚Äôs all come to an agreed upon intro and let it stand. Then if Osli continues to delete sentences from the intro it will clearly be vandalism and if he continues, perhaps he can be banned. Then we can concentrate on the article and let our own differences of opinion be a source for constructive conversation and continuing improvement of the article.</p>

<p>Bosniak, I have seen the mass graves, the exhumations. I have friends who are survivors. I myself had a rough time trying to maintain rationality having seen the horror perpetrated by cold-hearted politicians, by willing executioners overtaken by hate and malice, and by those who were told by their commanders either kill or be killed. But Bosniak, you have to keep your cool. It does feel like what you really want to do is go outside and scream at the top of your lungs "The Serbs are murderers!". <i>That statement in and of itself is not accurate.</i> Some Serbs fought against the ultranationalist Serbs. There are Serbs who lost their lives trying to defend multi-ethnic democracy both in Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some Serbs did everything they could to confront the Greater Serbia project. If some of the Serbs and some of the Croats had not joined the Bosnian Army defending a multi-ethic democratic Bosnia, there would be no Bosniaks left in Bosnia. There are moderate reasonable Serbs who are nationalists who would agree to move forward in a multi-ethnic democratic system while all crimes are looked at openly. There are Serbs today who are not at all nationalist who want nothing less than to have their nation look honestly at what they did. And if we are going to take a deeper look at what generates these conflicts, we need to look at corruption and how it eats away at civil society and allows cold-hearted power-grabbing people to manipulate Balkan history and foster genocidal conflict. And without allowing the "all sides equal" obfuscation, we must look at everything everyone did both good and bad.</p>
<p>This is going to take generations, but we must find common ground with reasonable people so that the killing does not happen again.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to put his energy into rehabilitating Lewis MacKenzie is obviously a problem, but even Osli can help improve the article. I'm sorry but he is correct that using your blog as a source is not OK. We need to put in the time finding primary source material.</p>
<p>In the free exchange of ideas put forth by honest people, the truth will emerge.</p>
<p>Bosniak, stick with it. Keep your cool. Do not quit. Fairview360 16:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is becoming clearer to me that Osli73 is sneaky, but still his challenges are indicative of others like him and good practice for refuting revisionist and underhanded tactics. Fairview360 19:54, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Osli may need to be tolerated to a certain extent, but ever since he tried to erase the names of those killed or missing and sneak it by as a minor edit, I would prefer that he was banned. That maneuver shows his true colors. Fairview360 14:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for returning the information in Srebrenica article. Unfortunately I don't have time to frequently proof read the entire article. I generally rely on users who are familiar with the subject to keep tabs on this article so that I don't have to be in charge of reading it every day. Also it would be of great help when you make additions to this article to carefully state the source simply to avoid further attacks on the article that waste time for all of us. What some may consider controversial statements such as the statement in your last addition, while it may be completely true, when left unsourced it weakens the credibility of the article and makes it prone to attacks. It does not mean the statement does not belong there but we just need to know where it came from and the fact supporting it. For example this paragraph</p>
<p>"Seven more have been recently put on trial. One person, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Jorgic_48b0.html" title="Nikola Jorgic">Nikola Jorgic</a> was convicted of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Genocide_8469.html" title="Bosnian Genocide">Bosnian Genocide</a>."</p>

In fact, now that I look at it this statement better fits article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_genocide.html" title="Bosnian genocide">Bosnian genocide</a> than <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> since activity of Nikola Jorgic pertains to other regions in BiH.

Neko je vec spomenuo da bi ovaj clanak trebao da lici na clanak, a ne na ustogljenu sudsku presudu, radi toga se radi parafraziranje dijelova presude, a ne identicno kopiranje, zbog cega cijeli clanak moze da propadne. Zamolio bih te da ne vracas vise na Fairview360-ovu, samo ce nam donijeti belaj. Jesil ti svjestan koliko je truda trebalo da se napravi clanak bez POV taga?! Ovaj clanak je zapocet prije godinu dana, i sada zbog nekih preemotivnih postupaka pojedinaca, a koji nista bitno ne mijenjaju treba da propadne?

<p>That is none of your business. Unless you stop poisoning Srebrenica massacre article with moral relativism and already discredited Serbian sources, me and you cannot talk. When you stop your advertisements of discredited Serbian opinions, I will find time to speak to you again. Remember: Srebrenica article is not about Serbs or Serbian claims/politics - it's about 8,000+ victims of Genocide that was committed by Serb forces. Can you comprehed this statement?

<p>Hi Live Forever, yes you did some changes on one part of the article, but completely ignored changes that Osli73 did. You need to keep changing his changes to keep that article on a level of high quality that was before. If you do changes, revert to my last version and do changes from there, and then when I start editing the article, I will do them from your version. Please do it this way and we will succeed in keeping the article on a level of encyclopedia quality.

<p>Another thing:</p>
<p>Yes, Osli73 is vandalizing Srebrenica article. If you look at the history of his contributions, you will notice that he is obsessed with Srebrenica Massacre article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Osli73" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Osli73" rel="nofollow">Osli73 Contributions</a>. By entering into discussion with him, you are violating basic principle of common sense - to stay away from unreasonable individuals. He takes a great pride in destroying the article, although he is not succeeding. Hopefully, wikipedia administrators will notice his behaviour and either suspend him, or ban him completely. His only purpose is to vandalize Srebrenica Massacre article, he has no other purpose here @ wikipedia. You should not try to reason with him, you are just wasting your time my friend. There will always be people who will vandalize wikipedia, and that's sad (but true). <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 05:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, I'm sure we can deal with the conflict in a civilized manner. But you first have to face that the article is not neutral because it doesn't tell all sides of the story. All I want is the neutrality tag in the article, thats all.

<b>Bosniak's reply to Boris</b> Hi Boris, of course we can deal in civilized matter. Why do you think that the article is not neutral? Can you at least discuss this in Srebrenica Massacre's discussion page? If you want your edits to stay longer, you need to discuss it before you make any changes. People are very sensitive to any changes to that article. Even when I make a change, they are sensitive to it. Why do you think that the article does not tell all sides of the story? Are you trying to tell that Naser Oric attacked Serb villages and Serbs had to defend themselves from Bosniaks who were under siege? You guys used same argument in the past with Sarajevo, basicly the story goes that you had to defend yourself from Bosniak people in Sarajevo who were under siege. You can try these arguments in discussion page, but it's pointless and offensive to use such arguments as a defence. However, you are welcome to try. Simply go to discussion page, tell people reasons of your edits and sources and then we will all compromise. It's simple as that. No need for personal attacks as we can all deal in civilized matter. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 03:53, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing - I already donated my translation to your page, and I copied your translations to my page. I think there is a chance that both of us get along well, because you recognized t hat over 8,000 people were killed in Srebrenica @ Srebrenica Massacre discussion page. That's all I care about. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 03:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please don't call me nationalist. Lets start from there. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Serb</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 03:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Secondly, I do admit that 8,000 people were killed, I do not deny it. I'd like at least this sentence in the article "Some people (mainly Serbs) consider the massacre an act of defense against Naser Oric and his troops that massacred Serb villages of Kravica and others" If that was there, or some variation of the sentence, that would make me happy. Thats all. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Serb</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 04:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Bosniak's reply to Boris</b> - If you pay more attention to Srebrenica massacre discussion page, you will see that I do not sympathize Naser Oric, see my comment [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Naser_Oric_is_not_Bosniak_hero" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Naser_Oric_is_not_Bosniak_hero" rel="nofollow">Naser Oric is not a Bosniak hero</a>. At Srebrenica massacre discussion page you recognized that genocide happened. At this point, there is no need for further confrontation as you are obviously not denying finall judgements and findings of International Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>If you want Serb side of the story, why not post this statement: "Most Serbs consider the massacre an act of revenge against Naser Oric and his troops who committed individual war crimes during raids into Serb villages."</p>
<p>The reason these raids cannot be called massacres is the following: Serbs blame Oric and his forces for hundreds of deaths in Kravice during Orthodox Christmas in January 1993. Republika Srpska primary sources state that in Kravica 35 soldiers and 11 civilians died. If we are going to call slaughter of 11 civilians a massacre, then we could apply that term to mostly all killings in Bosnia. What I can agree with you is that individual actions of Oric's troops in Kravica were a war crime and I absolutely condemn these killings. However, they cannot be used for justification of genocide, and I don't believe you are trying to use them as such. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 04:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Listen, I don't believe that Srebrenica was an act of genocide, and of course, nothing you say is going to change my mind. I do NOT justify the killings and think that Ratko Mladic deserves the DEATH penalty for what he did. Neither do I think that Naser Oric's mistakes were justification for the killing of refugees who had no where else to go and most likely had nothing to do with the crimes that Oric's troops comitted. So, I thank you for adding the sentence, and agree to the removal of the POV tag. I would also like to draw your attention to one more thing - the photo on your userpage in not from Commons, therefore you're not allowed to use it. I suggest you transfer it to Commons, or remove it before they protect your user page like they did mine. I would also like to add that I do think you're obsessed with the massacre, and should get out more. I do my fair share of obsessing about what happened, but you're going too far.

<p>Bosniak is very sensitive to the issue of genocide denial, understandably, and doesn't always express himself in tempered tones. But Blnguyen it seems to me that you've simply responded to the tone of his language rather than the substantive justification for his action.</p>
<p>The ICTY, a member of the United Nations family of organisations and the legal authority in the field, has ruled in the Krstic case that the Srebrenica massacre could be termed genocide in accordance with the provisions of the Genocide Convention. No other international forum has overthrown that ruling. The ICTY is currently hearing cases in which charges of genocide are involved. I think it is fair to assume that the defence will present all current arguments challenging the categorisation of the Srebrenica massacre as genocide to the Court. The Court will then rule as to whether its previous opinion should be overthrown. There is no room for any personal expression of doubt in this article. I might dispute the legitimacy of Slobodan Milosevic's assumption of the presidency of Yugoslavia or equally George W. Bush's election as President of the United States but I cannot change the content of an entry to indicate that they were not President of their respective nations.</p>
<p>Bosniak was right to insist that denials of genocide will be edited out of this article. There is no scope to allow any further denial of genocide unless and until the ICTY's ruling is overthrown. Even though I don't always agree with the way Bosniak expresses his views, in this case he is absolutely correct. Personally I find it a moral outrage that genocide at Srebrenica is denied but for the purposes of this article we're trying to pretend that moral outrage doesn't exist and keep to the facts. Genocide at Srebrenica is a fact established in international law. I ask the moderators of this article to accept that.<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 10:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

That counts as your vote, inasmuch as there are "votes" in an AfD. There was another comment (in fact dated earlier, I see now - 21:49, 23 November 2006) which began with the bolded phrase <b>DO NOT DELETE</b> which you'd also left. That makes two votes. Then, at 06:51, 26 November 2006 you posted a <i>third</i> vote headed <b>Don't delete</b> and in fact repeated the exact same information as you had previously done ("In the beginning, Serbophobia returned only 2 matches at Google..."). All I was doing was tidying things up so that only one of your three votes was in fact there and so that one of your two duplicate comments was there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:16, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And in terms of the comments themselves, you did not "give more detailed explanation second time". What you gave was the exact same opinion the second time. The only difference was that the second time was entirely in boldface. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:21, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Bosniak.. someone deleted your comment on my talk page before I even saw it! However wikipedia still told me there was a change obviously.. Hm, I wasn't aware that this conflict was going on that you mention, although I agree that a lot of people (especially from the Balkans!) use wikipedia to advance their narrow nationalistic understanding of history. In a way you can't blame people because everyone is raised in a certain society that puts a spin on history. But when you're actively suppressing unpleasant facts, it certainly crosses the line. Anyways I don't know if I would consider either Bosniakophobia or Serbophobia proper words.. It's just an awkward way of creating a word (-phobia) and personally I would rather the plainer way of saying it "anti-Bosniak sentiment" or some other way. Anyways let me know if I can help you sometime. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Carkner_13c4.html" title="User:Dan Carkner">Dan Carkner</a> 13:50, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sure many articles relating to former Yugoslavia and its people have some strong Serb Pov. The Serb users are very active on Wiki.</p>
<p>You're right articles with so called lies get copied from Wiki onto other websites and before you know it the lie has spread. I think these Users are aware of this wide spread power and that's why they keep making edits or as many edits as possibe to articles ...pushing propaganda. Very Sad&gt; Some Serb Users have made over 300,000 edits. This is alarming to say the least. Who can patrol what has been edited???</p>
<p><br />
Not much you can do mate, just keep pluging away and keep fighting them the right way. First discuss and see why they keep changing facts with no proof. In most case you will find they sight Serbian propaganda books etc...</p>
<p><br />
Eg Some users keep changing Rudjer Boscovich from Croat to Serb. They keep doing it when it is wellknown the guy was Croat...still doesn't stop someone from editing the article into what they like to believe. In saying that most Serb users are fine and aware of this problem...+ not all sides are innocent...but yes the Serb users are a fair bit more active. Keep up the fight. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagoda_1_885e.html" title="User:Jagoda 1">Jagoda 1</a> 02:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is interesting how Serbs promoted invented word "Serbophobia" on the internet. First they introduced the word to wikipedia, and then thousands of other scrapper sites copied content from wikipedia, and now Google yields thousands of matches for this invented word. Of course, while Bosniaks wanted to do the same, and create an article Bosniakophobia, Serbs quickly jumped and voted "NO!". And of course, attempts to create Bosniakophobia article failed thanks to Serbian activism on wikipedia! They don't use wikipedia for educational, but for their nationalistic/politic purposes. It is sickening to see Serbian propaganda and lies poisoning Wikipedia. What we Bosniaks need to do is focus more on <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a> article which is under attack by pro-Serbian vandals and revisionists/deniers on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am working on expanding articles about Yugoslavia in the Hebrew wiki.</p>
<p>Currently, the main source for information is the English wiki.</p>
<p>Do you think the articles about Yugoslavia in English wiki are reliable and balanced? Are there disputed parts of the articles that better not be translated? I rather not to say anything about a sensitive issue then writing incorrect claims. (I'll start with the article "Yugoslavia" and the articles about Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia).</p>

<p>Hi my Jewish friend. No you can't trust "Yugoslavia" related articles, they are mostly run by Serb propagandists. Let me get in touch with you, so I can help you with it on Hebrew wikipedia. I would like to point some documentation to your attention regarding holocaust of Bosniaks and Jews in Jasenovac, from Bosnian documented sources. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 21:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sick of people who are pretending to be anti-nationalist while being greater nationalist then those who say it uncovered and loud.</p>
<p>People who were killed in Jasenovac were of Serbian (most of them), Jewish, Muslim (Bosniak), <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma</a> nationality and other nationalities, not just Jewish and Bosniaks.</p>
<p>I would advice our Jewish friend that, if he thinks that he can't rely on wikipedia's data, then should find some Hebrew book about Yugoslav history! --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevanb_6b00.html" title="User:Stevanb"><font style="background:blue" face="Showcard Gothic" color="yellow"><b>S T E V A N</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevanb_91bf.html" title="User talk:Stevanb"><font color="blue"><b>(talk)</b></font></a></sup> 00:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

And I do agree that Jasenovac victims came from all backgrounds. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 06:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bosniak, I'm glad you are admitting that Bosniaks are Serbs, because only Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats died in Jasenovac. Bosniaks are merely weak Serbs who would have rather converted to Islam then to stay who they were in defiance of the Turks.

<p>Dobro te je vise Bosniak.

<p>I'm not sure whether the rape accusations deserve to be mentioned, but now that an investigation has apparently be opened by the Bosnian prosecuting office, you may have a case. I also dislike contributors who hide behind an IP address so I reverted to your version, which does notice the accusations. However, I did keep the spelling corrections that you erased with your blind reverts. I also changed your text, that MacKenzie is "<b>accused</b> of raping of Bosniak women in camp Sonja by a Bosnian <b>court</b>" by "is <b>under investigation</b> by a Bosnian <b>prosecutor</b> following rape accusations" (emphasis added); I concluded that your version is incorrect after reading the statement by the Congress of North American Bosniaks.</p>

<p>I have discussed my changes thousands of times. Psychonaut is the one deleting important paragraphs of the article and not discussing them - you should block him temporarily. He is here on a mission (there were several Bosniak users blocked as a result of his activism and complaints). You should block user Psychonaut immediately. He has a bad faith. And you also reverted article to the worst form possible, to the "Hadzija" user revert. And he doesn't even accept genocide, the guy is Serbian, we have had problems with him in the past. You should definitely block Psychonaut - based on his activist-complaints agains Bosniaks, and his open pro-Serb stance - he is biased, in bad faith, one-sided, and he deserves to be blocked. He has been editing my edits tonight repeatedly, and you refused to block him. Are you neutral? I don't think so. If you are, then act and block him. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 08:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Psychonaut, please, please, please, please don't use word "Sorry" and don't portray yourself as a nice guy who wants to make things right. You have showed your face in the past, you have showed it tonight, you are in bad faith and you are on a mission - same things you accused me of. Your childish behavior and constant toddler like complaining and a mission and bad faith against Bosniak editors (you named several of them in your latest complaint) is just terrible. You had been blocked for vandalism in the past, and if there is any justice and fairness on this wikipedia, you ought to be blocked again. I have more respect for person I disagree with the most, which is user Hadzija, than I will ever have for you. At least, Hadzija does not go and does not complain about every single thing to administrator notice board. It's because Bosniaks and Serbians share one important value - we hate complaining. We hate going and talking behind people's back. Your behavior is just despicable, oh my god, I can't believe that people like you exist in this world. You accuse me of inventing false word "Bosniakophobia", when you know well that "Bosniakophobia" is as false and as invented as "Serpophobia". If you go to Bosnian wikipedia, you will see that Bosniakophobia has been there for a long time, which speaks about the fact that people use it. But the fact is, I don't care about either Bosniakophobia or Serpophobia, both words are nonsense as Bosniaks and Serbs are numerically "small" people and not that significant for explanation of "phobia". Again, that's another story, not a significant one. What's significant is to preserve facts about Srebrenica Genocide. Serbian and leftist-apologist (socialist) websites have been involved in defence of General MacKenzie, and the most sources that jump into MacKenzie's defence come from those revisionist sources. I have seen some edits that you made on a topic of socialism, so it seems you are interested in those sources, so no wonder you acted against me for a very long time with your threats and edits. It is just sad, just very sad to see such a bad faith in human being such as yourself. Even Serbs don't have such a huge amount of bad faith as I have been able to see in you. It's just sad, it's a catastrophy. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 08:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never read anything about the Srebrenica massacre, including the Wikipedia article. I'm not interested in third-party sources about it, socialist or otherwise. You seem to be, though. You have observed that I have made several edits to articles relating to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_Great_Britain_1500.html" title="Socialist Party of Great Britain">Socialist Party of Great Britain</a>. If you are curious as to what those socialists have to say about the violence following the breakup of Yugoslavia, there are at least two online aticles: <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org/articles/yugoslav_wars_myths_realities.php" class="external text" title="http://www.worldsocialism.org/articles/yugoslav_wars_myths_realities.php" rel="nofollow">The Yugoslav War‚ÄîMyths &amp; Realities</a> and <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/jan98/lead2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/jan98/lead2.html" rel="nofollow">Their Country Needs You</a>. Both articles defend neither the Serbs nor the Bosniaks, but rather deplore ethnic nationalism on both sides. ‚Äî<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 09:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am attempting to be neutral. I didn't know very much about this horrible tragedy until this article was brought to my attention. However, after spending several hours reading the article, its reversions, and the sources provided, I have to say that I believe that the changes proposed by Jim Douglas and other editors are the most in-line with Wikipedia's policies concerning <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I do not believe that the people reverting the article to the version that contains the neutral POV language (which also removes the BLP violations) are breaking WP rules. I recognize that what happend was a horrible, terrible thing: I don't think any of the people editing the article would disagree with that assertion. However, editors of Wikipedia have agreed to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, which means that we cannot write an article strictly from one viewpoint. I cannot tell you how much it hurts to recognize that humans are capable of carrying out such a horrifying action--reading this article made me shed more than a few tears. However, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>, and thus we must write articles that are neutral and contain <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Your stance, as a person directly affected by this tragedy, is understandably biased. Perhaps you should back away from this article, and trust other users to do their best in reporting all the facts associated with this horrible event. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 08:24, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Merobo, thank you for your kind words regarding Srebrenica. I honestly did not expect them. But thank you. What I am trying to point Merobo is the fact that I did discuss my changes. But Psychonaut (who had been blocked in the past for vandalism) did not discuss his changes before he started editing large chunks of Srebrenica Massacre article. It's a sensitive topic and it must be addressed thoroughly in a discussion page before major changes are made, do you agree with that? Yes you do. Having said that, he had not right to edit/delete large chunks of information before first discussing them with us. As I said, he had been blocked for vandalism in the past, so it would not be his first block. On Admin Notice board, you will notice his constant toddler-like complaining, usually against Bosniak editors (he has listed some of them, Bosoni, Bosniakk, etc, etc). He accuses me that I am on a mission and in bad faith, when he is exactly the who is on a mission to ban Bosniak editors from wikipedia; he is in a bad faith with his constant complaining and desecrations of Srebrenica Massacre article. His point of view is biased, as he openly sides with leftist opinions and does not aknowledge that a person who denies genocide is a genocide denier/revisionist, not a critic (this is not a movie). Imagine calling Holocaust deniers "critics"? Come on. He portrays his edits to be in good faith, but they are not, they can't be, he deleted large chunks of important data, just because he wants to impose his views onto the facts. He plays with the international judgements regarding Srebrenica Genocide.. The Srebrenica Massacre article is neutral as it can be, and it's a work in progress (not a finished product yet!). There are problems with the article and they are being fixed, but they cannot be fixed with people such has Psychonaut or Hadzija (Serbian guy who is totally biased and wants to equalize genocide with other war crimes). Having said that - we are still working on these issues, but they cannot be solved by simply repeatedly deleting large chunks of data that editor does not agree with. These issues need to be addressed on a discussion page and editors need to find a compromise and solution. That's a fair way to do it, and that's the way Srebrenica Massacre article has been edited for a very long time. Psychonaut's approach is wrong and goes in the face of hundreds of honest editors who discussed their changes thoroughly. He is just a bad faith editor who constantly complains. It's simple as that. Just go to Administrator Notice board and read his latest commplaint, which is totally one-sided with absolutely biased point of view. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 08:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

I refrained from complaining against you and I had tons of great reasons to do so, but I don't waste my time on complaints. I am not a toddler. I discuss my issues with other editors. And your anti-Bosniak stance, mission, and bad faith are visible from your last complaint on admin notice boards. The way you wrote your complaint is biased, it's in bad faith, it's distasteful because it's totally one sided, and you even forgot to mention that you were blocked for vandalism in the past, and yet you accuse me of vandalism.

<p>Bosniak: Normally, I'm very reluctant to modify another editor's talk and user pages. However, in this particular case, I feel that it is a serious misuse of the "You have new messages" display to have the link go to an external web site - <b>especially since there is no warning given</b>. This is also a potentially dangerous precedent, as a vandal may well be inspired to use the same method to create links to external pages with dangerous or malicious coding. Again, there would be no warning to the average user, who would believe that they were just responding to a message on Wikipedia. You might want to discuss this with an administrator who could better explain why such a link setup is not desirable. Thanks - please feel free to message me if you want to discuss. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 05:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are 100% correct about the Sarajevo Civil War article. I was recently in New York and came back yesterday to Chicago. I did have internet connection in the hotel room, however, some user (user:Nalco?) redirected the article to Siege of Sarajevo. At the time I was confused since I did not notice the redirect, so I found it strange why you would want to delete the article Siege of Sarajevo. Lol...Sorry, I would have reacted much earlier.

<p><b>Hi Bosniak</b>, you recently suggested, as a 'compromise', deleting the Alternative/Revisionist views section alltogether (or was it only the Mackenzie section, I'm not sure). As I mentioned in my reply on the Srebrenica Talk page, I would support such a 'compromise' if it was part of a 'package deal' for the entire article. I set out a couple of principles, which I believe are necessary if any true compromise is to succeed. Any thoughts?

I discovered an accusation there that you'd been meddling with the current consensus - of course this made no reference to where the current consensus actually comes from.

<p><b>Again</b>, I'm trying to avoid having to <b>compromise over opinions</b> by starting off with a bare bones recap of the ICTY findings. If we can all agree that the ICTY is a good source then basing the article on that should reduce the chances for opinions and disagreements about opinions. Given that the ICTY judgement against Krstic is soo thorough and widely accepted it really shouldn't be that hard to write an article based on it. What do you say?

<p><b>Bosniak's Reply:</b> No. That would certainly been false statement. I am sure there were cases of Orthodox Serbs converting to Islam, and Muslim Bosniaks converting to Orthodox religion. What I am saying is that Bosniaks are <b>not</b> Serbs who converted to Islam. I have one very nice Serbian friend. He has made a poem for Srebrenica genocide victims. There are still nice Serb people, and I am glad not all of them are same. Do you have any Bosniak friends? If not, you should find one and realize that Bosniak people don't bite.

<dd>Bosniacs are a very large nation of diverse ethnic origins (kindah like Americans, although are bound by Islam and Slavic origin to an extent, unlike economy &amp; statehood with the Amers - although I think most Bosniacs are atheists and even more agnostics). I think that it is possible that many families are of Serb, Croat or even Albanian origin. Sokolovic's a typical Serbian surname (and very often amongst Bosniacs), for example. "Ljajic" and "Ugljanin" are of Albanian descent. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 01:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Bosniak's Reply</b> There are certainly nice Serbs. I accept that genocide has been committed against Serbs in the 2nd World War, but I also expect you guys to acknowledge genocide against Bosniaks. Both <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustashe.html" title="Ustashe">Ustashe</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chetniks.html" title="Chetniks">Chetniks</a> were certainly not nice guys (as they like to portray themselves). I am not an enemy of the Serb people, although I will continue to oppose Srebrenica genocide denial, as well as claims that Bosniaks were Serbs who converted to Islam. Things are more complicated than they appear, and simplifying things to the point that Genocide did not happen or that Bosniaks are Serbs is immature. If I had power to kill and rape Serbs without being legally responsible for it - I still would not do it. In fact, when I was in Bosnia I was a child (during war) and my mother helped a lot of Serbian civilians by giving them food and milk powder that was used exclusively for the Croatian army. Anyways, I come from a peaceful family, but that doesn't mean that I should sit and peacefully accept genocide denial. These people in Srebrenica died under UN watch. What did UN do? Nothing, absolutely nothing. They even produced so called "NIOD Report" to wash their hands from genocide. When Dutch president came to Bosnia (I think his name was Mr Cock or Vock or whatever name he had), local reporters asked him whether or not he would apologize for Dutch troop involvement in the massacre, and he replied: "Never!". It's obvious that these people refuse to accept any serious responsibility. They even awarded Dutch troops with medals. Netherlands is a small country, and they are proud for getting so much attention with regards to their "heroic" involvement in the Balkans. Before massacre, nobody even knew where the Netherlands was. But after the genocide, they became very famous. You know what they say - no publicity is bad publicity. Netherlands never apologized. Their shameful NIOD report is full of inaccuracies. They should be ashamed of themselves. I debated few Dutch people on other online forums and whilethey fully accepted that genocide was committed, they never wanted to acknowledge any wrongdoing with respect to Dutch troops. Instead, they justified Dutch troop actions by stating they were lightly armed, etc (excuses, excuses, and more excuses). I will stop now...</p>
<p>Update: Yes, but the problem with Sokolovic is that there is no clear primary source evidence that he was Serbian. Please read this local article --- <a href="http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/MEHMED_PASA_SOKOLOVICH.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/MEHMED_PASA_SOKOLOVICH.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/MEHMED_PASA_SOKOLOVICH.html</a> As you can see from this article, it is very rather doubtful that he was of Serbian origin. There is no strong evidence that he was either Bosniak or Serb. Please read that source, you will learn more about his history (father, mother, sister, etc)... There is no "Serbian" or "Bosniak" or "Croat" last names. We all have "Slavic" last names and most of our last names end up in "-ic". For example, there are Bosniaks and Serbs with last name Obradovic. There are Croats as well as Serbs and Bosniaks with the last name "Bosnjak" (Bosniak). I would not be surprised to find Bosniaks and Croats with the last name Milosevic, as well as Serbs and Croats with the last name Izetbegovic.

<dd>Actually, I studied genealogies of tribes a lot. My expertise are the Montenegrin-Herzegovinian-Highland-Albanian-Serbian clans. I just gave an example about the Sokolovic surname, taking to granted that there are very little Serbs who still bear the name, whereas most are Bosniacs (over 60%-80%, I'd say). I can't remember of a typical Croatian surname worn by Bosniacs (implying Croat descent), but I already mentioned you the Albanians; and for Turkish origin you know yourself (I even know one Bosniac family of Hungarian descent [as emphasized by their family name]). --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 21:30, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not so sure about the copyright situation.

It is in the section "Press &amp; Public Info". It is well possible that it was released in the public domain.</p>
<p>As Psychonaut said, the metadata of that page indicates "Copyright ¬© 2001 QSS Ltd., All rights reserved." However, I find that dubious; QSS wrote the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content_management_system.html" title="Content management system">content management system</a> used to power the website and I guess that the meta-data is some default in the software.</p>
<p>It seems to be a useful image (not so much for <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>, but possibly for other articles). Bosniak, where did you want to use it? Perhaps we can write to the OHR and see what the situation is. But Psychonaut is right that you should be more careful not to violate any copyrights. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 05:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for clarifying the relationship of QSS to the web page content‚ÄîI agree now that the copyright notice may have been placed there by mistake. However, even if the Office intends for the maps to be reprinted by third parties, that doesn't necessarily place them in the public domain, nor under a free licence acceptable for use on Wikipedia. We need written confirmation from an authorized representative of the OHR that the images are provided under a <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>-compatible licence. Since such confirmation is nowhere to be found on the website, someone needs to write to the OHR to request it. Bosniak, if you want to do this, you should follow the guidelines at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a>. ‚Äî<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 12:54, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This insistence on policing copyright issues is reminiscent of Osli73's campaign about quotations from ICTY judgments when it was pretty obvious that that sort of material had been released into the public domain. It took me ages to get confirmation from the ICTY but when I did they told me (I can't remember the exact words) something along the lines that they were delighted for it to be used as long as there was proper attribution. Quibbling in the face of common sense is not necessarily unreasonable, but when it's almost always in one direction then its objectivity comes into question. The map is directly relevant to the Srebrenica Massacre article in that it provides the explanation for why ethnic cleansing and genocide took place. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 13:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll be brief. If the International Court of Justice determines in 6 hours time that a genocide did in fact occur throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992-1995 (regardless of whether Serbia and Montenegro are found directly responsible), then great efforts will have to be undertaken to improve the current Bosnian genocide article and prevent the inevitable wave of deniers and revisionists from utalizing it to their own ends. I believe that this responsibility will rest largely on those few of us who have defended the Srebrenica massacre article from similar assaults in the past. That is all. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 02:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whatever the findings of the ICJ with respect to proving genocide in Bosnia as a whole, genocide of the Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica was proved in Krstic. Whether or not the ICJ finds genocide proven in the case before it, unless the judgment specifically refutes the Krstic judgment and finds that genocide did not occur at Srebrenica the ICTY's finding stands. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 10:00, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're missing my point. Any unilateral bid for independence for Kosovo will certainly result in a so-called "<i>de facto</i> state" like Taiwan or Transnistria. The reason is that no one wants regions to be able to unilaterally declare independence. As for your assertion that control makes a difference, let me point out that it doesn't; Kosovo's legal status is the same as that of the RS, and independence for either would be done on the same legal principle. If Serbia loses Kosovo, then BiH should begin preparing to lose the RS, FYROM should be preparing to lose its Albanian-populated districts, Turkey should prepare to lose its Kurdish-populated provinces etc... etc... You say you dislike genocide, but with such an increased possibility of losing territory, let me tell you that the scale of ethnic cleansing currently underway in Kurdistan and Tibet will double.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 08:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just saying Bosnian Serb leadership is "putting up with it" only because Kosovo is in Serbia. The moment it secedes, your homeland will be in the greatest crisis ever since 1992.</p>
<p>Serbia <b>does</b> have <i>some</i> sovereignty over Kosovo (e.g. over <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Kosovo_cf52.html" title="North Kosovo">North Kosovo</a>). By the way, the 1244 Resolution also predicted the return of a part of the Serbian armed forces and police to Kosovo.</p>
<p>Why do you compare numbers? Isn't that pointless? Statistics? What will that tell you? Why should that be relevant? Anyway, you were slightly wrong - the pre-war Serb population of Kosovo foromed <b>11%-14%</b> (200,000-250,000; even now they form more than 5%, i.e. they form <i>7%</i>). The Bosnian Muslim pre-war population in the Serbian Republic was not even close 40% =&gt; it was <b>28.8%</b> (450,000).</p>

<p>Dear editors,</p>
<p>Please visit this version of the Srebrenica Massacre article to see the proposed changes to section 2.4: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;oldid=117151359" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;oldid=117151359" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;oldid=117151359</a></p>

<p>If there is no major objection, we would like to introduce this major edit to the article this Sunday March 25. This ought to give each editor the time they need to review the proposed changes before they are fully introduced.</p>
<p>The objective here is to make the article more concise while continuing to clearly state what happened and in no way obscure actual events.</p>
<p>A full review of the proposed changes to section 2.4 and the sub-article will show that all information regarding the executions has been preserved and presented in a clear manner.</p>

<p>Hi Bosniak,</p>
<p>I noticed you worked on the Srebrenica article. I want to ask for your help. I'm writing a paper/project in my history class at UPenn about the Balkan war (it was one of the offered topics). I read the article on Srebrenica massacre and I have decided to focus on that event. Any help is appreciated. I looked over the links, but I would appreciate a more specific info. The paper needs to be heavily documented with reliable sources AND we are NOT allowed to provide only one side of the story - meaning we can only use internatinal/objective sources. So, I need:</p>
<p>1) International sources on what led to the event (NATO, UN, EU reports? - something in english so that I can read it)</p>
<p>2) Where exactly can I find the official (international) estimate of the number of deaths? The link: "Federal Commission for Missing Persons; "Preliminary List of Missing and Killed in Srebrenica"; 2005" appears to be in Croatian (Serbian? Bosnian?), and from the site that does not belong to United Nations - therefore it not wise to use it. Do you have an actual link from some UN report that talks about these number? I looked around the web, but I believe with your experince, you might be able to point me to right direction. GREATLY APPRECIATED!</p>
<p>3) Similar to 2), I need the actual number of deaths - number of found bodies until now or until 2005/06. I hate to talk here about "numbers" when we are talking about people, please don't take this as my ignorance (I noticed you are from Bosnia). Do you have a specific link to United Nations site where these numbers are reported? AGAIN, GREATLY APPRECIATED.</p>
<p>4) Finally, I need some contrary views for completeness, but again, not from the involved sides. Clearly, Serbs will refute certain claims, Bosnians may do the opposite, so I need some international newspaper, book reports that actually provide different estimates (important: BOTH lower and higher).</p>
<p>So, I'm doing research on this myself, and once my research is done I would like to contribute to the article. If I have working links/references, they are not going to be deleted right? (here, I'm not talking about the regular hooliganism, but more about the regular contributors/editors)</p>
<p>Thanks, upenn_balkans</p>
<p>upenn-balkans, I've been working with Bosniak and others at the Srebrenica Massacre article. I'm sure Bosniak won't mind me intruding to give you some pointers he can add to.</p>
<p>The Federal Commission for Missing Persons first list of 8106 names is hosted (untranslated - but very simply the Bosnian text simply describes the list as a preliminary list of the dead and missing from Srebrenica) at the Domovina site which has close links with the ICTY It provides the video feed from the ICTY hearings) (see <a href="http://www.domovina.net/page_004.php" class="external free" title="http://www.domovina.net/page_004.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.domovina.net/page_004.php</a>). For some reason the Domovina site doesn't give the updated list of 8373 names hosted at the srebrenica-zepa site. 8373 is the number of names listed at the Potocari Memorial.</p>
<p>There is a lot of argument about the number of victims but you are safe using "an estimated 8000". The word "estimated" is used by propagandists as a means of trying to reduce the figure and I believe that the evidence available justifies using "at least". Nevertheless it is important to the memory of the unlisted victims to remember that although there is some uncertainty about precise numbers this does not mean that higher figures are unreasonable. The numbers are based on lists compiled from reports of the dead and missing. In the circumstances of three years of ethnic cleansing and random and organised violence in the Drina Valley and the Srebrenica area, there are may be whole families who left no surviving relatives to report their deaths, and most of the lists required corroboration of names by close family.</p>
<p>The Krstic trial judgment given in August 2001 found:</p>
<p>"84. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that, in July 1995, following the take-over of Srebrenica, Bosnian Serb forces executed several thousand Bosnian Muslim men. The total number is likely to be within the range of 7,000 -8,000 men."</p>
<p>When Krstic's appeal was considered the ICTY Appeal Chamber judgment noted in April 2004:</p>
<p>"2. [...] The depravity, brutality and cruelty with which the Bosnian Serb Army (‚ÄúVRS‚Äù) treated the innocent inhabitants of the safe area are now well known and documented.1 Bosnian women, children and elderly were removed from the enclave,2 and between 7,000 ‚Äì 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men were systematically murdered."</p>
<p>The recent International Court of Justice judgment, drawing on the original ICTY judgments, now several years old, reads "290. The Trial Chambers in the Krstiƒá and Blagojeviƒá cases both found that Bosnian Serb forces killed over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men following the takeover of Srebrenica in July 1995". (Krstiƒá, IT-98-33-T, Judgment, 2 August 2001, paras. 426-427 and Blagojeviƒá, IT-02-60-T, Judgment, 17 January 2005, para. 643)."</p>
<p>The International Committee for Missing Persons is now part of the Missing Persons Institute with the Federal Commission. It provides a useful appreciation of the forensic evidence and their estimate of what they believe the final number of victims will be. In my suggested revision of the "Forensic evidence" paragraphs of the "Mass executions" section of the Srebrenica massacre article I have summarised the account of the work of the ICMP contained in a very recent response by Adam Boys, senior manager for the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP), to reader's comments on an article in The Scotsman in early March as:</p>
<p>"As of 2007, the remains of more than 6500 individuals have been exhumed from the Srebrenica region and identified or DNA-profiled."</p>
<p>This is based on my summary of Boys's discussion of the Forensic evidence as:</p>
<p>"The progress of finding bodies of victims in the Srebrenica region, often in mass graves, exhuming them and finally identifying them was relatively slow. By 2002, 5,000 bodies were exhumed but only 200 were identified. The pioneering use of DNA has allowed the identification of large numbers of victims whose body parts were widely dispersed. As of 9 March 2007 the International Committee for Missing Persons had collected and processed blood samples from 21,032 family members representing 7789 different missing individuals and the DNA-led identification process had helped in the final legal identification of 2913 persons from Srebrenica, 2528 already buried at Potocari Memorial Center or other graveyards. Comparison of the DNA profiles from 8369 bone samples from exhumed remains with profiles with the ICMP database of blood-sample DNA profiles has provided direct genetic information for 4100 missing individuals. While the ICMP doubts that it will ever be possible to determine the exact final number of victims, on the basis of the rate of blood collection and DNA matches to date they estimate the number of persons missing from the fall of Srebrenica would be around 8000."</p>
<p>You can check the full text of Adam Boys's comments after C. Jennings's article "Finding the bodies to fill the Bosnia graves," in The Scotsman, 14 March 2007 at <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=398822007" class="external free" title="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=398822007" rel="nofollow">http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=398822007</a></p>
<p>Hope that helps. I'm sure Bosniak will have more to add. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 12:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Bosniak's reply:</b></p>
<p>Hi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Upenn_balkans&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Upenn_balkans&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">Upenn_balkans</a>, pardon me for not replying earlier because I don't read my TalkPage (because people usually come here to criticize me). I can certainly help you with your essay. You can send me email to my temporary hotmail account at danielfromuniverse@hotmail.com . Remember, presenting both sides of the story does not mean you should morally equate what Serbs did. You should present both sides of the story but you should not shy away from admitting that Serbs are to blame. To present Serb side of the story, please use credible sources, here is a good start (please read carefully, it's from the International Criminal Tribunal): <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2005/PB050706.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2005/PB050706.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2005/PB050706.htm</a> (about alleged Serb victims). All the best. Also, keep an eye at <a href="http://bavault.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://bavault.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://bavault.blogspot.com</a> - it has great sources and the editor in charge is very knowledgeable (I'll meet you with her, and we can both help you).</p>
