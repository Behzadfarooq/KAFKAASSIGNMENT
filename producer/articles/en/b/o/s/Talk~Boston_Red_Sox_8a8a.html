<p>I have reverted, and added the sources in order to clarify. Those "highly respected sources" merely parroted the same misinformation that has been out there for 50 or 60 years without bothering to research it. But a SABR member named Bill Nowlin actually went back to the newspapers from that time period and determined that the "Puritans"/"Pilgrims" stuff is bogus. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:04, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take a deep breath, calm down, this needs to be civil. Please do not edit my comments; you can fix spelling in the article, but not on the talk page. I have reverted the misspelling in my above comment and please leave it be. Your edit to the article is still POV (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>}; you say "never" yet I have official publications of Major League Baseball stating otherwise, thereby nullifying the term "never" which is an inappropriate use of the word, and I believe John Thorn and Pete Palmer are also SABR members so they should know. If you can give me a SABR reference, then I will believe it. Until then, you cannot represent what is not yet fully accepted in baseball circles. Even the above comment by Hayford Peirce says he was going to do more research and edit as necessary - he never did state his findings nor make any edit to the page. I personally am not really interested in it, but "never" is an inappropriate stance. In the mean time, I have lessened the POV of the edit and combined it to show both sides. Once SABR fully embraces it, I think you have a point, but until then, it should be left open.

<p>You are in deed, or indeed, lacking a sense of humor. I'm not the one who put the emphasis on <i>never</i>, someone else did that. In fact, I'm not sure whether I even used the word "never", which I agree is a risky absolute. And the sources <i>were</i> listed earlier in the year, and someone excised them. Here's the deal: Bill Nowlin's writeup, copied on the Baseball Almanac page, first appeared in the SABR publication <i>The National Pastime</i>, No. 23, in the summer of 2003. Nowlin actually went back to the best source available, the newspapers of that time, researched the matter thoroughly, and found no evidence that the team was ever widely known as the Pilgrims or the Puritans, <i>if at all</i>. And near as I can tell, NO ONE besides Nowlin has bothered to do any actual research on the matter, they've all simply parroted this stuff for many years. What supposedly "credible sources" have to say about it now has <i>no relevance</i> when stacked up against what <i>contemporary</i> sources had to say (or not say) about it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:40, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Conventional wisdom" is a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">weasel term</a>. At least what the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and SABR recognize is not totally removed from the article; although it is still POV. Even the article that was provided as a <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml" rel="nofollow">source</a> is one man's opinion - if you can provide me a Bill James article, I will buy you dinner. No offense, but you seem to be heavily invested in the anti-Puritan camp and are presenting more emotion than fact. Can I ask you to step back for awhile and discuss it at a later time? Please leave the article as it is for now. <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWriters_rules_of_engagement_cc4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Writers rules of engagement">Work toward agreement</a>.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyTalk_c937.html" title="User:CrazyTalk">CrazyTalk</a> 01:16, 23 September 2005 (UTC) <i>(BTW, your statement "You are in deed, or indeed, lacking a sense of humor," appears to be atacking me, not the issue.)</i></dd>

<p>I was tweaking you for going ballastic over my schoolmarm-like correction of "in deed" to "indeed", that's the only "personal" part about it. I could have thrown "Somersets" into the list, it just seemed less important. I doubt if Bill James has ever written about it, he's mostly a "figger filbert". You say it's one man's "opinion", but HE DID THE RESEARCH, and apparently <i>not</i> to discredit it, but to try to <i>confirm</i> it, only he <i>couldn't</i> because IT AIN'T TRUE. No one else has bothered to do any real research, they just repeat the same stuff over and over. You'd be surprised how many people still think Abner Doubleday invented baseball, which is false... or Alex Cartwright, which is not verifiably true either. I'm not emotionally invested in the Red Sox, I just like to see true facts presented (which is a SABR credo), rather than the usual hand-me-down "conventional wisdom", which if you can come up with a better term, feel free. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:12, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I softened down the supposed POV further, and included a reference to "Somersets". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:17, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone should mention how they blew a 5 game lead and the Yankees won the East again this year Maddux31holytrinity</p>
<p>Considering their injury problems, it's surprising the Beantowners held on as long as they did. However, let's not jump to any conclusions about anybody's chances. Don't forget that the Chicago White Sox (!) will hold the home field edge throughout the post-season, and since they seem to be getting back on track, there is always a chance they will be this year's Red Sox. Being a Chicago North Sider, though, it matters not to me. 0:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:25, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that in the last month or so one or two <b>New York Times</b> sportswriters have written columns in which they trace the phrase back to about 1976, give or take a year. About the time of the Bucky Dent fiasco, I think. One of them, I recall, wrote that <i>maybe</i> he was the one who originated it.

<dd>The earliest reference I can find using the keywords "Curse" and "Babe Ruth" is the Oct 28, 1986 edition of the NYT (page D33), a headline in the Sports of the Times section titled "Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again", by George Vecsy, written after the Mets' victory that year. -<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 03:51, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an update - I found an article in the previous day's paper, Oct 27, 1986, also by George Vecsy, titled "Why the Mets are still alive" (Page C3) which also mentiones the Curse of Babe Ruth. Another article the day after talks about Boston being haunted by the "curse" of old ghosts, i.e. the loss of previous World Series. I can find no other references to the Babe Ruth curse prior to 1986. -<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 08:33, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Jonathancjudd 18:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC) The very last sentence in this section "<i>The <b>trade</b> of Ruth led to a downfall in the Sox fortunes, which would not change until 1939.</i>" contradicts the first sentence of the section, which states Ruth was <b>sold</b>. In either case, the mention of the entire "curse" is not appropriate for an encyclopedic article.</p>

<dd>I didn't remove this, but I will repeat that this page is about the franchise. I'd damn well hope that famous former players would show up for their team in the World Series, but in terms of someone who had NOTHING to do with the game in any way, shape or form (like Affleck), it doesn't need to be here!
<dl>
<dd>I agree, what is the point? Shall we list every minor celebrity in the crowd so that people can look back and say, "It's not important that the Sox won their first Series in nearly a century, because Ben Affleck and Tom Hanks were there and had a good time and that's what counts."</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the same way, a space for Game 2 play-by-play with the note "Game 2 data will go here." is useless.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>not useless, its stops folks from modifying sections that dont need modification in order to put in the play-by-play which will get added whether we want it or not.

<p>Calm down, guys. There is bound to be disagreement over an article dealing with breaking events ... when the Series is over (insert obligatory team-boosting comment here) and blood stops boiling, it will be much easier to examine this article dispasionaltely. Don't get too worked up or Wikipedia will kill you through high blood pressure. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 03:19, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC) (in N.H. and surrounded by Red Sox fanatics, incidentally)</p>
<p>My own opinion is that in order to avoid cluttering the Red Sox main page, which ought to be about the team itself rather than being a detailed account of its performance, I would be in favor of moving the 2004 postseason section to its own page. It makes little sense for a majority of this article to be devoted to a single postseason in the team's long history. However, I tend to think that a play-by-play is highly unnecessary, especially since it would be more appropriately placed in an article about the World Series itself. Perhaps just a scoring summary. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 07:56, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC) (in Cambridge, MA, and surrounded by people who don't particularly care about baseball but root for the Red Sox by default, incidentally)</p>
<p>I agree with you Aerion, this is a page about the team and it's history not a performance record... that should seperated and we should focus more on the history-making events! Either that or just have people go the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_American_League_Championship_Series_1284.html" title="2004 American League Championship Series">2004 ALCS</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_World_Series_ea20.html" title="2004 World Series">World Series</a> pages.

<p>I gotta say I agree with you. We should calm down and enjoy the Series. But damn is Alkivar pissing me off right now. Not only did he curse me out in the above conversation, he then <i>deleted it</i>, saying "we both looked like hotheaded idiots." I think I might look like an idiot now, but I figure I had every right to say what I said up there. Further, after a brief search through the rules, I see nothing about wholesale deletion of a substantiative conversation. Refactoring? Yes, <i>after time has passed</i>. Deleting personal attacks? Yes, so maybe the "it's not your fucking page!" should go. But deleting a useful conversation? That should not happen. And in any case, if any of it should be removed as irrelevant, <i>that's not our job</i> because we're clearly not impartial! [sarcasm]And clearly I can't do it because I've only been here for "two weeks if that" while you've been here for <i>months</i>![/sarcasm]<br />
When I was saying that "Johnny Pesky was there, and Kelly Clarkson sang God Bless America during the seventh inning stretch" didn't belong, I <i>didn't</i> mean that it was entirely irrelevant. It fits in just fine on the 2004 WS page, as I said. However, does this article say who sang the national anthem at each game of the 1986 World Series? No, because it's a trivial detail that's not related to the franchise.<br />
In short, the conversation you removed should stay, for the reasons Aerion mentioned below. It's a good way to avoid arguments from popping up if someone starts typing up how Pedro is doing in the second inning. [In reality, the entire two sections on 2004 will and probably should be reduced to a couple paragraphs, win or lose, sometime over the winter.] <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonpin_ad98.html" title="User:Jonpin">Jonpin</a> 22:09, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you're right, you are continuing to "look like an idiot." But good points nonetheless.

<p>Do the riots that occured after this year's ALCS win deserve to be mentioned somewhere in the 2004 postseason section?

<p>I have found three errors (actually, one is just a poorly communicated sentence) in the 2004 season entry. The Red Sox overcame a 5-run deficit in the July 24th game (down 9-4). Olerud's Yankees were already leading 1-0 in ALCS Game 2, though the entry currently implies that Olerud's team was trailing. Lastly, the 14 inning Game 5 was the longest by innings in American LCS history, but ranked behind the Mets/Astros in 1986 (16 innings) and the Mets/Braves in 1999 (15 innings) as the longest League Championship Series games, as the entry currently claims.</p>

<p>Perhaps whoever wrote that bit about the eclipse being "fitting" should explain their metaphor a little more, as it's not terribly obvious right now. I realize that my deletion of "total darkness" may have made it even less clear, but the fact is that it wasn't total darkness. The moon is still very much visible during a total eclipse, it's just somewhat darker and redder.

<dd>i'm the one who originally added that statement. As the Sox blanked the cardinals 3-0 it sorta compares to the shadow of the earth blanking the moon does it not?

<p>Some well-meaning anonymous editor has been posting what he considers to be the primary rivals of each major league team. For example, for the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> he had the Cubs, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, Giants and Cardinals. The only one of those that makes sense is the Yankees. It is not at all clear where he came up with the others, aside from the fact that they have played in the World Series at some point in the past, or possibly recently in interleague play.</p>
<p>In fact, it's effectively a "Point of View", is it not? Some rivalries are obvious because of the hype: Yankees-Red Sox, Cubs-Cardinals, Giants-Dodgers, and also any two teams in the same city or at least in close proximity, which were initially just <i>financial</i> rivals until interleague play came along: Yankees-Mets, Cubs-Sox, Dodgers-Angels, A's-Giants.</p>
<p>But to label other interleague competitors as "main" rivals is rather a stretch. To do it objectively, you would have to look at average attendance figures of a given team vs. any statistically significant increase vs. specific visiting teams. That could be hard to do at a place like Fenway or Wrigley, which generally sell out no matter what. A better approach would be to compare TV ratings, where available.</p>
<p>Does anyone have time to go through all that research, just to try and prove which teams are "main" rivals? I certainly do not. Maybe someone else would. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 4 July 2005 03:03 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fellas, get off your high horse for a second here. The additions of players like Alcantara, Benzinger and Pemberton were made as a goof. If this is such a sacred list, then why do you already have guys such as the immortal Randy Kutcher, Carlos Quintana, Rob Murphy and Chris Stynes on there? Not to mention the inclusion of Frank Tanana, who pitched all of 24 games for the Sox and went 4-10 in that short stint. Now while a lot of forgettable players were added, there were also several noteworthy guys put on the list that you had previously missed, and virtually every one has a stub. Also, positions were added as well. So open your mind and please stop changing everything that was created by someone outside the regular Boston Red Sox Wikipedia circle. Thanks.</p>

<p>The statement "2005 could be considered the 6th division title" is patently false. MLB rules <a href="http://www.all-baseball.com/ref/tie.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.all-baseball.com/ref/tie.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> state quite clearly that "the" division champion is the team with the best record, or if tied, the team that wins certain tiebreakers. There is no provision for a "shared" division title; in all scenarios, a single team is the division champion. The 2005 Red Sox can certainly claim their wild card berth, but there is no valid reason to state that 2005 is also a division title, whether it "should be" or "would be" historically. The statement at the beginning of the article seems fairly obvious POV. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 16:59, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In 1979, the Baltimore Orioles won the division title. I assume you mean 1978. After 162 games, they were tied with the Yankees, and a 163rd game (a playoff game) was held to decide the winner, because only one of the two could go to the post-season. In 2005 (as with 2001 in the NL Central), there was no need for a playoff game because both teams already qualified for the post-season. Had the Indians swept the White Sox this past weekend, there would have to have been a playoff scenario. That's why the news reported after this past Saturday that the Yankees win <i>along with the Indians' loss</i> gave the Yankees the division championship. Red Sox Nation can rightly say they finished with the same <i>record</i> as the Yankees in 2005, but they are incorrect if they claim it to be a division <i>co-champion</i>. There is no such thing, not now, and not in 1978, either. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:51, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that this shouldn't be included at this point. However, if the Red Sox organization claims to be 2005 AL East co-champs at some point in the future (like the Cardinals did in 2001) then we'll have to add a note similar to the one on the St. Louis page. - <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal_3bfe.html" title="User:Pal">Pal</a> 18:02, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simishag, I guess this is why you are having a serious problem here. That is actually false, as Wahkeenah notes. This is NOT why the Sox did not win in 1978. The Yankees would have won a tiebreaker (having a better division record) in 1978, but there was no such thing: they had a playoff game. This is new, and as it has happened only once before, many people don't understand it -- including you, as you just showed by comparing it to 1979 [sic] -- and thus a note is worth having. -- <a href="http://pudge.net/" class="external free" title="http://pudge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pudge.net/</a></dd>

<dd>It is at best trivia and at worst fanboy BS, and at least 4 people over the past 2 days felt strongly enough about it to revert it. Your statement "this could be considered the 6th division title" implies some level of consensus. Yankees fans certainly wouldn't agree. Sports writers wouldn't agree. MLB wouldn't agree. If you wanted to say "Red Sox fans sentimentally claim this as a 6th division title", and put it in a place a little less obvious than the top of the page, that might be acceptable, but rules are rules, and the rules say the Yanks won it this year. There is simply no provision for a shared division title, not now and not then. The fact that they have the same record at the end of the year is interesting, but it does not mean they won the division, not now and not then. Whether they would have won it "historically" is irrelevant to 2005. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 18:26, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So when many Yankees fans are asking me to explain how the team with the best record didn't win the division -- something that has only happened once before in the major leagues -- they are being Red Sox fanboys? Stop being stupid. And so what if it is trivia; what about the page isn't? You really think this is less important than the fact that Sweet Caroline is played in the middle of the eighth inning? Stop being stupid. And "my statement" is not mine. Check your History. That was from the St. Louis Cardinals' page, and Jredmond put it in, not me; if you didn't like that, then you could have changed that one part. As to sports writers: did you take a poll? Stop being stupid. Really. And if you don't like my tone, you can stuff it: you're the one who is removing edits without even understanding what they were about, and then went on to get all self-righteous about it. -- <a href="http://pudge.net/" class="external free" title="http://pudge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pudge.net/</a></dd>

<dd>I don't get why any sports fan would be astute enough to look at the standings and yet be so ignorant as to not understand, in a one-sentence explanation if necessary, why the Yankees get the division title and the Red Sox get the wild card. Most MLB fans follow the NFL, I should think. And ties at the top of a division happen from time to time, it's no big deal. I think what's really afoot here is the erroneous assumption that winning a title still means something in a qualitative sense. Once the wild card was introduced, its meaning dropped significantly. As with the other major sports, winning a division is simply an automatic playoff berth and a degree of home field edge, and maybe some kind of dime-store trophy. That's all. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Red Sox are obviously an emotional issue for you, as your link makes clear: "The MLB rules are retarded", "Screw it, I am declaring the Sox the champs", etc. You're welcome to your opinion, of course, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article. Also, you might want to stop making statements about "the team with the best record." The Sox did not, of course, have THE single best record, or we wouldn't be having this discussion. All you have to tell your Yankees friends (who are just having some fun with you, by the way; I'm sure THEY know the rules) is that MLB has tiebreaker rules for exactly this purpose. Your assertion that this is some sweeping new change that caught everyone by surprise is, of course, ridiculous; MLB implemented these rules when it went to its current playoff format in 1995(?), so it's not like people didn't know that this would be the exact mechanism for deciding the division winner. The fact that this is the first time it's ended up this way is interesting I suppose, but it is not "unfair" or "stupid" or anything else. As for trivia: personally I don't care either way whether the songs are mentioned, but it is a fact that they are played (well, actually, I don't know if they are, but no one has disputed it), and perhaps it is part of team lore and thus worthy of mention. But hey, that's why we have discussion pages like this, to hash this stuff out. Your assertion that the Sox are somehow entitled to claim a division title is disputable, is in fact disputed by others here, and you are therefore remiss if you fail to note the dispute (Wiki's rule, not mine).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, it's not about self-righteousness, it's about having a quality article. This is not my article, nor is it yours, so telling me to "stuff it" is childish. If you can't stand to see your copy edited, maybe you shouldn't be editing. I certainly wasn't the only person who thought it was a lousy edit. Pal's edit under "2005" is substantially better, and correctly frames the issue without making a bogus claim about a shared division title. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 23:50, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

Nothing about co-division titles. That could conceivably come later and, as someone above noted, that could be worth discussing in the article. The Cardinals didn't like being relegated to the wild card in 2005, but claiming to be co-champs <i>don't make it so</i>. The major leagues' governing body make the rules, not the individual teams, or the media, or the fans. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:55, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMO the section on the 2005 season and the 2005 post-season is far too long. The 2004 section is probably too long as well but because of winning the World Series and beating the Yankees in such dramatic fashion warrant some attention I can mainly understand that section's length.</p>

<li>I took the tour at Fenway Park earlier this year and one of the guides said there were three requirements (10+ seasons w/ Sox, in BOH, and retire as Sox).

<p>After Fisk got elected into the HOF, we was hired by the Sox as a "special assistant" or consultant or something.

<dd>I reverted the DH to infielder header change to reflect how the Red Sox officially list their roster.

<p>The opening line read something to the effect that the Yankee/Sox rivalry is the greatest and most intense rivalry in [b]sport[/b].</p>
<p>I changed it to Baseball, as I can think of around ten sporting rivalries that are far, far more intense and have a lot more history than the Sox/Yankees.</p>
<p>Rangers/Celtic in Scotland's Premier League "soccer" is a rivalry based in religion that has been going since the 1800's, and regularly leads to violence.</p>
<p>River Plater/Boca Juniors in Argentina is even hotter!</p>
<p>Since the quotation has no citation, it can't be left there, especially since it is arguably hyperbole.</p>
<p>Well, since you mentioned two rivalries outside of the United States, one can still make a very valid arguement that the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry is the greatest in professional American sports. It might be a stretch to call it the greatest in all American sports, since the collegiate rivalries of Harvard/Yale (football), Army/Navy (football), Ohio State/Michigan (football), North Carolina/Duke (basketball) can stake claim in that title.</p>

<p>Dan Duquette never said that Roger Clemens was "in the twilight of his career." His statement was that Red Sox management wanted to keep Clemens in a Boston uniform "<b>during</b> the twilight of his career," with the full implication of the statement in context indicating that to be sometime in the future. This is consistent with what is written elsewhere in Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Clemens_2c5d.html" title="Roger Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> for instance), and is verifiable in the archives of the Boston Herald.</p>

<dd>Considering the way the rest of the article is structured, at some point the last several years should be merged into something like a "current era" heading. If entire decades can be summed up in a single subsection, there probably doesn't need to be lengthy bits about every single one of the last few seasons.

<dd>One or two chunks of subject matter should be shipped out to other articles. Maybe everything on the 2006 team to one article, maybe all roster data to one article. Those are two extremely-overlapping suggestions that will ship out one chunk of subject matter. Of course, such strategies should be cover all MLB or all big-time team sports. To ship out a long history article, leaving only a short summary here, should or should not be implemented much more generally: for Astronomy or Copenhagen one might do the same export when the main article gets too big. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 01:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the preferred order for Notes, See also, External links, References --in particular where, as here, there is a substantial footnote? Nothing looks right.</p>
<p>Information should probably be rearranged between Notes (newly relegated) and the Nickname section, Pilgrims? subsection. Bill Nowlin and some recent SABR publications were one third of Nickname, with too much detail. That material might be rewritten as a good paragraph focusing on 1901-1907 nicknames, and I hinted that by making subsections, but I didn't do the work. Instead I simply relegated to Notes the part about his 2006 followup article, which moderated his previous finding. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 01:51, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In 2004 the Sox were between 6 and 12 games over .500 from game 27 through game 110. Then they went on a 20-2 tear. This should be mentioned, and if someone can figure out the difference in the wild card standings this tear made, that info should be added as well.</p>

<p>Hi. I created a template to go at the bottom of all Red Sox-related pages. But as of now, the links it has are not really great. So, if anyone can help improve the template, that would be really helpful. Don't put it on any pages, yet, because I want to make sure it's great before it is put anywhere.

<p>I hope that this doesn't come across too strongly against the person that wrote the majority of the section, but the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html#Nickname" title="Boston Red Sox">Nickname section</a> needs some serious work. The structure of the information that is there is confusing, unrefrenced, and most of it is only marginally related to the topic of the Red Sox name in my opinion. The other problem is that this section ought to be moved to become a part of the History section. As it is it's sitting on it own shoehorned in between "individual player-introduction music", and "Retired numbers", and is a bit lost. The structure of the overall page is confusing right now, and this section is one of the reasons why.</p>
<p>In my opinion this section should be reduced to a deacently sized paragraph of referenced materiel. Two short sub sections should have a link to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Pilgrims_5fdb.html" title="Boston Pilgrims">Boston Pilgrims</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Americans_69fe.html" title="Boston Americans">Boston Americans</a> as the respective main articles for each section.</p>
<p>I started looking at this as I was looking into editing the 1903 World Series article. Obviously, the Boston Pilgrims/Americans nickname problem is connected to the 1903 series. I was about to be bold and begin fixing this myself, but as I read the articles and looked at the problem itself I find myself realising what a large change this is. I am not a Red Sox fan, or even a particular expert at Red Sox history so the last thing I want to do is start an edit controversy on this page. The article needs work to fit into the encyclopedia, though. As it is, if you read/edit other parts of Wikipedia and come here this article as it stands is obviously not like the rest of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../o/h/m/User%7EOhms_law_8137.html" title="User:Ohms law">Ohms law</a> 10:42, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Roughly the same amount of space is devoted to pre-2002 as to post-2002 in this article.

However, I have to respectfully disagree with this decision. If you look at the history for this page, <b>nearly every single change of the last 250+ edits</b> is either vandalism or a revision. Does anyone else think this is a little ridiculous? Zomic_13 17:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the encyclopedic content is strong, then it ought to be integrated into the already existing section, not just tacked onto the end. The section already discusses at least Jim Rice and Roger Clemens, so why not combine it together nicely instead of having it on the end?
