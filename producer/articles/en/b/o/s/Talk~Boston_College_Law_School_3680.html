<p>All pictures so far uploaded are from the BC undergraduate Wiki page or from the Boston College Law School website. Noting so that they are not removed for unknown sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The photos of the main campus are not relevant to the law school article, and those from the law school website are most likely not fair use. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroitet_2326.html" title="User:Droitet">Droitet</a> 00:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The photos are clearly relevant, as Boston College is a university and not merely a law school. One of the pictures included BCLS students studying in an library on the main campus explicitly designated for law and graduate students. Pictures from the website are clearly fair use, as they are in the public domain and being used for educational purposes on an educational website. Please do not remove pictures. Further tampering may result in revocation of the privilege to contribute to the website. Thank you for your time. Mod.</p>
<dl>
<dd>uhhh WTF? A) The law school is on an entirely different campus. B) Babst does <i>not</i> have an area specifically for law students. And even if there were, how do you know that is where the picture is from and that those students are specifically law students? That picture is in the main area of Babst and those students are most likely undergraduates. C) There is no such thing as a "Mod" on Wikipedia and even if you were in a position of authority preventing someone from editing the page would have to be backed up with lots of supporting evidence that proves your point, which is clearly lacking. I'm removing the irrelevant pictures.<a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 00:49, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I can clear this up, as I am a current law student. The discussion is interesting and I think both of you have some strong arguments. However, there is no such thing as a moderator on wikipedia, so I am not sure what that was about. As for BCLS, the law school is on newton campus which is connnected to main campus and where most law students actually study and many of the classes are taught. However, at least 30% of my section during my first year studied in the Oneil and Bapst libraries. Ironically, my study group is currently in the Bapst graduate student area which BC has expressly explained is for graduate and law students only, so that was actually a valid point. I also agree that the original poster who titled the picture as indicating that they were law students in the picture was out of line; there is no indication that those are law students and that caption should been removed. In sum, Boston College Law School is apart of Boston College just as any other law school is apart of their greater university. This is not a completely seperate campus, such as Georgetown University Law Center, where the law school is actually in a different area and students dont use the other campus. BCLS uses both campus both for studying and for classes. Therefore the pictures that the OP wanted are valid. However, this should be explained in a portion of the explanation. I hope this explains BCLS a little better, and some of this should be explained in the substance of the page, as it is not clear whether BCLS is independent from the greater University, like GULC, or actually apart of the University. The latter is the correct answer, as both law student experience and BC marketing have indicated. This is not an attack on either of you, as I agree with both the picture poster and the picture remover.</p>

<dd>I guess that shows how much I study in Babst! Out of curiosity, where is this section in Babst? I've been to the main section where the picture in question was taken, but I don't recall seeing a section specifically for graduate students. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 21:49, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Haha, the area is the raised area on teh first floor. It has a sign stating that it is for graduate students only. However, I see undergarduates up there every now and then, but its usually fairly empty. The upstairs area was deleted becuase that is not the area reserved for graduate students, although it is a beautiful room.</p>

<p>I have edited out a couple of sentences which I felt made this article too POV for Wikipedia standards. please do not use boastful terms such as "prestigious" when describing a university. it is highly POV.</p>
<p>"Considered a highly prestigious American <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law school</a>, BC Law graduates are some of the most highly recruited law students in New England. Its reputation as one of the most prestiguous non-ivy league Universities in New England has led many, including former President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, to nickname Boston College as the "<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_Ivy_7d0c.html" title="Jesuit Ivy">Jesuit Ivy</a>.""</p>
<p>I could not find a way to edit this sentence into a non-POV so i decided to just omit it. Thanks.</p>
<p>I've reverted this article back so that it mirrors BUSL wikipage. The two should look the same regarding presentation of facts. terrier08 11:20, August 7 2006</p>

<p>It looks like some jealous BU Law School students have been trying to sabotage this wiki article. Some BU Law School students are clearly trying to make BU appear to be superior to Boston College Law School when it's just the opposite. BU only recently surpassed BC in the US News rankings and the Brody rankings still have BC higher, yet someone from BUSL IP address continues to change the BCLS wikipage. I've ran the IP checks on some of the editors, and there were a couple whose IP addresses were traced back to Boston University directly. 10:00, August 6 2006 (CTU)</p>

<p>Being someone not partial to either institution, the repetitive use of "jesuit ivy" is POV and does not add to the factual content of the article.</p>
<p>The school uses the nickname a great deal, and it is often referred to as such. The POV is based on an american president's speach, which is clearly credible. However, if you disagree with the statement, try discussing it on the boston college page, as the speach was made about and the term is used in reference to the entire institution as well.</p>

<p>I'd like to propose that eagleionline.com be listed as a link on the bottom of the BC law page, as it seems to fill in a gap after <a href="http://bceagles.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://bceagles.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bceagles.blogspot.com/</a> (The Boston College Blog) became defunct.

<p>Is it true that "Boston College Law students popularly use the epithet 'that's BC lawyering' to describe an act of exceptional wit and ingenuity that has a sense of absurdity"? I've spent quite a bit of time at BC Law and I have never heard or read the phrase except on Wikipedia. Eagle1492 03:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Take it down (I won't be at BC Law until the fall, so my hands are tied right now, but as a frequent wiki user, I'm pretty sure that "That's BC Lawyering" is not a common phrase) Since Eagle1492 might not log in for a while, I ask any BC Law student to remove the BC Lawyering comment if you haven't heard it during your time at BC Law (at this time (April), most students have been there at least 8 months and if the phrase is used commonly they certainly would have heard it by now) Megacake 07:58, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any need to copy verbatim large portions of BC Law's website on to Wikipedia. I don't believe any of the content in the entire section contains original syntheses of ideas. What is the rationale for putting all this information in on "clinics"? It seems to me like the same rationale would justify listing all the courses BC Law offers, as well, or for that matter, a list of the faculty. Perhaps it would make the entire article stronger to say something to the effect that BC Law offers many clinics, and then simply list them (in summary form?) without long descriptions. Eagle1492 03:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. It's against Wiki policy I believe, I'm removing it because I believe it to be severely unencyclopedic (why are clinics highlighted and not other parts of BC Law?) I believe the case should have to be made for, not against, this section. If there are any wiki superiors who know protocol for something like this and want to intercede, feel free, but for now, I'm removing it. Megacake 08:01, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't even think this deserves a discussion, but I'm changing the campus type from 'urban' to suburban, the campus is in Newton, a suburb of Boston and has no urban feel to it whatsoever.Megacake 19:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
