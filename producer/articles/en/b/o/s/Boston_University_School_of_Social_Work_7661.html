<p>"The Boston University School of Social Work is committed to education which furthers social and economic justice in the urban environment and strives to incorporate this commitment into its programs and activities. The School is especially concerned with empowerment of all oppressed groups. BUSSW recognizes the ever-changing demands on the profession and strives to meet them through the highest quality of teaching, scholarship, research, practice, and political action. BUSSW's aim is to educate professional social workers who will become leaders in a complex, diverse, and multicultural society. They will possess the knowledge and the skills to address the needs and potentials of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. The School offers an integrated program of study, including clinical and macro social work methods. It emphasizes the engagement of personal and community strengths as fundamental to the understanding, treatment and prevention of individual and social problems.</p>
<p>BUSSW has five goals that are derived from this mission. Both student learning, faculty, and broader School objectives emanate from the five goals. Eleven student learning objectives are incorporated into course and field instruction. Multiple outcome measures ensure program effectiveness. In accord with the School's mission, the major goals of BUSSW are to:</p>
<p>I. Provide students with a sound base of knowledge and skills to engage in advanced social work professional practice in a diverse and multicultural society through an integrated program of study, using Clinical and Macro Social Work methods.</p>
<p>II. Provide professional opportunities for MSW students in a variety of sectors and settings.</p>
<p>III. Engage in faculty research, scholarship, and service that will advance theory, policy, and practice in the profession of social work and in the field of social welfare more generally.</p>
<p>IV. Provide faculty expertise and leadership toward resolving multiple urban problems particularly in relation to the Greater Boston Metropolitan area and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts_3b76.html" title="Commonwealth of Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>V. Provide lifelong learning opportunities for <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_workers.html" title="Social workers">social workers</a> and other helping professionals, particularly those in public and private nonprofit agencies."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_School_of_Social_Work_7661.html" title="Edit section: Programs of Study">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Programs of Study</span></h2>
<p>BU SSW offers full and part-time programs leading to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Social_Work_6554.html" title="Master of Social Work">Master of Social Work</a> degree, with concentrations in Clinical and Macro Social Work Practice. Advanced Standing programs are also available.</p>
<p><br />
The full-time study program includes two years of full-time study in residence. There are several part-time study programmes. Typically part-time students fulfill the degree requirements in either three or four years. Part-time students can attend the Charles River campus, or attend one of the two off-campus programmes. The off-campus, part-time program in Northeastern Massachusetts is located in <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyngsboro%2C_Massachusetts_92a4.html" title="Tyngsboro, Massachusetts">Tyngsboro, Massachusetts</a>. The off-campus, part-time program in Southeastern Massachusetts, is located in <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_River%2C_Massachusetts_6440.html" title="Fall River, Massachusetts">Fall River, Massachusetts</a> and on <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_3538.html" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a>. The Macro Social Work concentration is only available at the Charles River campus. The off-campus sites and the Charles River campus offer the Clinical Social Work program of study.</p>
<p>The Schoolâ€™s curriculum emphasizes a broad approach to social and personal problems and the differential use of social work methods. During the first year of graduate study, the student is introduced to social work knowledge, values, and practice areas through a series of foundation courses.</p>
<p>Subsequently, students take advanced coursework to develop and deepen their competence according to their special interests and talents, and specialize in a method of social work: Clinical Social Work Practice (with individuals, families, and groups), or Macro Social Work Practice (community organization, management, and planning). In the last semester, students are required to take a social work practice ethics course.</p>
<p><br />
BU SSW offers several Dual Degree programs in cooperation with other BU graduate schools and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Sociology and Social Work.</p>

<p>The School had its beginnings in the School of Education and was later called the School of Religious and Social Work.</p>
<p>In 1937 the Division of Social Work inaugurated a two-year graduate program. In 1939 it was accredited provisionally as a school of social work, and in 1940 became a separate entity as the School of Social Work. Since 1942 it has offered only the graduate program, and since 1943 it has had full accreditation as a school of social work.</p>
<p>The southeastern Massachusetts (SEMA) and northeastern Massachusetts (NEMA) off-campus programs were established in 1982 and 1985, respectively. An additional SEMA site on Cape Cod (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnstable%2C_Massachusetts_163d.html" title="Barnstable, Massachusetts">Barnstable, Massachusetts</a>) was established in 2002. These programs provide students who live a distance from Boston the opportunity to pursue a Master of Social Work degree in a part-time, weekend format.</p>
