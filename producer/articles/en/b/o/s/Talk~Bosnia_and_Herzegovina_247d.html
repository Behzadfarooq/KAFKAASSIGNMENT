<p>There is a continuity with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (March 1 1992-December 15 1995). However, officially the Republic doesn't exist, and ought to be given its own historical entry. This is contained in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (set out in Annex 4 of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Framework_Agreement_for_Peace_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_4ff4.html" title="General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina">General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>): liable sources on this planet. I mean come on, it's a spy organization =).</p>
<p>In addition, I hear "republicka bosna i hercegovina" every single time before the country's name is cited on Bosnian news. Mehicdino 22:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<dd>I hope your are able to read. And the further discussion about this seems futile.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The CIA factbook says the following:</p>
<p>conventional long form: none conventional short form: 'Bosnia and Herzegovina' local long form: none local short form: Bosna i Hercegovina former: People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
<p>So I don't see a reason for your constant reverts to information that is wrong. You can call it an "emerging federal democratic republic", but its federalization is being strongly opposed to by the Bosniak politicians (federal Bosnia is the agenda of Milorad Dodik, the RS prime minister). This is why I opted for the neutral variant of "parliamentary democracy", while people can go to Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina to go into further detail on the political system. In essence, I have nothing against calling it a republic as a description of its political system, I have a problem with "emerging federal", because it means nothing -- to emerge is such a vague term, that I don't think it's suitable for an encyclopedic entry, while "federal" is just not true (yet).</p>
<p>--OgiDog</p>
<p>Also, in Bosnian, Serbian or Croatian it is "republika". "Republicka" is an adjective. You didn't seem to have been listening carefully to the news.</p>
<p>Please stop vandalizing the pages for once!!!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ogidog, please educate yourself more in what you say as I won't even begin to counter your complete fantasy entry there such as saying that the Bosniak politicians of the country are opposing a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, as they are doing just the opposite of what you say. Also, parliamentary democracy is fine as the government type of this country on Wikipedia, as "emerging federal democratic republic" is just even more specific then "parliamentary democracy". And finally, whoever made the dumb claim that "republicka" is an adjective you too educate yourself. I speak Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian and if I say "Ova zemlja je republicka" that would mean "This country is a republic". Mehicdino 23:40, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
In Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian -- "Ova zemlja je REPUBLIKA" is "This country is a republic" (not "republicka"). Furthermore, "republička vlada" means "the government of the republic" of "the republican government" (the adjective or "pridjev" in Serbian/Bosnian/Croatian). Other actual speakers of the language will confirm this. If you read what I said, also, which I presume you didn't, I just stated that the Bosniak politicians oppose the "federal" Bosnia, not the democracy. I will stop arguing with you as of this moment, as you make zero sense. Please stop vandalizing the page. --OgiDog</p>
<p><br />
My bad Ogidog, I typoed. "republika" is noun for republic and "republička" is verb for republican. Oh and I am aware of your edit of your past entry, before the edit it clearly said that the Bosniak politicians are opposing a democracy, you just changed it now. And finally, I'm not vandalizing the page. If you go on dictionary.com and enter "vandalism" it will say deliberate malicious destruction of something. Regardless if I was right or not, if I thought I was truly right and kept reverting something it wouldn't be vandalism, yet just plain ignorance. Oh and sign your name with four tildes (the key right above left tab and left of #1. ), not with "--Ogidog". Mehicdino 22:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Well, you had more than one "typo". Also please show me the version of this page where I accuse the Bosniak lot of being against democracy. This is ridiculous. -- Ogidog</p>

<p>There were attempts to coin words before. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. I'm cracking up from these idle ludicrous suggestions. RS is actually untranslatable -- the international policy is to use "Republika Srpska", not the Republic of Srpska. As it is in modern Serbo-Croat, in English too, the correct term is actually Republika Srpska, in it's Serbo-Croat form, this in part is because RS is not a Republic, it's an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina (which is not a "state" either, which makes the matter even funnier, a non-republic called republic inside a state which is only referred to as the state in the official name of its border service and nowhere else! -- welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina!!!).

<p>Does anyone know why Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina stopped using the name "Bosnia-Herzegovina"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because it never used it. It has always been Bosnia AND Herzegovina, and has always been representing itself as such. The real question is why it actually ever became hyphenated&#160;:). --Ogidog</dd>

<dd>Bosnia-Herzegovina isn't much different from Bosnia and Herzegovina, it's just a hyphen. However in sports such as soccer you'll see the country still as "Bosnia-Herzegovina" because on game tables and team names etc, there is no "and". Mehicdino 01:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the name of the country and never was in Serbo-Croat. Simply because Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Pierre et Miquelon are all called with their "ands". And pertains to two geographical regions that make up the country. The hyphen doesn't make sense. It is probably an old mistake that persisted.</dd>

<dd>It is similar to the actual translation of the name "Bosna" which was erroneously taken over as "Bosnia" in the recent centuries as a (flawed) analogy to "Serbia", "Romania" or "Bulgaria" (or their French or German versions). The difference is that the respective original names have the i(j)a ending, denoting a noun that names a region or a country, while ther area of "Bosna" was named after the Bosna river (most likely) which was very common in the area (there are still (albeit smaller) areas of Bosnia called Usora or Vrbas from the olden times, rather than Usoria or Vrbasia, and these rivers still run). It appears that if areas were named after rivers, the didn't get the -ia ending. --Ogidog</dd>

<p>You have said "using the previous precedents such as the word "hrvatska" (which means both "Hrvatska" - Croatia and "hrvatska" - Croatian as an adjective, f.), the word Srpska was also declared to be a proper noun". There is no precedent with the word "hrvatska". In Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian language almost every name of the state is both noun and adjective - Bugarska (Bulgaria), Madjarska (Hungary), Grcka (Greece), Njemacka (Germany), Francuska (France), Engleska (England), etc. So, the noun "Srpska" was not declared to be a noun. The noun Srpska, as the name of the state, the republic or the entity is completely based on language rules and the spirit of Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian language.</p>
<p>I propose that you either delete this part (from the words "because the word" to the words "declared to be a proper noun", or to explain the creation of names of states in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian language.</p>
<p>Stevo</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that there is no precedent, nor any declaration of the word to be a noun!!! That's ridiculous. Nouns such as country names that have adjective pairs such as the ones you listed above (or the Serbo-Croat , including the novel one "Srpska" are actually what Serbo-Croat grammarians call "poimeničeni prid(j)evi" or, in English, <i>nominalized</i> adjectives. I think it is just a case of poor English in "declared to be a proper noun", which often pops up in these entries that are often only interesting to people they concern directly, so there are few edits from native speakers! --Ogidog</dd>

<p>It was shown by the Croat historian I. Goldstein that Tomoslav and Kresimir IV never ruled Bosnia (Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, p. 286-291) For that matter, the Croat historian N. Klaic pointed out that their rule never extended beyond the river Una (N. Klaic, Prilog IX).</p>
<dl>
<dd>My, my, my....they would like to do some history revisionism &amp; they cant even spell the names properly. OK, time for reality check:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Ivo Goldstein is not generally accepted as *the* authority on Croatian medieval period. His book on Croatian medieval history, «Hrvatski rani srednji vijek» is still a textbook on Croatian medievalistics only due to the fact that he taught the subject for some time (he is now teaching Croatian contemporary history- and his position is precarious since his credentials are weak: he was appointed to the chair mostly due to machinations of political cliques of pro-Yugoslav &amp; Communist affiliation still dominant in parts of Croatian academic life). Nevertheless, his stature as authority in Croatian medieval history is not very strong: the dominant tone is set by academicians Tomislav Raukar and Radoslav Katičić, as well as younger historians like Mladen Ančić, Milko Brković etc. But, let's see Goldstein's work for a while: on page 286. Goldstein dismissed the reports of Tomislav's reign in Bosnia- without a slightest argument. He enumerated a few sources that claimed Tomislav had ruled in Bosnia and simply stated he didn't believe them. That's not a «proof» of anything, but an ex-cathedra pronouncement with no basis whatsoever. Another thing is his «contribution» on the page 308. There he quotes LJPD/Chronicle of the priest of Dioclea: «Krešimir zauze čitavu Bosnu i zavlada njom»/Krešimir conquered all of Bosnia and ruled it. Goldstein, this time, did not dismiss the report- but has hastened to add that Krešimir's rule had been-it must had been- short. These passages (and much, much more) show that Ivo Goldstein is not a serious historian: he's got political agenda (mostly in denigrating Croatian heritage) and his works in history have not achieved the status of respectable academic books. For a review in Croatian, this is a recap:<a href="http://www.hic.hr/dom/393/dom10.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hic.hr/dom/393/dom10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hic.hr/dom/393/dom10.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>much more serious is academician Tomislav Raukar (<a href="http://www.hazu.hr/Akademici/TRaukar.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hazu.hr/Akademici/TRaukar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hazu.hr/Akademici/TRaukar.html</a>), whose «Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje», 1998, is considered a landmark in Croatian medievalistics. For a review on the site of the Sarajevo Instite of history, see:<a href="http://www.iis.unsa.ba/prilozi/30/30_prikazi_hrvatsko.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.iis.unsa.ba/prilozi/30/30_prikazi_hrvatsko.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iis.unsa.ba/prilozi/30/30_prikazi_hrvatsko.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On pages 116-129 the growth of Croatian medieval state is chartered. Page 118 is on Tomislav's state, and the eastern border is, roughly, on the river Bosna-river Neretva line. True, the core Bosnia (the contemporary Sarajevo region) lies outside it- but it doesn't matter, since this area was virtually depopulated. As regards contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tomislav ruled over ca. 65% of its territory. The next page shows further expansion which even crossed the Drina river and incorporated Bosnia proper (Sarajevo and Tuzla regions), while Krešimir's rule is supposed to be again on the Bosna-Neretva line, just a bit more eastwards. The author has acknowledged that there were no methods to ascertain the exact position of eastern Croatian border.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>moreover- Serbian historian Relja Novaković has «given» Croats even more territory in Bosnia:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>«..U prvoj polovini X veka do 30ih godina, politička granica Hrvatske prema istoku dopirala je po svoj prilici do planinskog venca koji čine planine Zelengora, Lelija, Treskavica, Jahorina, Romanija, Ozren i Zvijezda.»/In the first half of the 10th century, until the 30ies, Croatian political border to the east was, probably, the mountainous wreath composed of the mountains Zelengora, Lelija, Treskavica, Jahorina, Romanija, Ozren and Zvijezda».</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Relja Novaković: O nekim pitanjima granica Srbije, Hrvatske i Bosne u X veku, Zbornik Fil.fak. u Beogradu, VII/1, 1963, str. 178/On some questions regarding the Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia borders in the 10th century, Philosophical faculty in Belgrade, 1963.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well- this is ca. 80-90% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. *So, let's recapitulate:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the most authoritative texts on Croatian medieval history (Tomislav Raukar, Mladen Ančić,..) put Croatian rule in Bosnia in the 10th century to covering to not less than 60-70% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, and probably more</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Goldstein is not the authority, while his mentor Nada Klaić is superseded by more contemporary scholarship (also, her «borders credibility» is not very strong- she also claimed, until her death, that Croats arrived to Croatia from Carantania/Slovenia- a quirky idea dismissed by virtually everyone)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>some other historians (Croatian Antoljak, Serbian Novaković etc.) consider that Croatian borders in the 10th century covered more than 80-90% of the current BiH.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So, it's somewhere between 65% and 85% of B &amp; H. I guess it's more than enough for a revert. And, as far as historical sources are concerned- this is also more than enough:<a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_1c9e.html#Coup_de_grace" title="Talk:History of Bosnia and Herzegovina">Talk:History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina#Coup_de_grace</a> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 19:26, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Several users have already noticed that the history section appears too long (see above notes by Jiang, Efghij and Shallot).</p>
<p>Given that suggestion, moving non-essential text to the separate <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_5483.html" title="History of Bosnia and Herzegovina">History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> page is a good idea. That way, only the essential and most informative parts would remain on the main country entry for <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> as a whole, while those interested in the history will surely read more details on the history page.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I've tried to shorten the text of the Pre-Slavic period. Furthermore, it is probably not very useful to introduce many "tribe" names as the first thing that people will read on the history section. What's needed is a brief and informative overview without too many dates and names, some of which remain open to dispute because evidence for definitive claims about this period remains scarce. --Kelime</p>

<dd>Indeed. A region of the country is identified as "Herzegovina", but borders do not exist. In fact, the only reason the title of the country is Bosnia and Herzegovina and not just Bosnia is because the citiziens of historical and cultural Herzegovina want to be known.

<p>Nikola, what evidence do you have to <b>not</b> include the not-too-religious people of Bosnian Muslim extraction among the Yugoslavs?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's hard to proove a negative thing. I haven't found any useful reference when googling for "bosniaks yugoslavs" (also in native language). <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I can certainly see how they could comprise at least a minor part of the Yugoslav demographic (which is why they're added last in that list, after mixed marriage people and hardcore patriots). For someone whose parents were Serbs or Croats, they could register as their nationality without the implication that they're Orthodox or Catholic, but the people born to a couple of "Muslims by nationality" simply couldn't.</p>
<dl>
<dd>They have surely comprised a part, but then so did everyone else. I don't see why would registering as a "Muslim <b>by nationality</b>" implicate someone's religion. In Serbia, it is often suggested that most Yugoslavs were Serbs, being the most devout to the Yugoslav idea. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Um, AFAIK it wasn't actually literally "Muslim by nationality" in Yugoslav censa, one just registered as "Musliman" when asked about nationality. This is a clear implication in my book. Serbia (and any other republic, really) is not too comparable, they have a different, much more homogenous and long-nationally-established primary demographic. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a></dd>

<dd>Of course they did, but it stands to reason that the largest group emigrated the most, and also the one that was quite endangered — for many months in the war, the Bosniaks were completely surrounded both by hostile forces of the Serbs and of the Croats, they sure didn't have it easy (whereas most areas held by the other two nations at least had a link to the two nearby countries). --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 21:44, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The claim that the Brcko District is not part of either the Federation or Republika Srpska might de facto be true (that is how things are run on the ground), but de iure it is false. If the Brcko District is not part of either entity, this would imply that the District is in fact the <i>third</i> entity. This would be a major breach of the general framework of the Dayton peace agreement (and the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina), which states that the country is internally composed of only two entities. Also, the Brcko District as 'not part of either entity' would make the territorial formula agreed at Dayton (49% of Bosnia-Herzegovina as Republika Srpska, 51% as the Federation) unworkable. OHR, Office of the High Representative (<a href="http://www.ohr.int" class="external free" title="http://www.ohr.int" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohr.int</a>), provided a clarification on the status of the Brcko District, stating that the District is in fact a <b>condominium</b> of both entities. This means that the territory of the District is shared by both entities, although the entities exercise no executive power there. In other words, the Brcko District territory is <i>both</i> Republika Srpska and the Federation. Technically, this would apply to the whole territory of the District - in that way, there is no third entity, and 49-51% formula is (somehow) preserved. That said, it should be pointed out that the Brcko District was proclaimed on the whole territory of the prewar Brcko municipality. According to the Dayton map, 42% of the prewar Brcko municipality (including the town of Brcko) ended up in the Republika Srpska, while 58% of the prewar Brcko municipality ended up in the Federation. Although the Brcko District was proclaimed in 1999, IEBL (Inter Entity Boundary Line) within its territory was never officially abolished; IEBL plays no administrative function within the District, except to mark the line beyond which the Bosnian Serb Army (Vojska Republike Srpske) traveling through the District can not go (and vice versa for the Federation Army). Thus, it remains unclear how the entities hold the condominium over the whole District if the IEBL still exists on the books, and the District was created out of uneven chunks of both entity's territory. Given the fact that the Republika Srpska never officially accepted the arbitration result (one of the reasons IEBL was never officially abolished), the only solution is to show the Republika Srpska territory within the Brcko District (42% of it) on the Republika Srpska entity map, but color it differently, and the same formula should be used vis-à-vis the Federation territory within the Brcko District (58% of it) on the Federation entity map. When you put all of this together, you have a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina showing only two entities but also acknowledging the existence of the Brcko District - the neutral position.</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p>The 'condominium' idea or the Brcko District is demonstrated by the way in which people declare themselves within the District.

<p><b>Bosnia not formal protectorate</b> Even if there are different sources that says that, Bosnia is not formally an international protectorate. Kosovo is because of Resolution no. 1244 of the UN Security Council stated it, but Bosnia, meaning Bosnia i Hercegovina (BiH) is not formally like that. It's wrong writing that it is. Just check the dayton agreement on www.ohr.int, you won't find anything. There lots of authors that says BiH is a protectorate (see Chandler David, Faking Democracy after Dayton, Bose Sumantra, G.Knaus Travails on the European Raj), and I do agree too, but formally BiH is a member of the Council of Europe and it has a chair at United Nation, which a protectorate, like Kosovo, doesn't.

<p>Dear Serbs and Croats,</p>
<p>It is an strange event to have an encyclopedia written by "anyone" who wants.</p>
<p>It is also strange to have history that does not comply in its esence with anything written so far. There is some admin Maru who relate himself with Catolic Church in this way or the other. It would not be bad to look at encyclopedia catolica for that gentlmen and realize the notorious lies on the page on History of Bosnia and Herzegovina, plus to ralize the idiotizam in people who say that they speak Bosniak but understand Croatian and partiali understand Serbian when difference between this so called lanuages is similar to difference in English spoken in London against the one in New York and the one in Livrerpool. However he blocked my abalility to just take a text from any outstanding world resource and correct this PROPAGANDA presented as a history.</p>
<p>It is the moment when people and ceratin nations after period of genocides and devastations should live with a "new world order" where history can be changed, when propaganda is superponing the facts and CNN the thousends of years of civilization in Europe. It is a time when I can be foreigner in a land of my grandfathers, my name changed, my roots, even my future, and this autorized by internet autority like he is.</p>
<p>It is a time when after 500 years of rule of Ottoman empire with so many genocides, persecutions, sufferings and killing of all people on the Balkan we need to live as a foreigners in our on land being classified as bosnians, having a "governor" with absolute power who came to change our names and our past and to shape our future-dezaster. To put us in a rezervoats of the past, or Bosnian Sandzak. The man who is "supposed" to "invent" a new nations, like Europe is no man land which is inhabitted by bunch of someones that need to be indentified</p>
<p>There is bunch of books of historians throughout a Europe and USA. There is clear agreemnet among them, among the facts of the past that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a land inhabitted by same substance that today makes Serbian and Croation people, that there is the thin line between them too. There is not better proof but the language spoken. Howere against any common sense it is this, so called ecyclopedia, where new languages will be invented and new nations established. It will be here where Croations and Serbs will be erased from the past of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where what Ottomans started will be continued.</p>
<p>And it will be here where we will be put in arena to fight to prove obvious to someone who has no mayor title but being apointed by someone to curve the history of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore this is another populistic measure of destroying the system of values build by Europe and given to the world. It will be the CROWED of us who will fight to prove proven giving in this way power to "judges of true" to sell it on the market, as CNN todays cells the "trusted news" to those who are willing to "push" more for their "truth"</p>
<p>By allowing this you are allowing the genocide, cultural and civilizational of Croatian and Serbian people. You are erasing their past and their future. They are, against every available document, becomaning nothing more but ortodox and catolic bosnians in the land where clear historical events show something quite oposite. Will for you Indians become Pakistanies of Hindu religion.</p>
<p>By participating in this way of creating the history you are crossing the thin line between making sience the mean of propaganda war</p>

Why does it need to be shorter. It is probably as long as, for example, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> while it is equally if not more complex.

<p>Readers could benifit from an informative and grammatically coherent economy section. At the moment I don't think current section fulfills these purposes. I can fix grammatical errors, but I cannot give the first two paragraphs any purpose. I hope to expand on Agriculture, Mining, manufacturing and forestry.

<p>The "current" map in the Demographics section leads me to think that all municipalities are ethnically homogenious, which is certainly not the case. A map up to the same quality as the 1991 map would hopefully remind readers that BiH is somewhat still ethnically heterogenious.--<a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLittle_be80.html" title="User:MLittle">M Little</a> 12:47, 29 July 2006 (UTC)MLittle</p>

<dd>KAMENICA, Bosnia, Aug. 17 -- The bodies of more than 1,000 victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre have been exhumed from the largest mass grave found to date in Bosnia, forensic experts said Thursday.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Experts began digging in June 2006 near the eastern Bosnian village of Kamenica, close to the border with Serbia, where they have found eight mass graves. The team has exhumed 144 complete and 1,009 partial skeletons.</dd>

<p>It is interesting how Serbs promoted invented word "Serbophobia" on the internet. First they introduced the word to wikipedia, and then thousands of other scrapper sites copied content from wikipedia, and now Google yields thousands of matches for this invented word. Of course, while Bosniaks wanted to do the same, and create an article Bosniakophobia, Serbs quickly jumped and voted "NO!". And of course, attempts to create Bosniakophobia article failed thanks to Serbian activism on wikipedia! They don't use wikipedia for educational, but for their nationalistic/politic purposes. It is sickening to see Serbian propaganda and lies poisoning Wikipedia. What we Bosniaks need to do is focus more on <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a> article which is under attack by pro-Serbian vandals and revisionists/deniers on a daily basis. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 07:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know this article's mainly about Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II, all of Bosnia was ceded to the Independent State of Croatia. The Nazi rule over Bosnia led to widespread persecution of Jewish, Serbian and Gypsy civilians. The Jewish population was nearly exterminated and roughly <b>750,000 Serbs died</b> as a result of genocide perpetrated by the Croatian Ustasha. Many Serbs in the area took up arms and joined the Chetniks; <b>a Serb nationalist and royalist resistance movement</b> that conducted guerrilla warfare against the Nazis but then switched sides and joined them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p>How many times do i read debates amongst the Serbs, (their supporters) and Croats in regards to the WWII democidal death toll in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, as well as the role of the Chetniks? Is this paragraph supposed to be NPOV according to Wiki standards? Sounds like Serb propaganda to me, and i don't think that any propagandizing of any sort from any side is suppose to be encyclopaedic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The numbers are disputed, but shoudlnt be to hard to find what historians say, if you cant I suggest you enter "hundreds of thousands".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Should I cite the scholarly and academic research Vladmiir Zerjavic (a Croat), and Bogoljub Kocovic (a Serb)? Otherwise "hundreds of thousands" is far too vague.</p>
<p>And yes Chetniks where nationalists and royalists mostly composited of serbs. <a href="../../../f/o/a/User%7EFoant_a5c9.html" title="User:Foant">Foant</a></p>
<p>Goosh, you really are useless? I know too well what the Chetnik movement stood for. I thought that i would attract replies from someone more knowledgable about WWII Yugoslavia than you. Aren't you aware that Draza had little, to no control over other Chetnik factions led by Pop Momcilo Djuic, Kosta Pecanac and Dmitrie Ljotic plus those factions collaborated to different extend to the others, even those who partaked in actions against the Axis occupiers?</p>

<dd>This is my solution. I propose that some (most) of the images from the gallery be integrated into the article. It is nonsense leaving them in the gallery when they are of good use to the article itself. I mean, look at the article, 95% of the images are MAPS!!! It is nonsense, there needs to be an addition of images directly into the article. Look at other countries, most of them aim at showing the beauty of that specific country through pictures/photographs. This article needs some work (physically).

<dd>Yeah I agree with you that a lot of them would be better place throughout the article, rather than in a huge gallery at the end. But still, I don't think it would hurt to remove completely about half of the images in the article - although they could be well suited to other articles, e.g since <a href="../../../w/a/t/Image%7EWaterfall_in_Jajce_Bosnia.JPG_5883.html" title="Image:Waterfall in Jajce Bosnia.JPG">Image:Waterfall_in_Jajce_Bosnia.JPG</a> is already in the <a href="../../../j/a/j/Jajce.html" title="Jajce">Jajce</a> article it could probably be removed from this one. <font style="background:none" size="3">—<a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvan_Kricancic_d72f.html" title="User:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkblue" face="Vivaldi">King</font></a><a href="../../../i/v/a/User_talk%7EIvan_Kricancic_1dc4.html" title="User talk:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkred" face="Times New Roman"><b>Ivan</b></font></a></font> 06:41, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
