<p>Hello <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a>. Before we jump into the disputes themselves, I would like to deal with some preliminary issues. You had agreed <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESathya_Sai_Baba_317d.html#Dispute_resolution" title="Talk:Sathya Sai Baba">Talk:Sathya Sai Baba#Dispute resolution</a> to mediation on a prior occasion. Please understand, however, that I am not an official mediator, just a volunteer. Under these circumstances, I would very much like you to express whether or not you are willing to have me as a mediator. (Please do so in the top section above). There are some other issues that I would like to discuss right at the start.</p>
<p>Prior to your original agreement to mediation, you raised concern that the process should be binding. I have no power of enforcement. I can however, make proposals that all parties abide by certain procedures. Agreement to these proposals would be voluntary, and it would be the right of wikipedians to treat such agreements as outside of normal Wikipedia jurisdiction. However, such agreements may have a moral authority, even if not an official one.</p>
<p>So, please consider whether you would agree to have me play the role of mediator, and indicate your agreement/disagreement above. Thanks --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 13:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have two concerns that may be resolved together
<ol>
<li>BostonMA's relative inexperience with Wikipedia. S/he started editing Wikipedia in December 2005. Is that correct?</li>
<li>If the mediation is going to be informally binding then it would be good to complete some work first on the article. I want to add information from the book by Brian Steel about SSB (including the assertion that he now refutes some of his writings on his homepage) and the LIMF book. I think it would be better to include this information first before starting the mediation and included possible disputes about it in the mediation. I guess nobody wants to start a new major dispute a month after the mediation has ended. (Yes, I should have said this when I agree with mediation, but I did not think of it then)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>My proposal is to wait until information from these books has been added to the article and in the meantime BostonMA can become more experienced with Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:37, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Andries. Regarding your question: I obtained a user account in December, and although technically I have made anonymous edits for some time prior, you are welcome to date my involvement with Wikipedia from that time.</dd>
<dd>With regard to your proposal: I think we may have different ideas regarding mediation. As I see it, mediation is not arbitration. If you should accept me as a mediator, that does not mean that I will play the role of handing out decisions, and expecting you to abide by them. Rather, I will be aiming to clarify issues and facilitate the coming to agreement by the parties themselves. I would ask questions to which I hope the answers would help this process and I would share my opinions and my experiences. However, I would <strong>not</strong> decide the content of the article (or articles) in question, and I would not tell you what to do.</dd>
<dd>You are quite within your rights to not accept me as a mediator, or to propose that I only act as a mediator at some point in the future. However, I don't see the need for postponing mediation until after you have made your expected edits. Since the purpose of mediation is to help the parties come to an agreement, my inclination is to not favor postponement. With that in mind, I offer a counter proposal: accept me as a mediator on a trial basis, say for two weeks. If at the end of two weeks, you are unhappy with my involvement, I will remove myself from the dispute, and no-one should hold it against you that you were not satisfied. I am neither a long time editor, nor do I have any official status, and thus, no-one ought to be penalized for accepting me as a mediator on a trial basis, but rejecting me as a mediator when the trial is over. So that is my offer. Please give it some thought. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 22:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I accept BostonMA's counter proposal. Though BostonMA is inexperienced, his discussion with a veteran contributor to Wikipedia, <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">user:172</a>, shows that he is reasonable and fair. I hope that BostonMA's is wise enough never to reveal his real name, because the history of the disputes between apologists and critics of SSB shows that he may be victim of defamation and ad hominem attacks. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:06, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the mediator's opinion, the conflicts that occurred on the SSB and related pages prior to the start of mediation had a highly repetative character. The same or similar points would be raised again and again. Part of the reason why mediation seemed to become necessary is that the repetition of arguments seemed to have little or no effect toward resolving the conflicts. For this reason, the mediator has attempted to focus on a few issues until they are resolved, rather than to leave off a discussion whenever a new issue arose. For that reason, there is somewhat of a gap between the questions the mediator has raised, and the immediately disputed edit conflicts. The mediator does not want to discourage the parties from debating issues outside of those he has raised as formal questions. Nor does the mediator want to address every edit conflict immediately when it occurs. However, it has been argued that a "new" edit falls outside the scope of the current mediation. The mediator disagrees, and believes that the new edit conflicts are continuations of existing edit conflicts. Because the mediator has not focused on these questions, parties should not be accused of abandoning mediation merely on the grounds that discussion of edits is taking place on the talk pages of the article rather than on mediation pages. However, the mediator does not want to set a precedent in which parties believe that the mediator should not raise questions pertaining to certain edits on the grounds that these edits are "out of scope".</p>
<p>Please express your agreement or disagreement with this opinion of the mediator. Please discuss other issues elsewhere. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 20:55, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Andries: The mediator can mediate any dispute, but I think mediation makes only sense in grey areas, for example somewhat doubtful sources or the structure of the article i.e. in cases in which the policies are open for different interpretations. Mediation does not make sense when there can be reasonably no differing interpretations of policies, such as when a reputable source, like <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">salon.com</a> supports the inclusion of a certain statement or opinion, like accusations of sexual abuse of "boys". If the mediator wants to mediate disputes for which different interpretations of policies are not reasonably possible then I will not object strongly, though think this may be a waste of time for all, but especially for the mediator. I do hope that black-and-white disputes can be dealt with quickly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>One of the main editors for the SSB Wikipedia article is Andries. He is also the webmaster to the <b>largest</b> Anti-SSB Site on the internet, opposing SSB: <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/belowframe.html" class="external text" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/belowframe.html" rel="nofollow">hetnet.nl/~exbaba</a> It is important to point out that Andries now claims, after a three year period, he is <b>not</b> the webmaster for the site. However, there is plenty of evidence to refute this claim: <a href="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/wikipedia/wikipedia-andries-webmaster.html" class="external text" title="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/wikipedia/wikipedia-andries-webmaster.html" rel="nofollow">Reference</a> As a matter of fact, Andries is now listing his position, on the hetnet.nl/~exbaba site, as being the <b>"Main Representative, Supervisor and Contact"</b>. Therefore, his direct involvement, with the <b>largest</b> Anti-SSB site on the world wide web, is indisputable.</p>
<p>Andries has referenced the personal homepages of various Anti-SSB activists for over <b>two years</b> on the Main SSB article and about 14 months on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" rel="nofollow">Allegations Against Sathya Sai Baba</a> article. Andries never complained about personal homepages until my homepage was cited on the Main SSB article. Now Andries claims that personal homepages violate Wikipedia's guidelines. I have NO problem removing my name and webpages from the article. However, Andries is linking the references directly to Anti-SSB sites (including his own) in an attempt to promote his POV.</p>
<p>It is my contention that these actions do not promote a NPOV because the references (which were <b>never</b> originally published on Anti-Sai Sites) are linked to sites that specifically <b>oppose</b> Sathya Sai Baba. Therefore, I have insisted (to maintain fairness) that as long as Andries Anti-Sai Site is referenced, my Pro-Sai Site should be referenced as well. I have also asked that the references either be linked directly to their original sources or not linked at all (giving un-linked reference information instead).</p>
<p>Thaumaturgic originally submitted one paragraph to the Main SSB article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=29756595&amp;oldid=29513141" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=29756595&amp;oldid=29513141" rel="nofollow">Reference 2</a> Andries kept deleting this article and modifying it, attempting to undermine it. Then Andries started attributing the viewpoints to me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=29902403&amp;oldid=29900875" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=29902403&amp;oldid=29900875" rel="nofollow">Reference 3</a> After attributing the viewpoints to me, Andries claimed I am "non-notable" and repeatedly attempted to delete the entire Devotees and Proponents section. It is important to point out that the one paragraph was/is <b>not</b> dependent on me or my views. The paragraph contained statements of fact that sum up the Devotees and Proponents POV. It is also my contention that Andries is guilty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:POV_pushing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:POV_pushing" rel="nofollow">POV Pushing</a>. He is willing to go to great lengths to add anything negative to the article but consistently waters down, modifies or deletes any positive material.</p>
<p>One example (out of many) is when Andries cited LIMF (The unofficial biography of SSB, <i>Love Is My Form</i>) as a "reputable" reference to support opposing information against SSB. After stating LIMF is "reputable", Andries completely disregards LIMF when it comes to Pro-Sai material in the book.</p>
<p>I am not the only person to have problems with Andries. There are many other editors who have had numerous problems with him. For example, you can view the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guru" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guru" rel="nofollow">Guru Talk Page</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Prem_Rawat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Prem_Rawat" rel="nofollow">Prem Rawat Talk Page</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest that a couple of paragraphs be added to the Main SSB page that fairly and neutrally summarizes the SSB Controversy. Then I ask that the NPOV be enforced with other SSB related articles, including the "Allegations Against Sathya Sai Baba" article.</p>
<p>I would like to make it clear that I am not seeking to eliminate or suppress the Anti-SSB POV. You can verify this from my edits. At no time have I ever deleted the Anti-SSB POV or modified it in any significant way.</p>
<p>Thank you for volunteering to moderate. I am optimistic that only good can come from this and I look forward to working together with you to make the SSB Wikipedia Articles neutral, fair and balanced.</p>

<p>BostonMA, I would also like to thank you for volunteering to mediate. If you do not mind, I would rather watch the discussion and add occasional comments. I do not want Andries to feel that he is being ganged up upon by SSS108 and me. SSS108 is much more familiar with the material in question than I. This Wikipedia article is prejudiced and is promoting an antagonistic point of view, against Sathya Sai Baba. Andries is the person who is responsible for this bias. Any information added to the article must first pass <b>his</b> inspection, approval and edits. This is unfair and should not be allowed. Andries is openly antagonistic towards Sathya Sai Baba and maintains a high-ranking position on the Exbaba site. You can view the discussion I started when I added the Devotees and Proponents section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#A_Section_For_Devotees_And_Proponents" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba/archive2#A_Section_For_Devotees_And_Proponents" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Like SSS108, I have not sought to eliminate the antagonistic point of view. With SSS108's help, I simply sought to include a Devotees and Proponents point of view. Who knew that one paragraph could evince such hostility? The problems with this article far exceeds the addition of a Devotees and Proponents point of view. I am committed to a neutral point of view and would like my voice counted as one, among many, opposing the bias in this article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 16:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What I expect for this article and from mediation<br />
1. Same standards for allowing sources and reference: if critics can only use peer reviewed articles and articles from reputable magazines and newspapers then apologists' material must follow the same standards. So I suggest setting a standard for inclusion and exclusion first. If apologists (like Moreno) can quote themselves from their non-notable homepages that contradict reputable sources, like the BBC and the Free university of Amsterdam then I (and other critics) can quote myself too from my non notable homepage that contradict reputable sources. The website www.exbaba.com, though I am affiliated with the website, is not my homepage: it is the homepage of the concerned Dutch former followers of SSB of which I am a member. Only a very small fraction of the website was authored by me. The only articles that were authored by me are my testimony “calumny confirmed”, a short translation and short comment about a SSB school in the Netherlands, my small outdated essay about “brainwashing” (that was first published on a yahoo group and then on <a href="http://www.surrealist.org/betrayalofthespirit/index.html#cultsgeneral" class="external free" title="http://www.surrealist.org/betrayalofthespirit/index.html#cultsgeneral" rel="nofollow">http://www.surrealist.org/betrayalofthespirit/index.html#cultsgeneral</a> and only then on exbaba) and the compilation of the recovery section on exbaba. Exbaba has never been the website on which I can de jure or de facto voice my opinions, unlike the website of Gerald Joe Moreno/SSS108 and I have limited influence over its contents.<br />
2. Clearly identified violations of Wikipedia policies should either be removed or improved within a week. We should not wait with improving or removing until “the other side” has followed all of Wikipedia policies and guidelines.<br />
3. Main organization of the article should by subject or chronological, not per POV. We should not discuss Jens Sethi, or affidavits in two or three different places.<br />
4. The discussion and space dedicated to criticism in this article should reflect the criticism in both mainstream media articles and scholarly articles since David Bailey’s publication of “The Findings” in the year 2000 that was a major turning point in the debates about SSB.<br />
5. Facts and government actions should precede the opinions and internet wars between critics and apologists. The first clearly have more encyclopedic value.</p>
<p>With regards to my behavior in the past that involved using the homepages of Robert Priddy and Brian Steel as sources that may have violated the Wikipedia a bit I would like to say the following. Both Priddy and Steel have published books about SSB that could have been used as a source for this article. Using their outdated books as a source while not allowing their current homepages in which they refute their previous writings may break the Wikipedia policies literally, but clearly contradicts common sense and the Wikipedia policies do not treat such an exceptional case. Apart from that, Steel and Priddy have been favorably cited as a source by Alexandra Nagel who wrote an article published by the Free University of Amsterdam in 1994 about SSB. Thirdly, most of Priddy’s online work has been published in book from by <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basava_Premanand_aa9a.html" title="Basava Premanand">Basava Premanand</a> who is treated as an expert by the BBC in the documentary Secret Swami. You can check this in the transcript. Fourth, the writings of Steel and Priddy do not contradict the publications of reputable sources, like the BBC and Danish Radio, unlike the writings of Moreno, who basically writes among many other things that the investigative journalism by the BBC is flawed when writing about Rahm family. (I have some inside knowledge about the way the BBC worked and they omitted several testimonies by sexual abuse victims and choose to focus on the Rahm family, among others because everything had to be cramped in a one-hour documentary.)</p>
<p>Another thing with regards to the accusations of Moreno about my behavior that I should not have attributed statements to him. I think my behavior is clearly backed up by Wikipedia guidelines and policies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the excerpt from <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">wikipedia:NPOV</a> that states that views have to be attributed. "To write from a neutral point of view, one presents controversial views without asserting them; to do that, it generally suffices to present competing views in a way that is more or less acceptable to their adherents, and also to attribute the views to their adherents. Disputes are characterized in Wikipedia. They are not re-enacted." In this case, attributing statements only revealed the fact that those statements are only sourced from a non-notable homepage.</dd>
<dd>Here is another excerpt that proves that attribution by me of opinions to Moreno was fully justified. (This is a guideline, not a policy though) <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite_sources</a> "The need for citations is especially important when writing about the opinions held on a particular issue. Avoid weasel words such as, "Some people say…" Instead, make your writing verifiable: find a specific person or group who holds that opinion, mention them by name, and give a citation to some place where they can be seen or heard expressing that opinion. Remember that Wikipedia is not a place for expressing your opinions or for original research."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also Moreno/SSS108 confuses links to homepage with information or opinions sourced to homepages. The <s>first</s> latter is clearly discouraged or even forbidden by policy, but I have not seen any guideline or policy that says or discourages that linking to media articles published on homepages is forbidden or discouraged. If so, where do policies or guidelines say so? I admit, of course, that it is better to link directly to the BBC than to the anti-SSB websites <a href="http://www.saiguru.net" class="external free" title="http://www.saiguru.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.saiguru.net</a> and <a href="http://www.exbaba.com" class="external free" title="http://www.exbaba.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbaba.com</a> if the material is available online at the website of the BBC. I have already made a start with bypassing the anti-SSB websites saiguru.net and exbaba.com. I had not done this in the past, mainly because it was easier and more convenient for me to link to exbaba.com, not because I wanted to promote exbaba.com: after all I know the website quite well, but even I occasionally encounter something there of which I was not aware. If the material is only available on www.exbaba.com and www.saiguru.net then I think this justifies linking to these websites, because online references have clearly added value to the reader. Not everybody has access to a university library around the corner. Of course it become a different matter if those media article are interspersed with comments by the editors of exbaba, or apologist comments, but this is as far as I am aware not the case, with the exception of one article published in the Dutch newspaper <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouw.html" title="Trouw">Trouw</a>, mistranslated by the Dutch American Ella Evers. Probably most of the writings by Moreno cannot be sourced to any media article or scholarly sources. This is, I believe, an indication that Moreno wants to publish his original research in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Moreno also seems to confuse neutrality with NPOV. Wikipedia is not neutral about the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth_theory.html" title="Flat earth theory">Flat earth theory</a>, but it does follow NPOV policies. NPOV means following media and scholarly articles and opinions, not minimizing them or excluding them because they are non-neutral or "biased".</p>
<p>Further what I personally see as a major problem is that Moreno publishes all my e-mails on his homepage with all kinds of suggestive and misguided comments. How can I properly communicate with him if he behaves in such a way?</p>

<p>Although the setting of ground rules might seem to be the first order of business, my instincts suggest that we try an experiment first. I think all parties agree that the article should be neutral and balanced, but opinions vary regarding what constitutes neutral and balanced. I would like, as the first order of business to do a little exploration to find out if there is room for agreement on some basic issues, such as the percentage of the main article that would need to be devoted to criticisms of SSB if that article were to be accepted as neutral and balanced by all parties. Its possible there is room for agreement, but it is also possible that the parties are far apart on this. So, I'd like to explore this a bit.</p>
<p><strong>What I would like each of you to do</strong> is to answer the questions below. Please note that the questions are about a hypothetical article which is neutral and balanced. If you say that a neutral and balanced article would not have more than <i>x</i> percent of its space devoted to criticisms, that would not imply that if the current article has less than <i>x</i> percent then it is neutral, nor does it mean that if the current article were adjusted to have less than <i>x</i> percent that it would be neutral. What it means is that any article which has more than <i>x</i> percent would not be neutral. Please try to give justifications for your answers. For example,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I think article <i>y</i> is neutral and balanced. The subject of article <i>y</i> is similar to the subject of the SSB article in the following ways. It contains <i>x</i> percent devoted to criticisms, so I think a neutral SSB article should not have more/less than <i>x</i> percent devoted to criticisms."</dd>

<dd>(<strong>I am more interested in the answers to the two questions than I am in arguments that might be raised to support the particular numbers chosen.</strong> I am at fault for conveying the impression that I am more interested in the arguments which support those numbers than is the case at the moment. I think the arguments are important, but I really want to see the numbers soon, even if they are high and low limits that you have chosen merely because your gut says they are OK.)

<p>I have not seen a response from Thaumaturgic regarding the acceptable high and low limits for the critical content of the main SSB article. However, Thaumaturgic had expressed previously an intention to "watch the discussion and add occasional comments", so I will not wait. I note that the high limit for SSS108 is 25%, which is the low limit of Andries. Unfortunately, there is not very much overlap. However, with the figures given, it would be theoretically possible for there to be a balanced article, which could be recognized as such by both parties (if we examine only this one aspect, namely the percentage of critical content).</p>
<p>What I would like to ask now are the following questions.</p>
<p>1. Approximately what percentage of the current article would you say is critical?</p>
<ul>
<li>SSS108 Approximately 50% of the article is critical (including Anti-Sai references, Anti-Sai media articles and not factoring in the long list of books written by SSB) I feel this is unfair because the article is <b>not</b> about the controversy. It is supposed to be about SSB, of which the controversy is but a part. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 02:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thaumaturgic I agree with SSS108. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 02:39, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Andries I did a word count of the main body of text that has in total 5.978 words. The total amount of words that deal with the criticisms incl. rebuttals, but excl. the sex change is 3.802. This means that the percentage of material that deals with criticism, opposition and controversy is 63%. Even I think that this is too high, thought it was considerable lower before SSS108 and Thaumaturgic insisted on adding rebuttals some of which, but not all are spurious, because solely based on SSS108's homepage. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 02:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Can you agree as follows: If the the article is at any time over 40% critical, that you will refrain from adding further critical material?</p>
<ul>
<li>SSS108 I don't add Anti-Sai information. So the question is irrelevant to me. My personal homepage, Andries personal homepage and the personal homepages of Anti-Sai Activists should <b>all</b> be left out of a <b>neutral</b> article. 40% dedicated to the controversy, on the Main Page, seems completely unreasonable to me. I am sure Anti-Sais will be very happy with that percentage <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 02:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thaumaturgic 40% is unacceptable to me. If, as SSS108 pointed out, the article was specifically about the Sathya Sai Baba Controversy, I would agree. However, 40% of the total main page is disproportionately high. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 02:39, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Andries If the 40% of the article deals with controversy, rebuttals and criticism sourced from notable sources then I will not add anything. However if the rebuttals are sourced from non-notable homepages who engage in original research then I may add surrebuttals. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 02:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>3. If the answer to the above question is no, please explain why you feel you cannot agree to the previous item.</p>
<ul>

<li>Andries The distortion and sophism on SSS108's homepage, his selective excessive scepticism, and his ad hominem attacks on critics are an insult to people who experienced serious harm due to their involvement to SSB. If Moreno/SSS108 is allowed to quote extensively from his homepage then the same standards for inclusion and exclusion should be applied to critical material. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 11:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>4. Please give a percentage such that if the critical material within the article ever rises above this level, you agree to refrain from adding further critical material.</p>

<li>Andries Again, I think that all major controversies and allegations desribed in reputable sources should be mentioned which is not yet the case now. If all parties follow Wikipedia policies, which is not the case now, and if the major controversies are treated then I will not add critical material when the percentage is above 40%.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 11:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><strong>Please note. The questions above are not asking whether you would consider an article which consisted of 40% critical material to be balanced.

<dd>I am referring to Andries and Thaumaturgic. Andries' low limit is 25%, and Thaumaturgic's high limit is 20%. That would make it unlikely for there to be a version that both parties would agree is balanced, so I think the difference in ranges needs to be explored further. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 12:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>OK, several issue have arisen that I think need to be addressed before moving forward.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no longer any overlap between the acceptable critical content ranges of Thaumaturgic and of Andries.</li>
<li>Andries has expressed a feeling that more critical material needs to be added.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the first item: Thaumaturgic and Andries, could you please give as best you are able, rationales for why you chose 20% and 25% respectively for your respective high and low limits. Please do not take too much time in your explanation. A paragraph or two will suffice. Also, please do not bother to argue against the other party's position at this time. Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Andries I chose 25% because I do not want to appear unreasonable and 48.3% for the high percentage based on a calculation that I made elsewhere on this talk page. Controversy is nowadays a substantial part of the SSB story.</li>
<li>Thaumaturgic: I chose 20% for my high and 10% for my low. The main article is about Sathya Sai Baba. It is not an article specifically about the controversy surrounding Sathya Sai Baba. There is already another page dedicated to the controversy on the "Allegations Against Sathya Sai Baba" page. Dedicating 40% of the article to the controversy is turning the main page into a controversy page. I feel that the article is full of personal bias and once a neutral point of view is enforced, the amount of text dedicated to the controversy will significantly shorten. Since the article is about Sathya Sai Baba, his life, teachings &amp; philosophy, practices, organizations, charitable activites, centers, miracles, etc., I think dedicating 1/5th of the article to the controversy is fair. It is also seen that important information about the Sathya Sai Organization and beliefs &amp; practices are put on separate pages. Why is that important information allowed to be put on separate pages, but then when it comes to the controversy, 40% of the article is going to be dedicated to it? On the main page, no one subject is given 40% leeway. Giving the controversy that much space is disproportionate. That is the reason for the percentages I gave. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 05:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the second item: Andries. I am sorry to hear that a friend of yours was close to suicide. I can understand your feelings about this. Other editors have not expressed to me their views regarding whether or not mention of the suicides belongs in the article. At this point I would like to put that question aside for the moment. But lets assume, for the sake of argument that the article should mention these suicides. If I understand your position, you believe the article to contain 63% critical material, and should not exceed 48.3%, leaving aside my proposal for a voluntary 40% cap. You also agree that the current percentages are excessive. My question to you is this. Do you need to add your additional critical material right now? Or can you wait until the article has become more balanced? Could you help to improve the balance first? I would very much appreciate it if you would give some thought to these questions, and share them here. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 03:45, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I feel that Wikipedia policies completely allow me to summarize the Times article on the suicides. I also personally said something similar about suicides on Dutch TV on 11-11-2002, but I would rather quote the Times than myself and besides the TV programme in which I voiced my opinion was not really reputable. Yes, the percentage of the material that deals with the controversy is 63% in the current version and I consider this too high. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 04:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would rather not get into the concrete question of whether the suicides belong, or do not belong, in the article. Rather what I want to focus on is the question of whether you are willing to help bring the article closer to being balanced before new critical material is added. If you have a strong opposition to waiting before new critical material is added, I would like to understand why you have this opposition.

<dd>As I had already stated, my preferred way with dealing with this article is removing or improving clearly identified violations of wikipedia policies within a week. Due to the controversial nature of the subject, a high proportion of criticism is not a clearly identified violation of Wikipedia policies. However as a compromise, I will add no criticism in the coming two weeks, even if they are fully justified by notable and reputable sources, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>. By the way, I had made an alternative version of the article <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_Sathya_Sai_Baba_eb69.html" title="User:Andries/Sathya Sai Baba">User:Andries/Sathya_Sai_Baba</a> that does not blatantly violate Wikipedia policies such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a>, unlike the current version of the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Off-topic:I also feel that regardless of the dispute between me and Moreno/Thaumaturgic, other editors could do more work to improve the article. 90% of the article was written by me and almost all the references were provided by me (if we exclude the paragraphs only sourced by Moreno's homepage). There is still a lot to improve that is unrelated to the dispute between me and Moreno/Thaumaturgic. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moreno has provided additional information about these suicides that The Times did not make mention to. Moreno's information was even taken directly from David Bailey, a Sai Antagonist. One of the three people who committed suicide was not even a Sai Devotee. He was a very disturbed person, even according to the police, who simply visited Sathya Sai Baba's ashram before he killed himself in Bangalore. No one, from any Sai Center knew who he was. According to David Bailey, Keith Ord and the Times, the other 2 people were severely disturbed. One was homeless and hiv+ and killed himself. The other was, according to David Bailey very emotionally and mentally disturbed. He would even call David Bailey upto 30 times a day. And no one mentions David Bailey's involvement in the man's decision to kill himself. The Times article was written years ago and does not take into account this information. It is outdated. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 06:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Off topic, Thaumaturgic and Moreno, why don't you e-mail the Times, the BBC, Danish Radio, the EU parliament, Lousewies van der Laan, India Today, US state dept and show them Moreno's website and request them to retract their warnings and articles or to make updates? If you succeed in doing so then this can be stated in the article. Now it is just a homepage against many reputable media and institutions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:45, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, why don't you explain why The Times left out David Bailey and Keith Ord's statements about 2 of the suicide victims? These two people are Anti-Sai Activists. Also, you have already said, numerous times, that the BBC, Danish Raido, etc., were biased against SSB and were favorably inclined towards Anti-Sai Activists. So you have already explained why they would speak out against SSB. They were biased. Even you admitted it.</p>

<p>Andries has agreed to not add new critical material to the main SSB article for a two week period. My suggestion is that, during these two weeks, in addition to the discussion which is taking place on this page, a strong effort is made to increase the content of the non-critical sections and/or add new sections. For example I would imagine that the "teachings" section could go into much greater depth. (I am far less familiar with the sources available, but I would guess that this is possible.)</p>
<p>I believe the discussion on this page should continue during the next two weeks. However, I think it would be unfortunate if sufficient advantage were not taken of Andries offer of compromise. Adding new material may or might bring to the fore other issues or disputes. I hope those issues can be dealt with on this page in a timely fashion, so that some lasting improvements can be made to the article. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 13:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your question, but this is a difficult question so I have to think about it. I do not know any comparable living person, but I see however some parallels with <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> in 1. the magnitude of the claims made about himself. 2. the mythical proportions of the persons. (father of mankind, "love of a thousand mothers" etc) 3. the variety of miracles attributed and claimed by these persons 4. the lack of reputable, reliable sources for the biography. In other regards, SSB is more comparable to <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Hubbard_68e0.html" title="Ron Hubbard">Ron Hubbard</a> with regards to the degree of controversy about his life and thoroughely debunked claims. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:09, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Cleary, controversy is a major part of the SSB story <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/shortnews/frameset.html?page=bigthings" class="external text" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/shortnews/frameset.html?page=bigthings" rel="nofollow">"The God of Big Things"</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonely_Planet_3095.html" title="Lonely Planet">Lonely Planet</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To finally answer your question, I think that a fair proportion of the article devoted to criticism, opposition, and controversy would be the same for <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Hubbard_68e0.html" title="Ron Hubbard">Ron Hubbard</a> (section "Controversial episodes") that is 25%. This excludes information about the sex change and views on the guru. I would prefer the original organization of the article that separated concrete criticisms on SSB from views on the guru (charlatan, divine incarnation, devil, anti-christ etc.) in the same way as the religious perspectives on Jesus are distinguished from the rest of the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:18, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia normally follows scholarly and media articles, so to give a good and justified answer on this, I think, we would have to analyze the post 2000/post-Bailey media and scholarly articles. One of the notable articles that did not voice criticism was the New York Times article by Keith Bradsher (that contained factual mistakes). A very important article was the long cover story by <a href="../../../i/n/d/India_Today_c149.html" title="India Today">India Today</a> that was about 80% criticism if not more<a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/frameset.html?page=god" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/articles/frameset.html?page=god" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I asked some Indian colleagues about the magazine and they considered it a reliable source. The majority in Wikipedia is not formed by the number of adherents but what reputable media articles and scholarly sources say. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:49, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to begin by saying that I am more interested in the answers to the two questions I initially raised, than I am in arguments that might be raised to support the particular numbers chosen. I am at fault for giving conveying the impression that I am more interested in the arguments which support those numbers than is the case at the moment. I think the arguments are important, but I really want to see the numbers soon, even if they are high and low limits that you have chosen merely because your gut says they are OK.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the particular question of what criteria should be employed in determining whether an article meets NPOV, my suggestion is to continue along the lines you initially took when you mentioned the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Hubbard_68e0.html" title="Ron Hubbard">Ron Hubbard</a>, that is, to compare or contrast one encyclopedia article with another. That is my answer to your particular question, but, again, I don't want this to be an exercise in scouring pages and counting lines of criticism unless we find there is no other road open. I again apologize for insufficiently emphasizing what part of the task I felt was most important. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 22:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BostonMA, I think that it would be easier if we discussed the definitions already established on Wikipedia, regarding a Neutral Point of View <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. Once we come to a consensus on what is considered <i>"neutral"</i>, based on Wikipedia's established definitions, I think that would positively facilitate this discussion, as the main point of contention has do with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>To me, <i>"balanced"</i> means that there is <b>equal opportunity</b> for each POV to be expressed. In this regard, the percentage issue, in my opinion, is irrelevant. For example, Andries may be able to cite numerous sources, writing many paragraphs, about alleged molestations. However, the Pro-Sai POV can be easily summarized in several sentences. Although the amount of space dedicated to each is disproportionate, as long as there is <b>equal opportunity</b> to fully express an opposing POV, then I believe the article could be considered to be <i>"balanced"</i>.</p>
<p>However, the issue of <i>"neutrality"</i> completely changes <b>everything</b>. For something to be <i>"neutral"</i>, it cannot be aligned with, or supportive, to one side of a dispute or discussion. Therefore, in my opinion, one of the hallmarks of a <i>"neutral"</i> article is that the percentage of text devoted to Pro/Con viewpoints is fairly equal, around 50/50. If an article is over 65% devoted to an issue, I would suspect the <i>"neutrality"</i> of the article (unless reasons were given). This is the standard I think most would expect from an Encyclopedia that provides factual information that is <b>not</b> based on subjective opinions and unconfirmed allegations.</p>
<p>To specifically answer you question: between 60% - 40% (or vice versa) is the range I consider to be neutral.</p>

<p>I would argue that you may be going in the wrong direction with this. The questions by BonstonMA, as I see it, are questions to help him understand your positions as it pertains to your concept of "balanced". Jumping to procedural actions, at this point is highly premature and IMO, dangerous, as it displaces the non-negotiable principle of NPOV with an arbitrary assessment of "balanced". For example, one side is remind in us the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> principle of undeue weight, in which it is stated that "Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views", but fails to address what minority means in this context.</p>

<p>Hi. I would like to ask a question on the side. It sounds as though you are arguing that a neutral and balanced Wikipedia article ought to have the same proportion of criticism as a newspaper or magazine article or scholarly article. Is that your position? If so, could you raise some arguments that might overcome my reluctance to accept that? My reluctance with regard to media is that media follow trends, what is "in the news", and this changes over time. My reluctance with regard to scholarly articles, is that a common criteria for a scholarly article to be considere worthy of publication is that it contains new or unpublished results, not that it provides an balanced overview of the subject. Thus, I would be reluctant to consider scholarly papers as a general models for encyclopedia articles. Perhaps I have raised concerns unnecessarily, but if it is your position that an encyclopedia article ought to have the same proportion of criticism as a media article or a scholarly article, then please help me to overcome my reservations. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 20:27, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is true that the media change over time and the list of media articles and scholarly articles that I made hereunder shows only the last 6 years, that is post 2000/Bailey's <i>The Findings</i> that was a major turning point in the debates about SSB. I think six years is long of a time frame to give a balanced over view. I do not see other fair and reasonable criteria to make a NPOV article. What criteria do you suggest? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:46, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...This leads to an unweighted of average <s>47%</s> 48.3%. Based on this, I think that following the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> means that we devote this percentage to the treatment of criticism and controvery.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:33, 4 February 2006 (UTC) (amended, BBC documentary and Danish Radio documentary)</p>
<p>...Well, I did not not do a word count, but that was just a rough guess. AND AGAIN AGAIN I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER FOR WIKIPEDIA THAT YOU CONSIDER THE MEDIA AND SCHOLARS BIASED.

<p>For example, one side is remind in us the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> principle of undeue weight, in which it is stated that "Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views", but fails to address what minority means in this context. If, for example, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> sells 10,000,000 albums, and on the other hand a few music critics state in published sources that her music is below standards, what is the majority position in this case, the one of the fans that clearly thing otherwise about her music, or the one of her critics? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 21:37, 4 February 2006 (UTC)#</p>

<dd>To me it is clear that the majority view is not formed by the nr. of adherents, but by scholars and reputable sources. We do not allow the physics aricle to e.g state that a ball makes a warped curves, only if many people believe this (and they do based when based on interviews).

<dd>I also think that the comparison by Jossi with the critics of Britney Spears' music is flawed. The controversy about SSB is not just a matter of taste, that is whether you like his teachings or not, but is far more fundamental and it touches the core of his SSB's mission and claims of avatarhood: false miracles, sexual abuse and much more. It would be more comparable if there was a documented notable accusation that Britney Spears plagiarized all her songs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Since when did the Anti-Sai POV become a majority opinion? SSB has millions of followers and there are no more than 50 or 60 people who openly oppose him.

<p>That is the point I am making Jossie. Of course, the Anti-Sai POV should be included in the article. However, Andries just said, as he has said many times before, that the Pro-Sai POV is a Minority POV. It isn't. Therefore, the article should reflect the Majority POV, which happens to be favorable.</p>

<dd>To answer your question who should make a distinction what is scholarly or not. I think the answer is that the contributors of Wikipedia do this, incl. me. I have read the book (at least some of it) and I did not find it scholarly nor am I aware that it is favorably authoratively cited in any scholarly article about SSB. I will not use it as a source and I would be unhappy if contributors chose otherwise. With regards to the 1995 book by Peter van der Veer, I never meant to say that it cannot be used as a source only because it is pre-2000, but what I meant to say that it is not a good source to determine the fraction of criticsm that should go into this article because it predates the major controversy about SSB. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:36, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brian Steel and Alexandra Nagel <b>openly</b> oppose Sathya Sai Baba. They are critics and their viewpoints are <b>not</b> neutral. Andries wants to cite Brian Steel simply because Alexandra Nagel made reference to him in one of her papers. Other than Nagel, there are no notable references that cite Steel. If either of these individuals did not profess being Anti-Sai, then maybe one could make a case for neutrality based on objective research. However both of them have openly admitted being Anti-Sai Activists and their research is dedicated to that end. Therefore, citing them is promoting an Anti-Sai POV.</p>

<p>Andries, make us a list of <b>neutral</b> scholars against SSB? So far, you can only cite Nagel and you attempt to include Steel by association, (since he was referenced by Nagel in one of her papers). Both Steel and Nagel are not neutral. Neither Steel or Nagel have any qualifications or credentials that entitle them to be called "scholars" in regards to SSB. Steel may be a scholar in Spanish and Nagel may become a scholar once she gets her MA this year or next year. Once again, Steel and Nagel openly oppose SSB. They are <b>not</b> neutral. So even if you call them scholars, their neutrality is totally disputed. How do Steel and Nagel support a NPOV?</p>

<dd>okay, agreed. I do not know the qualifications that Nagel had then, but the undisputed fact is that she then wrote a scholarly article about SSB <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 01:51, 5 February 2006 (UTC) (amended)

<p>Andries, how does Alexandra Nagel's article come close to Wikipedia's neutral point of view? She is antagonistic against Sathya Sai Baba. As SSS108 and I keep saying, she is not neutral. You keep defending Alexandra Nagel's "scholarly" article, but you have yet to defend her neutrality. That's because she has publicly stated being against Sathya Sai Baba for almost 13/14 years. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 02:44, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will say this one more time, but no more. The discussion about this purported "scholarly" article by an ex-follower is inconsequential in light of dozens of published books on the subject that are neither mentioned nor cited in the current article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 03:15, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jossi, I will try to check the articles that you mentioned, but I would be very surprized if it contained any substantial post-2000/post-Bailey's Findings material on SSB. You yourself wrote on the talk page that you were unable to find anything, except an article by Mikael Rothstein in a book by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Richardson_4a33.html" title="James Richardson">James Richardson</a>. In other words, I am still waiting for your scholarly articles on SSB. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 03:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I gave you a partial list of books above. I would also make one point clear: I do not have a POV about the subject of this article, as I only heard about this person here in Wikipedia, and I am not here defending the POV of anyone. My only concern is that we make this article readable and informative. As it stands now this article is a great example of what a good and NPOV article is not. My concern is that in the mediation process, this does not get forgotten: we are here to write an article that complies with Wikipedia content's policies and not just to accommodate editor's opposing views. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 03:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jossi, you mentioned among others an article by Peter van der Veer who teaches at the University of Amsterdam. Do you think that Nagel who studies at the UvA would be unaware if Van der Veer had written anything substantial on SSB? Very unlikely. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 03:28, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If I recall, that book from Van der Veer contains very interesting information about Sai Baba and ISKCON in the context of their presence in Fiji, but I do not recall any information about controversies besides some dabling in internal politics of the movement in that island. There is good information in that book, and even portions of an interview with Sai. The fact that is not included in the article you refer to, is quite revealing and in aligment with my previous assessment: scholars cite selectively to prove their theses. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 04:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, thanks for the information, I will try to get that book. I noticed that a SSB school was recently opened in Fiji <a href="http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_03/12DEC01/fiji-sai-school.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_03/12DEC01/fiji-sai-school.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 04:09, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Peter van der Veer's book was published in the year 1995, that is before the year 2000 that is before the major controversy around SSB. So I do not think that van der Veer's book is a good indication of the degree of controversy that is surrounding SSB <a href="http://folk.uio.no/geirthe/Vanderveer.html" class="external text" title="http://folk.uio.no/geirthe/Vanderveer.html" rel="nofollow">Imagined Indians A review of Peter van der Veer, ed., Nation and Migration. <i>The Politics of Space in the South Asian Diaspora</i>.

<dd>The book <i>Reawakening the Spirit in Work: The Power of Dharmic Management</i> by Jack Hawley that you mentioned is not a scholarly biography for this article.

<dd>For example Schulman and Kasturi about the cobra at his birth. LIMF and Kasturi about the birthdate. LIMF and Kasturi about the year that he left school for his full time mission. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:30, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<p>Schulman did not write a biography. Okay, so there is a contradiction about SSB's birthdate. SSB's birthdate does not comprise his entire biography. And LIMF cited reasons for the discrepancy regarding the birthdate, but Anti-Sai Sites, including yours, never mentioned it: <a href="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/ssb-school.html" class="external text" title="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/ssb-school.html" rel="nofollow">Reference</a> Are these all your <i>"many contradicting sources"</i>?

<p>Conveying a "gist" is not the same as mentioning the reasons for the discrepancy, as cited in LIMF. Brain Steel did not make reference to LIMF's statements about the discrepancy, so my statement still stands.</p>

<p>Andries already said that personal homepages and original research violate wikipedia guidelines. When Andries agreed to remove personal homepages, he also removed the personal homepage of Brian Steel. Now, however, he is trying his hardest to reference him.

<p>Andries, I never contended that my website and my views were notable or accepted by mainstream media. Remember, YOU were the one who began attributing the viewpoints to me. Then YOU began to reference all the viewpoints with your personal homepages. I did the same.

<dd>Since Brian Steel and Robert Priddy are non-notable, and are not cited by any notable media regarding their articles about SSB's teachings, it is ironic that Andries is advocating for the inclusion of their non-notable homepages yet seeks the elimination of my homepage. Also, Steel and Priddy's articles would both constitute original research. So if their original research is allowed, so should mine.</dd>

<dd>There is a big difference between an external link in the section external links and using an external links as a reference.

<p>Andries response does not explain why he wants to add links to all the Anti-Sai Sites. For example, he cites Robert Priddy. Instead of citing Priddy's site, he cites every single Anti-Sai Site that simply duplicated Priddy's articles on theirs. Why does Andries do this?</p>

<p>Andries, you failed to address the points I made above about the duplicate links on SaiGuru.net and the duplicate content from Priddy and Steel's site. The point is that if the references are so scattered throughout these sites, how are people supposed to find them and see the relevance to the topic? They can't.</p>

<dd>The websites of the critics do provide a substantial amount of information about teachings and the beliefs and practice, but I have to admit that it may be somewhat difficult to find in e.g. exbaba because the website is huge. An alternative would be to provide a list of webpages, but then you will start complaining about duplicate links etc. So I think that this is the best solution. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 03:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment by Andries on Jossi's proposal: I cannot write a good detailed biography because I do not have reputable sources and the sources that I do have contradict each other. It would help if I have the 1997 book by Brian Steel and the 2000/2001? <i>Love is My Form</i> book by Padmanaban (sp.?) that I have ordered, but these sources also contradict each other. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jossi, an expanded biography can never fulfill the Wikipedia policies due to the non-availability of reputable sources. I am not saying that we should not give it a try: I just do not know at the moment, but I do think that BostonMA and Jossi have requested more from me than can reasonably requested from a Wikipedia contributor, that is that I should do a meticulous comparison of the several highly contradicting sources and compile a completely new biography that does not exist anywhere else. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:31, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, we already discussed this. You keep up bringing up "highly contradicting sources", but the contradictions you name are not even a handful. Futhermore, you keep trying to compare biographical informatation with books that were never biographies in the first place. Steel's book is not a biography. It's a compendium. Schulman's book was not a biography either. SSB's basic biography is consistent. His devotees never recorded SSBs life thinking that they had to preserve every fact for some sort of historical narrative. Although some dates don't mesh, the stories are still the same.</p>

<dd>It does not matter that books are not biographies, as long as they contain biographical information. I admit that there is some internal consistency in Kasturi's hagiography, but it remains a hagiography and hence about the least reputable source available. I agree that the books by devotees often do not mention years, dates etc.: they copied most information from Kasturi without mentioning sources and are inaccurate and hence cannot be called reputable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is always a work in progress. There is noting wrong with getting the bio section started with whatever published sources are available. If new sources are fond we can add these and if there is competing info, we can descibe these as well. I see no issue with this. My proposal to start with <b>published sources</b> first, and leave websites for later, as published material maybe less actualized, but at least is readers can easily assess reputability of these sources. For those aspects <b>not</b> available in published material, I have no problem in referring reputable online sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 04:04, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have attempted to increase the biography section and Andries deleted it. Andries even deleted the names to SSB's parents, which are indisputable! As I pointed out, on the SSB discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, an encyclopedia of world religions wrote about SSB and cited Kasturi and Sandweiss as references. If a 4 volume encyclopedia of religions cited Kasturi and Sandweiss as references, I see no reason why this article cannot do the same.</dd>
<dd>Also, Andries repeatedly said (even on this page) that there are no "reputable" sources for the biography. However, when I asked Andries to define "reputable", he <b>could not</b> define it. So how can we come to a consensus about "reputable" sources when Andries does not even know what standard he is trying to demand from others? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

<p>That is not the reason you gave for deleting the section. Your reason for deleting the section was because you wanted it referenced and you do not want to use Kasturi's hagiography as a reference (although an Encyclopedia of Religions cited Kasturi as a reference in their 4 volume set) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Although Steel, Priddy, Premanand have never been cited in an Encyclopedia, you say they are "reputable" sources and you try to include their non-notable works in this article. However, when Kasturi and Sandweiss are referenced in an official Encyclopedic reference, you argue that they should not be referenced because they wrote hagiographies and are not "reputable". Your standards are hardly consistent.</p>

<p>BostonMA, there is already a large section devoted to SSB's teachings: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs_and_practices_in_the_Sathya_Sai_Organisation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs_and_practices_in_the_Sathya_Sai_Organisation" rel="nofollow">Beliefs and Practices</a> On the Main Page, SSB's Teachings are summarized into <b>4 paragraphs</b>, with a link that goes to the full article.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding your position, but the impression that I get from your comment is not only that 19 paragraphs for opposition is excessive, but that 4 paragraphs for teaching (and other sections?) is sufficient. Please let me know if I have misunderstood you. I see that there is a separate article for the teachings of SSB. I am not sure of the rationale behind placing that material in a separate article. However, I would imagine that both the main article and the teachings article could be greatly expanded. Of course I am only one person, but my expectations for an encyclopedia article about SSB would be that it contained significantly more information about his teachings than is present. Where does SSB fit in relation to other trends in hinduism, or to other ecumenical movements? What is SSB's attitude toward, or relationship with other gurus? What are SSB's teachings with regard to <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varna_%28caste%29.html" title="Varna (caste)">Varna</a>? Does he tolerate caste distinctions? Does he condemn them? What are his teaching with regard to family relationships? The position of women in religious organizations? Does he teach a theory of <a href="../../../j/y/o/Jyotisha.html" title="Jyotisha">Jyotisha</a>? Does he reject it? I would expect of SSB, as a guru, to have a position on the purpose of life. What does he say about this? I don't mean for you to answer any of these questions here. However, I think explaining SSB's positions on questions like these, as far as they are documented, would be an enhancement to the article.

<dd>I finally found a statement that the SSB movement is unrelated to caste, a fact that even superficially involved persons can confirm and inserted in the beliefs and practices article. It would be even better to find a quote by SSB or by his hagiographer Kasturi about this. I think that Robert Priddy maintained a cross-index of SSB's writings on many subjects that helps to find citations. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, you are misunderstanding, BostonMA. On the Main Page, long sections are summarized in a few paragraphs, with a link going to a separate page with the full article. However, this is <b>not</b> what is being done with the Critics section, although a separate page exists! The Critics section comprises about 50% of the Main Article and then has <b>another</b> page, on the "Allegations Against Sathya Sai Baba" page, that discusses the <b>same</b> material more in depth. If other sections are summarized on the Main Article with links going to separate pages, why can't the same be done with the Critics section? Why have 2 pages dedicated to the <b>same</b> material to begin with? This has been done for the past 14 months without complaint.</p>

<dd>Thank you for the clarification, but I am still confused. Whether or not you are saying it, I am hearing you say that you think that 4 paragraphs for the teachings of SSB are sufficient, and the reason is that there exists another page which goes into more depth.

I also do not know why SSB's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_origins_of_the_Sathya_Sai_Baba_movement" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_origins_of_the_Sathya_Sai_Baba_movement" rel="nofollow">History and Origins</a> are summarized and linked to a separate page. From what I understand, since these subjects are lengthy, they are summarized on the Main Page and are linked to the indepth article. However, when it comes to the Critics section, it is <b>not</b> summarized on the Main Page although there is another in depth page that is devoted to the issue: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" rel="nofollow">Allegations against Sathya Sai Baba</a></p>
<p>Andries was the person who created all these separate pages. I see no problem summarizing and linking to an in depth article. However, Andries has made the <b>full</b> case against SSB not only on the Main Article, but also on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" rel="nofollow">Allegations against Sathya Sai Baba</a> page (yes, the contain the same information). Why isn't the Critics section summarized on the main page, like the other sections (with a link to the in depth article)? Even if this was done, there is still the issue of bias and the promotion of an Anti-Sai POV through the referenced links. But that a different discussion.</p>

<dd>Hi SSS108. I'm glad you asked. Things at this page seemed surprisingly quiet. There could be a number of reasons for this. I think I've pushed things in a direction that the parties perhaps did not expect, and everyone needed time to thing about the new direction and new arguments. Another possibility is that people became frustrated with my mediation, but rather than say anything became quiet. It also crossed my mind that editors might be used to the conflict and not used to working together, and that they were waiting for me to leave so they could return to their more familiar activity&#160;;-) In any event, I don't really know why it has been so quiet, it could just be that people are busy. But I'm glad you raised a question.</dd>
<dd>Jossi made a "soft" objection to moving text from the "teachings" section to the main article, saying "it depends". Other than that, I have heard no real objection. That doesn't mean that everyone agrees, they may not be vocal about it. I have no objection to such a move. I think it would help reduce the preponderance of critical material, which all parties have agreed is a problem. If you also have no objection, my suggestion is to wait a bit, to see if my comment here draws any strong comments. If other parties remain quiet on the issue, my supposition would be that there is consensus, and that you should begin moving text as you feel appropriate. Let's give it a little more time though.</dd>
<dd>I don't know whether that was the motive for your question. If you had something else in mind, or if you are opposed to this idea, then please set me straight. One final opinion I will share. Even if all the content in the teachings article were moved to the main article, I still think that a great deal <strong>new</strong> could be written on SSB teachings that would improve the SSB "articles", whether the teachings article is separate or not. Again, please let me know if you had something entirely different in mind when you asked the question. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 01:49, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, BostonMA. Personally, nothing has happened that I did not expect. My arguments are still the same. It seems, however, that everyone does not object to the Teachings section being listed on a separate page. I feel the same way you do about the Teachings section. Undoubtedly, it requires more work. I think the article can be improved with time. Nevertheless, the main points of contention revolve around the Critics Section: Content, References, Links, Notable Sources, etc. I don't think anyone is debating the content on the Teachings section or other sections. Our disagreements revolve around the controversy. Do you still want us to work on the content on other sections, when they are not the contentious issues?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Also, I think that having the Teachings section listed on another page might become an issue if the Allegations section is left, in full, on the main page. Then, I would see every reason to include the other sections in full too. But this would make for a very long article.</dd>

<dd>Hi. I understand that there are a number of points of contention other than the percentage of space devoted to criticisms. My proposal is not to stop working on those issues, but to work on those issues while at the same time working to together to fix the article in ways in which all parties agree it needs fixing. Controversies around the links, references etc. need to be resolved, but there is nothing that says we must have an article which is recognized as unbalanced in another way during the interim.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You and Andries may have different visions for what the final article should be. It is conceivable however, that an article with around 25% dealing with criticism could be acceptable to you both. However, even if the article never gets to a form that will satisfy everyone, I think it is important that as long as your vision and Andries vision are both (at least at this moment) in the same direction from where the article is at present, that efforts be made to improve the article, and not stall on these improvements on the ground that ultimately your visions are different.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the effects of working in that direction is that it will help to address concerns among the Wikipedia community at large that the parties work toward writing a good encyclopedia, and not merely push their own point of view. It is also possible that removing or reducing one source of friction, may help in the resolution of other points of contention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You raise the issue of the relationship between having a spin-off article for teachings, and one for criticisms. I am open to hearing other points of view, however, my own POV is that whether there is a spin-off article for "teachings" or a spin-off article for "criticisms" are two independent questions. For me, spin-off articles are a means to correct problems with the main article. If a teachings section made the main article too long, or made the article appear unbalanced in favor of SSB, then a spin-off article might be appropriate. The issues are similar, but independent for a criticisms spin-off article. If the volume of criticism in the main article make the article too long, or unbalanced, then a spin-off article may be appropriate. SSS108, or any of the other parties, please let me know if you see things different from the way I have presented them. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 14:30, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a clarification, I do not object to merging back content from related articles. The caveat was, that if these are too long, these can be summarized and the main content kept on a separate article. The focus of the article should be on the biographical aspects of this person. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 16:47, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>BostonMA, I cannot think of any other points of contention besides the Controversy Issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have not seen this point specifically addressed, although it has been raised several times, but there is already a "spin-off" article for the Controversy. It's listed under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" rel="nofollow">Allegations against Sathya Sai Baba</a> No other section has TWO complete sections devoted to it. The full case for the Controversy is made on the Main Page and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_against_Sathya_Sai_Baba" rel="nofollow">Allegations against Sathya Sai Baba</a> page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since it appears that all parties are satisfied with the Teachings section, then I would say we agree it is neutral. So it wouldn't matter if the Teachings section was put back on the Main Article or not. Since we all seem to agree on the Teachings section, it would not make the Main Article imbalanced because no one is complaining about the neutrality of that section.</dd>

<dd>I have no problem making the teachings section somewhat longer. I guess the average reader will not be interested in a detailed treatment of the teachings so I think it is important not making it too long. The lack of interest in the article <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beliefs_and_practices_in_the_Sathya_Sai_Organisation_37dd.html" title="Beliefs and practices in the Sathya Sai Organisation">Beliefs and practices in the Sathya Sai Organisation</a> may be due to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMain_article_fixation_f153.html" title="Wikipedia:Main article fixation">Wikipedia:main article fixation</a>. The "Teachings" section is now together with the "Mircles, claims and ashrams" subsection of "beliefs and practices" section. One can hardly distinguish claims and teachings by SSB from "beliefs and practices" because committed devotees treat SSB's books and teachings as <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">scripture</a>, in other words they believe everything that SSB says and writes. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 14:15, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem with the article teachings and articles "Beliefs and practices" is the lack of references, that are mainly due to the lack of accurate, reputable, and detailed summaries of the teachings. It is possible, of course, to reference the subsection and the article "Beliefs and practices" to many individual articles and one of SSB's many public discourses, but this is very tedious: I have read so much by and about SSB, but it is not easy to remember where I read what. For years I have been a member of a study circle in an SSB group. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 14:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, once again, you keep using the word "reputable". You keep demanding that all the articles be "reputable", yet when I asked you to define that word, you couldn't do it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba#Please_provide_references" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> That is why no one can understand where you are coming from and what you are demanding. You attempt to set a certain standard known to you alone. You also expect others to understand this standard although you are incapable of communicating it.</p>
<p>So once again, you need to define "reputable". Until you do so, no will understand what exactly you are asking for.</p>

<dl>
<dd>SSS108, a definition of the word reputable (apart from the trivial "with a good <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reputation.html" title="Reputation">reputation</a>") is a difficult, general discussion that, I think, has little place here. A better place to discuss this is, I think, after reading <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> is at its talk page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:59, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Andries, the definition for "reputable" has every place here. Why? Because <b>you</b> keep demanding that sources be "reputable" (so far, you have used this word 23 times on this page alone). Although citing Kasturi and Sandweiss would clearly fall into <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a>, you are arguing against them. Then you argue in favor of Brian Steel although mentioning him would clearly <b>not</b> fall into <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a>. Since you keep demanding that sources be "reputable", one would think you would know what you are demanding.</p>

<dl>
<dd>SSS108, If you seriously think that Sandweiss and Kasturi are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:reliable sources</a> then we have to come to the conclusion that our opinions are so wide apart that there is no chance that we will ever have an article that we both consider neutral. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Andries, then tell me how Kasturi and Sandweiss would not be considered reputable sources when they were cited in the 4 volume <i>"Religions Of The World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia Of Beliefs And Practices"</i> by J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann? Morton Klass (who is a well published author in college references) has also written about SSB in <i>"Reinventing Religions: Syncretism and Transformation in Africa and the Americas"</i>. Klass cited Kasturi, Murphet and Sandweiss. In <i>"Redemptive Encounters&#160;: Three Modern styles in the Hindu Tradition"</i>, by Lawrence A. Bapp, he also cites Kasturi. If all these well published and notable sources reference Kasturi, Sandweiss and Murphet, tell me how, by citing these three, it would violate <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:reliable sources</a>?</p>
<p>Then in contrast, you seek the inclusion of Brian Steel, Robert Priddy and Basava Premanand as references although they have <b>never</b> been cited in notable references or publications.</p>

<dd>I can see that Sandweiss and Kasturi can be used for the beliefs and practices section and the beliefs and practices article. But to state their experiences and hagiographies as facts, as if they were reliable sources is ridiculous, I think. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:26, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Who is asking that their experiences be stated as facts? I am not aware of anyone making that claim. Why are you limiting the references to Kasturi and Sandweiss to the "Beliefs and Practices" page when the "Beliefs and Practices" page is not dependent on Kasturi or Sandweiss as references? Kasturi and Sandweiss are notable references that have been used in college references and even in a Religion Encyclopedia regarding SSB's life. Therefore, a section will be written about SSB's bibliography, citing Kasturi because if these notable publications can cite Kasturi, I see no reason why Wikipedia can't.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Reliable Sources</a> policy begins with the statements:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia articles should use reliable published sources. This page is an attempt to provide guidance about how to identify these. The two policy pages that discuss the need to use sources are Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Verifiability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you can provide useful information to Wikipedia, please do so, but bear in mind that edits for which no credible references are provided may be deleted by any editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What follows is a description of Wikipedia's best practices. Many articles may fall short of this standard until one or more editors devote time and effort to fact-checking and reference-running. (See efforts to identify reliable sources.) In the meantime, readers can still benefit from your contributions, bearing in mind that unsourced edits, or edits relying on inappropriate sources, may be challenged at any time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As I read these paragraphs, they seem to me to be saying several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Editors are warned that information, even if useful, may be deleted at any time if that information is not supported by credible references.</li>
<li>Editors are implicitly promised that they may delete information, even if useful, if that information is not supported by credible references.</li>
<li>Editors are welcome to contribute useful information to Wikipedia, even if that information is not supported by credible references.</li>
</ol>
<p>Put another way, as I read this, the policy does not <strong>forbid</strong> adding useful information which is unsupported by credible references, but <strong>allows</strong> such material to be removed.</p>
<p>What I would like to know from each of the parties is the answers to the following question:</p>
<p><strong>Do you understand the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia as I have described them, or do you understand the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia differently?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Andries: I think I understand the policies and guidelines quite well as described by BostonMA, but I hope for some leniency of contributors in applying this policy and guideline for the beliefs and practices about which there is no serious dispute. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:12, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>SSS108: BostonMA, yes, I feel I understand the polices. I also agree with Thumaturgic's comments about <i>"credible references"</i>. Apparently, the standard used for <i>"credible references"</i> varies significantly. Whatever leniency Andries asks for, I want too. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 02:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thaumaturgic: I believe I understand what the policies are essentially conveying. But it seems there are misunderstandings when it comes to "credible references". I, myself, am confused about what truly constitutes "credible references". I am actually quite surprised Andries is asking for "leniency". If he gets the "leniency" he wants, I am sure that the beliefs and practices section will very soon become highly disputed. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 01:11, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Andries, you already admitted that these "reputable" sources are biased. Once again, you are using the word "reputable". However, I have discussed this several times and you do not even know what you mean by using the word "reputable". Even after admitting this, you continue to use the word "reputable" to defend your POV. The sources you want to cite do not advocate for a NPOV. Not only that, the references you cite are many years old and nothing has come about from them.</p>
<p>Andries, Jossie's point is well taken. You keep saying there are no reputable sources for SSB. Why should we have an article about SSB if there are no reputable references?</p>

<dd>If you think that there should be no article about SSB due to the lack of reputable sources then I suggest that you will try to get it deleted.

<p>Andries, no one is trying to get it deleted. You are the one making the case that there are no "reputable" resources about SSB, except the critcism against him. If that is truly the case, then one could argue that the article should be deleted on the premise of <b>your</b> arguement, i.e., there are no reputable resources about him. Why keep an article that has no reputable resources? After all, that is the case you are trying to make.</p>

<dd>That was a pertinent question, given your assessment about the lack of reputable sources for a biography (that is what this article is supposed to be, by the way). Without credible third-party sources, a biography will violate No original research and Verifiability. But leaving the sarcasm aside, the point I am trying to make is that as long as an editor is trying to use this article as a way to promote an overly antagonistic POV to the subject of the article, this article does not have much of a chance of ever achieving compliance with WP policies. Are we forgetting that is is <b>an encyclopedia</b>? Are we forgetting <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not?</a>. What seems to me inappropriate is the <i>very</i> obvious attempt to advocate under a not so subtle veil of an apparent compliance with content policies. Following the guideline in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_people_78e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living people">Wikipedia:Biographies of living people</a> could be the way out of this problem, as well as an understanding that a WP article cannot be used as a platform to advocate for or against the subject of the article.

<dd>Jossi, your understanding of the policies and guidelines may be different from my own understanding on this matter. Could you please read the "Understanding the Reliable Sources Policy" section and express your opinion there? Of course, I may be mistaken on the matter, but what I would like the parties to understand is that policy does not <i>compel</i> sources to meet some standard, but <i>authorizes</i> editors to remove material if the sources for that material do not meet certain standards. If it is possible for the parties to agree upon what is or is not reputable, then at least some of the disputes could be solved. I don't rule out this possibility. However, there may be another way to approach a solution. If it is accepted that what the parties add, what they delete are based upon their own choices, choices which are permitted by policy, but are not dictated by policy, then there may be room for negotiation. However, as it stands, editors appear to be saying "I can't add that because it is based upon an unreputable source".

<dd>My latest reply was only a tongue in cheek reply.

<dd>Jossi, my main point is that SSB is extremely controversial and there can be little doubt about this. If this is not reflected in the article then it breaks the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> <i>policy</i>, not just a guideline. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is my contention that you are wrong about reliable references. It is also my contention that the critics section, as it is currently written, is not neutrally written and violates a NPOV. That is why we are here. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 21:40, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you please speficy where the critics section violates NPOV (I already know that you disagree with the size)? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:54, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, it is possible to write a rebuttal to the critics and stay within the policy. Why don't you write about the reaction of the typical reaction of Peter Pruzan, as documented in the Danish documentary <i>Seduced</i>? 21:54, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The critics section is filled with personal opinions. The sources you cite are biased (by your own admission). You cite non-reputable/non-notable personal homepages, including your own. You cite non-reputable/non-notable people including Brain Steel, Robert Priddy, Hari Sampath, Said Khorramshahgol and Glen Meloy. You cite non-reputable/non-notable articles written by Alexandra Nagel (ex. Shiva Shakti Article, which has never been cited by reputable sources), citing the gold control article without any reliable and neutral references (court case documents, etc.). The critics section also violates an NPOV by linking all the references to Anti-Sai Sites when they were not originally published on them. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A rebuttal can be made considering that nothing has come from any of these allegations: No court cases, no indictments, nothing. The rebuttals are easy to state and can be made succintly. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> 22:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And by the way, if the article cites Priddy and Steel then it is mainly your fault because you keep reverting to a version that cites Priddy and Steel. I had removed all information only sourced to homepages, but you keep reverting. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:22, 11 February 2006 (UTC)#</dd>

<p>Andries, it was reverted because you kept deleting the devotees and proponents section without a discussion. Also, you should cite from those articles. Just because Nagel managed to get one paper published in a University magazine does not make all of her articles reputable or notable. Just because she had one paper published, you try to include all her opinions and articles. That is deceptive, in my opinion. Everything you say exclusively favors your point of view. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaumaturgic_f593.html" title="User:Thaumaturgic">Thaumaturgic</a> 01:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is completely untrue that I reverted without discussion: I have repeatedly argued that there are two main reasons why that section should be deleted i.e. 1. main organization of the article should be per subject, not per subject, one should not treat the affidavits or Jens Sethi or whatever on two or three different places and 2. Most of the section was sourced only by Moreno's non-notable homepage in violation of several of Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 01:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, you need to show us the reputable media that has pubished these <i>"updated international versions"</i> of Shiva Shakti and A guru accused. You cannot deem what is reputable based on your opinions. You need to reference the published sources, in reputable media, referencing these two articles. So far, the only published paper was "De Sai Paradox". You cannot provide any reputable sources that make reference to the alleged "updated international versions" to the other 2 articles.</p>

<dd>Robert Priddy mentioned Nagel extensively who also published a book published by Premanand who is treated as an expert by the BBC. Again, these article are updated internationalized versions of a peer reviewed article. I think that comes very close to Wikipedia's golden standard and much closer than most of the material. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 02:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The BBC did not call Premanand an "expert" so that is your assumption. Premanand, by his own admission, said he was a critic of SSB since 1968. So he is not neutral. Also, which notable media has referenced Priddy or Premanand's books? Doesn't matter if Priddy referenced Nagel. Priddy's book has not been referenced in notable media. As a matter of fact, neither Priddy's new Anti-Sai book or Premanand's conspiracy theory book are even listed on Amazon.com. Neither of their books are easily obtainable and apparently must be purchased through Premanand, in Podanur India.</dd>

<dd>Andries, show us where the BBC called Premanand an "expert". You are making that assumption. You should not try to state your own personal opinions, but stick to the facts. Where did the BBC call Premanand an "expert"? The BBC was getting the opinion of a self-professed critic of SSB since 1968. And Premanand lied in the BBC as well, but the biased BBC didn't even bother to question him. Probably because they were biased (as even you conceded). And I am insisting on keeping my homepage in the article as long as your homepage is in the article. Remove yours and I will voluntary and immediately remove mine.</dd>

<dd>That is original reseach. If the BBC says "48% of all material written about Baba is controversial", fine. But it doesn't.

<dd>Do you seriously deny that SSB is very controversial? So what if it is original research?

I had already asked you twice to specify where the article breaks the NPOV policy, but you gave no answer.

<dd>Luckily with this mediation taking place, there is a chance to move closer to an ecyclopedic article. The source of all these problems. IMO?

<dd>Jossi, thanks for the explanation. However I think that your objections, regardless whether they are justified or not, with the exception of the complaint about homepages and possibly summary styles are not backed up by guidelines and policies. Post 2000 reputable and scholarly articles have on average a percentage of 48% of criticism so I do not agree with your complaint about undue weight to the critics' POV if you assert that this is backed by guidelines and policy. In relation to that I have yet to see one convincing example of the many scholarly article that you assert were written about SSB. (I am trying to get the 1995 book by Peter van der Veer). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andries, I'm a bit surprised by your statement "so I do not agree with your complaint about undue weight to the critics' POV...". When asked:
<dl>
<dd>"If the main SSB article were neutral and balanced, it would not have more than what percentage of its space devoted to criticisms of SSB?"
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Andries 48.3 %</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Approximately what percentage of the current article would you say is critical?"
<dl>
<dd>Andries I did a word count of the main body of text that has in total 5.978 words. The total amount of words that deal with the criticisms incl. rebuttals, but excl. the sex change is 3.802. This means that the percentage of material that deals with criticism, opposition and controversy is 63%. Even I think that this is too high, thought it was considerable lower before SSS108 and Thaumaturgic insisted on adding rebuttals some of which, but not all are spurious, because solely based on SSS108's homepage.

<dd>As per <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> the issue is not of percentages. Develop each section based on reputable sources, written in an encyclopedic and sympathetic tone of voice as per WP content policies. If a section gets too big, summarize it and spin-off to an article. This would apply to <b>all</b> sections (maybe with the exception of the Biography section as it the main aspect treated.) Note that I have no intention or inclination to reduce the size of <i>any</i> section (pro or con).

<p>Jossi is not an official party to the mediation. At the same time Jossi has been active in the discussions around SSB. (Jossi is also involved in discussions with Andries on other topics). The other parties may welcome Jossi's involvement, or they may or not. I would like the parties to express their opinions regarding what role Jossi ought to play in the mediation if any. I will state up front what I will do with these statements. If anyone states that they do not want Jossi involved in any way, then I will ask Jossi to refrain from participating. If everyone accepts Jossi's participation, but any party expresses the opinion that Jossi ought to be a party to the mediation, I will ask Jossi to be a party to the mediation. If there are other proposals, I will consider them.</p>
<p>Please express your opinions regarding the role Jossi ought to play in this mediation. Please discuss other topics elsewhere. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 04:15, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Andries: Irrelevant as per SSS108. I have had many and intense disagreements with Jossi since he entered Wikipedia. I admit that he in general did good things for Wikipedia and that some of the comments and edits that he made relating to SSB are very sensible. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:36, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have decide to abstain from participating in this mediation from now on. If any party would want my help with sources, or as a sounding board for specific proposals, do not hesitate to drop me a line on my talk page, or send me an email. Good luck, and hope you can find a way forward that works for everybody. I leave you in the capable hands of BostonMA your mediator, from which I have learned a lot about how to handle conflict resolution, by just observing the way he has handled this tricky project so far. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 05:10, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andries, why haven't you answered the questions in mediation? It is coming up on 2 weeks and you adamantly refuse not only to answers the questions in mediation, you adamantly <b>refuse</b> to give any explanation why you refuse to answer the questions in mediation. On your talk page, the mediator reminded you to answer the questions. On your talk page, I asked you to answer the questions. I also kindly asked you to give a reason for not responding. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Andries#Please_respond_to_mediation_questions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Andries#Please_respond_to_mediation_questions" rel="nofollow">Andries Talk Page</a> You refuse to give any answers and choose to stay silent. You promised the mediator that you would answer the questions the past weekend. You did not. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BostonMA#I_will_answer_all_outstanding_questions_this_weekend" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BostonMA#I_will_answer_all_outstanding_questions_this_weekend" rel="nofollow">BostonMA Talk Page</a> It is time for you come forward and state why you refuse to answer the mediation questions. You have lots of time to watch the articles to see who edits them. You have lots of time to revert the articles and make long rebuttals about the Salon.com article. You have lots of time time to make comments. But you have no time for the mediation questions. Why? I would like to know. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 17:37, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>SSS108, I also would like Andries to respond to the open questions. I do not know why he has not yet responded. It may be that he is not feeling well, it may be that he is weighing how to respond, or it may be some other reason. I would like Andries to respond, but I also think it is appropriate for me to offer you (SSS108) some unrequested advice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of your comments have led me to be concerned that you may believe your next step is a request for arbitration. If I have misread the situation, you may ignore the rest of what I am about to say. You may be inclined to believe that the arbitration committee would rule in your favor. The arbitration committee often surprises people. I certainly cannot tell you how such a case would turn out. However, there are a few things that you should consider before embarking on such a course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the arbitration committee accepts a case, they may sanction any or all of the parties involved, including the parties that initiate the case. If an editor has a personal connection with the topic of an article, the arbitration committee may ban that editor from editting that or related articles. They are likely to do so if the editor appears to have an agenda of promoting a particular POV rather than an agenda of promoting the general good of the encyclopdia. You will often hear the term POV-pushing, but "tendentious editting" is the term that seems to be in use in the Arbitration Committee. I recommend that you take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_WebEx_and_Min_Zhu_67fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu">this case</a>, and try to understand why <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenryuzi_af9d.html" title="User:Henryuzi">User:Henryuzi</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/WebEx_and_Min_Zhu#Henryuzi_banned" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/WebEx_and_Min_Zhu#Henryuzi_banned" rel="nofollow">banned</a>]. I offer no opinion on whether ArbCom good or a bad decision. I am only trying to direct your attention to some very real possible outcomes of arbitration. As far as I can tell, ArbCom is little interested in content disputes, and would have no reluctance in sanctioning an editor, even if that editor was "on the right side" of the content dispute. In short, ArbCom may decide to ban <i>you</i>, either instead of, or in addition to, Andries. Whether that would be just or not, it is a possibility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know how ArbCom would address your website. They might take the view that external websites are outside of the things they should consider. However, they might instead decide that your website constitutes incivility or a violation of no personal attacks. I really don't know. However, whether they decide rightly or wrongly, there is little chance for appeal of ArbCom's decisions. (You may appeal to Jimbo, but I have yet to see a successful appeal.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Andries is at times abrasive, and has in my opinion made some errors in judgement, both in regards to the content of various articles, and in regards to policies governing the content. However, in the course of this mediation he has shown a certain willingness to compromise and a certain ability to recognize some of these mistakes and correct them in the course of discussion. He is both a long time and active editor. Arbcom may very well consider all these factors as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To conclude, if you are considering a request for arbitration as your next step, I cannot prevent you from taking that step. However, I think it appropriate for me to warn you that things may not go as you expect. For my part, I think think the next step is to continue to try to work things out through discussion. Sometimes that requires patience. I apologize if anything I have said here is offensive. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 21:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the party that initatied the request for mediation, I would encourage all parties to carefully consider what BostonMA said above. Alot is at stake for both sides, so patience is much recommended and will surely be rewarded. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 23:28, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>BostonMA, I am unaware how the mediation/arbitration process works (this is the first time I have participated in one, or even seen one in action). Honestly, I do not know what the next step is. It is undeniable that Andries behavior has me confused and leads me to suspect that <b>he</b> is the one who is seeking arbitration (after all, <b>he</b> has threatened to request their intervention). I have made <b>no</b> such comments or threats about arbitration and have continually asked Andries to participate in mediation (as can be seen in my numerous comments above). So if you think I am seeking arbitration, you are mistaken. Read the discussion and you will see that the <b>only person</b> who is avoiding mediation and who is threatening to file a request with the arbitration committee is Andries.</p>
<p>If Andries is not feeling well or is too busy to answer the mediation questions, why doesn't he just say so? After <b>repeatedly</b> asking him why he refuses to participate, no answers have been forthcoming. He simply said once, that he was tired on Sunday and Monday and that is why he did not respond. However, Andries recent activity shows he has <b>plenty</b> of time to engage in edits, reverts and arguments, but has no time for mediation.</p>
<p>BostonMA, I have already conceded that my name and website should not be listed on the article. I am only insisting that my website be left in the article until Anti-Sai Websites (including Andries) are removed as well. Let us be clear on that. As a matter of fact, it was Andries who attributed viewpoints to me that were not dependent on me or my website. After Andries started referencing Anti-Sai Sites, Thaumaturgic did the same. When Andries started demanding that personal website references be removed from the site, he shot himself in the foot because this would mean he would have to remove his personal website references as well. He is unwilling to remove Anti-Sai website references (including his own), so I am unwilling to remove mine. I have shown, in word and deed, my commitment to the mediation process. I have not made any comments about arbitration (unlike Andries). I do not know how this standstill is to be resolved and that is why I made a complaint to <b>you</b>, not the arbitration committee. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 00:36, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi SSB, thanks for your comments. As I mentioned, I did not know your state of mind or your plans. My worries were sparked by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=42683020&amp;oldid=42681937" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=42683020&amp;oldid=42681937" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, however, I am pleased to learn that my worries regarding its meaning are unfounded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It of course is entirely possible that Andries wants to go to arbitration. I don't know. He did mention that with regards to the "boys" issue. I would give him the same advice i.e. ArbCom, if it hears the matter, won't stop at the question of whether "boys" should be included in the SSB article. I think that would be one of their least concerns actually.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue with your website is not merely that a link to it appears in the SSB article, but that Andries is mentioned by name and is subject to a rather severe criticism (for example on <a href="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/sathya-sai-baba-wikipedia-bias.html" class="external text" title="http://www.saisathyasai.com/baba/Ex-Baba.com/sathya-sai-baba-wikipedia-bias.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>). If you had written the same things in a talk page, I think there is a strong likelihood that an admin would have blocked you for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. However, these comments about Andries are <i>not</i> on a Wikipedia talk page, but on your website to which there is a link from the SSB article. That raises the question of whether this is or is not prohibited by <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. I really don't know the answer to that. It is something we will discuss if we continue mediation. It is even more unclear to me what attitude ArbCom might take on such a matter. The point of bringing it up was to draw your attention to the fact that a request for arbitration could easily backfire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I apologize if my worries came accross as beliefs. However, as time passed, I became increasingly concerned that some action might be taken with unforseen consequences. I wanted to clarify what some of those consequences might be in order to forstall uninformed action. It was not my intent for it to sound accusatory, but I can see how it might come accoss that way, and I apologize for that. I do appreciate your willingness to continue mediation. Sincerely. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 01:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BostonMA, once the wikipedia article for SSB is neutral and fair, that page will definitely be updated. That page was started a while back when I decided I could no longer participate in editing the article due to the fact that nothing I submitted was accepted. Therefore, I gave voice to what I considered systematic bias from Andries (an Anti-Sai Activist who, at that time, was claiming to be the webmaster to the largest Anti-Sai Site on the net). It is also important to point out that I had requested mediation at the time and nothing came out from it. Also, nothing on my page about Andries is incorrect. All my comments, in my opinion, are fully backed up and expose what I see as Andries systematic bias (even though he claims to be neutral enough to edit this article). My page about him proves he is not neutral and cannot edit this article neutrally. Andries has had many months to challenge my page. He has not done so. However, since you brought this up, I will remove the links from my talk and personal wiki pages. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 02:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I answered today all outstanding questions by BostonMA except the ones about the inuendo that the Indian Skeptic used. I do not understand the article in the Indian Skeptic very well and the questions by BostonMA about the inuendo in the Indian Skeptic do not seem urgent, because only very remotely related to the current state of the article. Nevertheless, I will answer these questions too, hopefully this weekend. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 14:23, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BostonMA, it is you who decides whether this article, or specific disputes about this article, or the behavior of editors of this article are referred to the Arbitration committee. The arbcom will accept cases only if they have been unsuccessfully mediated. It will be clear that I am completely fed up by the behavior of SSS108 who seems unable to understand or unwilling to follow basic Wikipedia policies which is clear from his repeated removal of the word "boys" that is well sourced and referenced to salon.com. Other reputable sources for the word boys are the Danish TV documentary "Seduced" (that mentions the word "pedophile") and the UNESCO press release (that mentions the word "minor"). Can you please give this dispute a high priority in the mediation? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 15:59, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Just an FYI to everyone. Anyone may file a request for arbitration at any time. The arbitration committee may vote not to hear a case, and are likely to do so if other attempts at dispute resolution have not been made. Even if mediation is in progress, a party may file a request for mediation. The party might claim that the mediator is biased, that the mediator does not understand the issues, or any number of reasons why the party believes that mediation is or has failed. The arbitration committee may or may not find such arguments convincing. I am not recommending that anyone file a request for arbitration. Nor do I think this is a terribly important point. However, I think it appropriate to set the record straight, as far as I see it. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 00:31, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amazing how Andries does <b>not</b> understand the Indian Skeptic article, written in English, but has no problem trying to reference it as a source against SSB. Whether or not Premanand used innuendo is highly relevant and a very important question. Our answers to this question give insights into our ideas on what constitutes fair, neutral and factual data. In my opinion, this question is one of the most important questions asked. Almost 2 weeks later, Andries says he doesn't understand it. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 19:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know the background of that particular article in the Indian Skeptic and I hardly know any names in it. I never used that particular article as a reference for this article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:57, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The particular article refers to a number of letters, such as a letter written to the Supreme Court of India. I believe that those letters are in the same issue of <b>Indian Skeptic</b> as the article in question. I hope that helps you understand the details.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The issue for me is this. Suggesting that a someone ought to be investiaged for possible criminal behavior is suggesting that there is reason to believe that the person involved did in fact commit a crime. However, making a suggestion that there should be an investigation allows the party that makes the suggestion to deny that they have in fact made any claims or accusations, and technically such a denial would be accurate. It is technically possible for a journal to adhere to the motto "exceptional claims require exceptional proof" while simultaneously casting unfounded aspersions at someone, if that journal uses the technique of "calling for investigations". Now a journal which engages in such a practice, but does not provide any credible evidence that a crime has actually been committed is not a journal that I would describe as non-partisan. Nor do I believe that most people would be indifferent to the prospect of such a journal writing a negative article about themselves.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of reasons why I think it would be useful for you to answer the open questions about <b>Indian Skeptic</b>. There is one reason, however, that I think deserves special attention. There are many possible reasons why you may not have answered the questions. One possible reason is this. After I raised these questions, you may have recognized that <b>Indian Skeptic</b> is in fact partisan, and is in fact not the sort of publication to which most people would be indifferent with regards to the prospect of a negative journal. This would be in contrast with your previously stated positions regarding <b>Indian Skeptic</b>. However, rather than admit that your previous statements were in error, you are being less than straightforward. This is only a possibility, and there are other possibilities. I am not saying that the possibility above is what has actually happened. However, <i>if</i> you were to be less than straightforward during mediation, that would make the mediation much more difficult and possibly much less fruitful. For that reason, everyone has a strong interest in knowing whether you intend to be straightforward in the mediation. That, I think, should provide a strong motivation for you to answer the questions, even if you think the questions in themselves are not that important, or even moot. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 00:31, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, I have reasons for my all my comments about you. On Wikipedia, others share my sentiments about you as well. Premanand is cited on your Anti-Sai Site. Premanand is cited on your friend's Anti-Sai Sites. You actively defend Premanand. You actively defend Premanand's anonymous <i>"Betrayal"</i> letter (despite never researching it). You actively defend Premanand's <i>"Gold Control Act"</i>, despite it never being published, in full, on the internet. You actively defend everything against SSB and raise a huge wail when it comes to including favorable material. Your actions and words have influenced my perception of you. The questions are really simple: Did Premanand use innuendo? Did Premanand factually prove that SSB influenced the judiciary? Yes or no? <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 22:03, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, it does not matter if Moreno thinks that the article has a bias. What matters is that a reputable source i.e. <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> uses the word "boys" for the victims of sexual abuse by SSB. The article by Goldberg in salon.com article is not an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editorial.html" title="Editorial">oped</a>. Goldberg was in the ashram and talked with the people there and also with ex-devotees and she reported about this in her article. And even it is an oped then I cannot see any implications for the article. It is a reputable sources that stated that SSB was accused of sexual abuse of "boys" and that accusation stated as an accusation (not as a fact) can and should go in the article. I have no intention to discuss this any longer with SSS108, because this is a clear-cut case, unlike most other disputes with SSS108. I am sure that SSS108 has sincere doubts about the inclusion of the word "boys", but these doubts are not justified by policies of Wikipedia. It is not my duty to teach SSS108 the basics of Wikipedia again and again. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 07:59, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, how do you know the article is not an op-ed? You told Jossie that you weren't even going to check! It doesn't matter if Goldberg was at the ashram or not. Her entire article was slanted against SSB and she told Glen Meloy that she wrote the article hoping to bring attention to his cause. I am objecting to the wording, not the reputability of salon.com. Goldberg did not investigate any cases of "boys" being abused. She simply repeated that claim, as made by Anti-Sai Activists. This hardly qualifies her as a source for supporting the claim that SSB sexually abused "boys". You tenaciously hold on to Goldberg and Premanand to make your case that SSB is alleged to have abused "boys", yet you lack any solid references that SSB did abuse "boys". Not even one testimony from a child or a parent of a child. Not even one reputable source that ever privately investigated it and was willing to make that claim. Not even one! You are drawing inferences from comments. Goldberg <b>never</b> claimed that SSB did sexually abuse boys. She said Anti-Sai's believed that. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 19:17, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let us look at Michelle Goldberg's references to <i>"boys"</i>, since Andries is obviously failing to understand my POV: Only 4 references to "boys":<a href="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2001/07/25/baba/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2001/07/25/baba/index.html" rel="nofollow">Salon.com Article Written By Michelle Goldberg</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>REF 1: <i>"All this helps explain why there has never been any official action against Sai Baba in India, despite the dozens of ex-believers who insist that his claims to divinity mask a wholly human craving for the bodies of the ashram's young men and boys."</i> ("boys" used in relation to claims made by ex-believers)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>REF 2: <i>"American Jed Geyerhahn, who was 16 when Sai Baba started coming on to him, echoes de Kraker's account: "Each time I saw Baba, his hand would gradually make more prominent connections to my groin." The stories are endless, and endlessly alike, concerning mostly boys and men from their midteens to their mid-20s."</i> (Where are the "endless" stories documented? Age range is also referenced.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>REF 3: <i>During his time at Prasanthi Nilayam, he said, many students at the ashram's college told him they were pressured to have sex with the guru. "I've spoken to 20 or 30 boys who have been abused, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are 14-year-old kids made to live in his room and made to think it's a blessing. In most cases, their parents have been followers for 20 years and are not going to believe them," Sampath said by phone from Chicago.</i> (comment about "boys" came from Hari Sampath)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>REF 4: <i>Sampath also wants the American government to intervene, on the grounds that "American citizens have been knowing about this abuse and taking American boys to Puttaparthi and feeding them to him.</i> (comment about "boys" came from Hari Sampath)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Michelle Goldberg did not document <b>any</b> cases of <i>"boys"</i> being abused. "Males", yes. She repeated the stories told to her to Geyerhan and Sampath. Goldberg's talk about the <i>"stories being endless"</i> is her personal bias that she admitted when writing the article to bring attention to Glen Meloy's "struggle". It is clear that the word <i>"boys"</i> refers to gender (not age-wise as "boys" is a term for a child 12 years of age or younger) as she specifically followed her comment by saying <i>"mid-teens to their mid-20s"</i>. Hari Sampath also boasted to Brian Steel that he was responsible for the Salon.com article. Michelle did not document any cases of boys being abused, so if you insist on using that word, this fact must be mentioned as well as the age range she gave. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 06:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia editors are not supposed to assess into detail whether reputable sources had good reasons to write what they wrote before including it in the article. Of course we can agree to exclude certain sources if we all think they are flawed, e.g. the New York Times article <i>A Friend in India to all the World</i> makes blunders when writing about SSB (e.g. "famous for not saying much in public") and I think that we all agree that we do not want certain statements of the NYT article in Wikipedia. In this case there is no good reason to exclude the salon.com source.

<p>Andries, this is exactly the problem with you. Michelle Goldberg expressed her opinions and gave the Salon.com her slant and bias and you see absolutely nothing wrong in citing the article because it is "notable". Once it comes to a slant and bias in <b>favor</b> of SSB, from the "notable" New York Times, you start saying we must <b>exclude</b> it. There is your bias and double-standards in action, out of your own mouth. If Goldberg and her bias are allowed to be cited, then I see no reason why Keith Bradsher and his bias cannot similary be cited. The New York Times is even more "notable" than Salon.com. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 02:29, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The alleged <i>"blunders"</i> are your perception of them. Keith Bradsher's article is going to be cited. Despite your own admission that Tanya Datta and Michelle Goldberg was biased and favored Anti-Sai Activists, you continually say that their bias can be cited as a <i>"fact"</i> because it was published in notable and reputable sources. Using your own logic, it doesn't matter if Keith Bradsher made alleged <i>"blunders"</i> or not, since it was published in a notable and reputable source, it can be stated as a <i>"fact"</i>.

<dd>SSS108, Andries has stated his intention of deleting certain material unless reputable sources are provided. I do not know if you care whether that material is deleted.

<dl>
<dd>BostonMA, I am objecting to the way the Trouw article is being used. It is being used as a source to prove that there was some sort of mass defection from SSB. Whomever wrote <i>"Hundreds of Dutch devotees did the same tearing up all the Sai Baba photos off the walls and throwing out his books"</i> didn't document it. It is an unsubstantiated and subjective claim. This is hardly reliable information that factually documents that hundreds of devotees <b>did</b> defect from SSB. Andries is using that article as proof that there was some sort of mass defection. Also, I object to the translation. It was translated by a critic of SSB and even Andries said the translation was poor. The English translation indicates that there is a definite slant to it, judging from the use of parenthesis that seem to have been added by the translator. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 16:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since Andries has not made an argument against mine, I surmise he doesn't have one. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 17:51, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that 48 hours is sufficient notice to make changes. Giving advance notice shows good faith and and an effort to avoid edit wars. However, I do not think that it is a safe assumption that merely because an editor has not responded within the 48 hours, that the editor in question will not make a response after the edit has been made. I have no problem with you proceding as you have done, i.e. giving notice of proposed edits, and then, in the absense of objections, making those changes. I think it would be fair to ask Andries to do the same, that is, if he wishes to undo a change for which you have given 48 hours notice, and for which he has given no response, then he should also give 48 hours before making his reversion. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 18:10, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In contrast to what SSS108 states here, I did make an argument against SSS108's dismissal of the Trouw article as a reputable source. Read the talk page at <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESathya_Sai_Baba_317d.html" title="Talk:Sathya Sai Baba">talk:Sathya Sai Baba</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:28, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not objecting to the reputability of the Trouw article. I am objecting to the way it is being used. Its use is deceitful, in my opinion, for the reasons just stated earlier. It does not factually document anything. So I believe it cannot be used as a reference for factual data. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 19:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouw.html" title="Trouw">Trouw</a> newspaper was right that there was a significant defection from the SSB movement in the Netherlands. Another source (local Dutch Newspaper) that stated the same is here <a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/witnesses/frameset.html?page=stijn" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.hetnet.nl/~ex-baba/engels/witnesses/frameset.html?page=stijn" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> "<i>With some success, because the following of the Indian guru last year has diminished. Of the about 2800 subscribers to the Dutch Sai Baba Newsletter, 800 have cancelled their subscription, partly because Riemersma distributes The Findings in the Netherlands.</i>" <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:18, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BostonMA, please do not do any effort to determine the reputability of Beyerstein's study published in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_CSICOP_51f0.html" title="Indian CSICOP">Indian CSICOP</a>. The reason is that it is easy to bypass a direct treatment of this study by using Nagel's 1994 article published by the Free University of Amsterdam that has already been determined as a reputable source and that refers to this study. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:42, 2 April 2006 (UTC) (amended for grammar)</p>
