<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosco_Adventure_817f.html" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>
<p>The story is about a young elvish princess Apricot (アプリコット ひめ) whose mission is to return to her home - Fountain land, occupied by evil forces of a monster called Scorpion (スコーピオン), before the total eclipse of the Sun. If she manages to sit on a throne before the eclipse, she'll release a great power of water that will destroy the occupators. To prevent that from happening, she's been kidnapped by mysterious cloacked man called Hoodman (フードマン), and his, rather clumsy, aides: Jack (ジャック) and Franz (フランツ). Their mission is to keep princess away from her home land until the eclipse. In the first episode, she escapes from the villains by sending a message by her trusty mechanical bird Speak (スピーク). The princess's urgent call for help is accidentally heard by habitants of Bosco forest: brave and adventurous Frog (フローク), intelligent and ingenious inventor Tutty (スピーク), and cowardly, but kind and warm-hearted Otter (オッター). They save her from the villains, and the princess becomes a part of Bosco crew. Guys decide to help Apricot finding her way back home, before it's too late. On their way to Fountain land they get into myriad of adventures, where they prove their desire and ability to help and protect those who are in need, and where their own relationships between each other flourish and develop into strong friendship and love.</p>

<dd>Kind, generous, friendly, mild elvish princess whose mission is to return back home to Fountain land before the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_eclipse.html" title="Total eclipse">total eclipse</a> of the Sun. Her parents were killed by a monster Scorpion that occupied her homeland. Aboard the Bosco ship she is at first respected as a real princess, but being humble and everything but egocentric, she made clear that she doesn't want guys to call her Princess Apricot, but Apri, a short and convenient nick name which they'll start to use in the first episodes until the end. She is the one that encourages friends to help others in trouble, even though it delays her progress. And often, she notices beautiful sceneries such as flowers, meadows, etc. Her character adds a softer and feminine side to the rest of the crew. She is always ready to help with everything aboard Bosco, and regularly helps Frog with every problem. Apricot and Frog's relationship develops in different way then with Tutty and Otter. As the story goes on, romantic elements are combined with strong connection to each other, from the first contact on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deltaplane.html" title="Deltaplane">deltaplane</a>, to the very end.</dd>
<dt>Frog <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">フローク</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Frog</span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span></dt>
<dd>Brave, adventurous, strong, skilled, clever, a young habitant of a Bosco forest. Leader of the Bosco crew (even though he denies it). Good friend with Tutty and Otter. Throughout the episodes, he often fights with Tutty because of the opposite opinions and ideas. Apricot is the one who calms them down. Often explores the surrounding with <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binoculars.html" title="Binoculars">binoculars</a>, drives the ship in dangerous situations, etc. Gains strong feelings for Apricot.</dd>
<dt>Tutty <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">スピーク</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Tutty</span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span></dt>
<dd>Ingenious, smart, intelligent, Tutty is behind every move of Bosco crew. He is the one who invents all machines: jet-pack, accessorising vehicles, and even the Bosco ship, which was used as a house before the saving of princess. Fights often with Frog. Always fixes something on his table, even fixed and upgraged Speak so he can communicate with others. Always has the right idea in the right time.</dd>
<dt>Otter <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">オッター</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Otter</span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span></dt>

<dd>A bit cowardly and shy, but knows how to be very useful in the same time. He is the engineer of the Bosco ship, as he lights the fire and keeps it strong so that Bosco can travel. Spends most of the time in the loft. Hangs most of the time with Tutty, and also helps Frog and Apricot with everything. He's a good cook too.</dd>
<dt>Speak <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">スピーク</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Speak</span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span></dt>
<dd>Apricot's mechanical bird, looks a lot like a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toucan.html" title="Toucan">toucan</a>, but actually resembles to parrot, because he repeats words spoken to him. Tutty first fixed him, after he was hit by a lighting (Otter found him), to hear Apricot's message, and second time to the point where he could communicate with others. Very close to Apricot. He doesn't appear in episodes 04, 05, 06, 07, 11, 14, 16, 20.</dd>

<dd>A noble man from Fountain land, appears in episodes 13-21, and in 26, so he's not in the regular cast. He carried the message to the Apricot and informed her more about her quest. He couldn't get on well with the rest of the crew at the beginning (he couldn't understand how they called her Apri instead of Apricot!), but the tensions cooled as the story moved on, and he helped the guys in many ways.</dd>

<dd>Wise owl of the Bosco forest. Appears in the first episode when Otter asks him for help with Speak.

<dd>Cloacked man, dressed in black, mercenary of Scorpion. Leader of big air ship called Scorpion, and the boss of Jack and Franz. After he loses Apricot in the first episode, he never gets the full control of her again. Haunts the Bosco ship from episode to episode, what actually keeps the story interesting. In the beginning we see him as a fierce, strong and scary leader, but as the story moves on he becomes more euphoric, stressed and devastated, mainly because of his incompetents aides and the intervention of Damia later in the series.

<dd>Perhaps the most impressive character of the series, young, beautiful, angry and dangerous woman. Right hand of Scorpion, possesses a private army. Her first appearance is in episode 15, although she actually appears earlier, in episode 13, but for a short time. She is sent as the replacement for Hoodman, his back up precisely. Makes Bosco's progress harder, but in the same time a lot easier, since she fights also with Hoodman from time to time. Loyal to Scorpion, as he promised her half of the world after she deals with Apricot.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Princess Apricot with her loyal bird Speak is kidnapped in Hoodman's ship Scorpion. She manages to send a cry for help by Speak, but a thunderbolt hits him. Next morning, Otter finds the bird and brings him to his friend Tutty who fixes him and the crew hears princess' message. Tutty's house is actually a flying ship, so the crew transform it and fly to help the princess, with Speak guiding their way. Two ships meet on open-air territory and princess manages to jump from the Scorpion. Luckily, Frog saves her with a deltaplane. Princess tells them her story, and they agree to return her to her home, Fountain land.</dd>

<p>2. <b>"Nemureru kyojin wo okosuna!"</b> (眠れる巨人を起こすな！)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Princess is having a dream about her throne disappearing. Later, crew sees in the distance the Sleepy Giant's mountain (ねむれる きょじん の やま), as Hoodman starts catapulting the Bosco ship. Two ships get carried by a storm, and Bosco starts drifting down the mountain. At one point, ship falls above the sleeping Giant, only held by an anchor to the rock above. Bosco crew fixes the damage while trying not to wake up the sleeping one. Hoodman finds the ship and starts attacking it. Frog throws ashes in Giant's face which makes him cough and blow away the Bosco ship. Angry Giant then throws a huge rock at Scorpion. Bosco reaches Dragon's valley (ドラゴン だに).</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. <b>"Doragon-dani ha kiken ga ippai"</b> (ドラゴン谷は危険がいっぱい)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jack and Franz stole Dragon's baby. The Bosco crew lands in the village and shortly after continues their travel. But not too far away, the Dragon starts attacking them, believing they have her baby. She does some damage to the ship but they manage to run away by turning on the turbo speed system which made the ship go very fast. They crash in a tree near the village. The people from the village welcome them again. That night Hoodman flies over the village and demands the princess in exchange for the little dragon. Apricot feels guilty about it. Tomorrow, Dragon starts destroying the village searching for her baby. Apricot manages to talk quietly with her and she goes away. Tutty upgrades Speak so he can communicate with others.

<dl>
<dd>Apricot dreams again, this time about her mother calling her. She wakes up hearing Dragon crying for her son. After the guys repaired the ship, Apricot "borrows" the Tutty's hovercraft, as she feels guilty about the situation in the village. She manages to go to the Northern Swamp, where is the Hoodman's hideout. Hovercraft stops working as she climbs aboard the ship. Hoodman ties her with the little dragon. In the meantime, guys have realized that Apricot is missing and they start the ship to look out for her. Back in Scorpion, Apricot finds out that little Dragon blows fire if kissed, so she uses that technique to get them both free. Then, they take Tutty's jetpack, which Jack and Franz have stollen in the first episode. As Bosco and Scorpion approach one another, princess jumps off the ship with little Dragon and the jetpack. Soon after that, Dragon comes and burns the Scorpion, while Apricot jumps to Bosco ship. Friends say good-bye to people from village and dragons, with Apricot promising that they will see each other again.</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. <b>"Hikaru kinoko wo te ni irero!"</b> (光るキノコを手に入れろ！)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hoodman has got Bosco ship on fire, demanding that they give away the princess. Frog and Tutty start fighting, because they ran out of wood, and the only source are planks from the Bosco ship, but Tutty is against doing that, since they are basically tearing down the ship. After turning on the ventilation system, Bosco ship lands onto river, with Tutty falling in water because of the high impact. At Scorpion, the Messenger (his debúte) brings message to Hoodman from their master, who reminds him of his quest. Then, he orders Jack and Franz to bring him cold water from the river. Tutty has a strange fever, so Apricot and Frog go to find some cure for him. In talk with villagers (with Jack and Franz eavesdropping, also looking out for herbs since they master also got sick) they find out that the water from the river is poisonous, so that made Tutty and Hoodman sick. Villagers say that only shiny mushrooms growing in the depths of Castle of Evil, an infamous and dangerous place, can cure them. Apricot and Frog construct special vehicle and set out to find the shiny mushrooms. Hoodman and his aides are also in the race for the shiny cure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>6. <b>"Dai ma kyuu no deddohi-to"</b> (代魔宮のデッドヒート)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apricot and Frog have numerous deadly adventures in the Castle's depths, with Hoodman and his aides on their trail. After great number of obstacles, the paths of two opponents split up, with Apricot and Frog getting the mushrooms first, because Hoodman's vehicle has fallen in the poisonous water, just in front of the mushrooms site. While getting the mushrooms, Frog accidentally triggers the mechanism that stops the pouring of the black water (which made the river poisonous in the first place). Apricot insists on giving the mushrooms to Hoodman, Jack and Franz, since they got poisoned with water after their vehicle fell in it. Unwillingly, Frog listens to her and they feed the bad guys with shiny mushrooms.</dd>
</dl>
<p>7. <b>"Apurikotto hime kikiippatsu"</b> (アプリコット姫　危機一髪)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apricot's merciness wasn't accepted in a good way, as Hoodman kidnaps her and throws Frog into the water. Frog is saved by Otter, after the river brought him back to Bosco ship. They cure Tutty, and start the ship, going in the cave to save the princess. In the meantime, Apricot was running from the villains through underground caves. After they saved her, friends continue their travel, with Tutty and Frog becoming friends again.</dd>

<p>8. <b>"Fu-doman no okashi na majikku"</b> (フードマンのおかしなマジック)</p>

<dd>Friends reach the desert. Messenger gives the idea to Hoodman how to catch the princess and the crew. There is a mechanism that stops the water of Oasis, diversing it into another direction. Hoodman uses it to cheat the people of Oasis how he is a great prophet, and that he can make the water disappear. He says that the ship which will soon land there is full of devils and that they need to be imprisoned. Bosco lands soon after the Hoodman's fraud, and the people from Oasis imprison them, but not Otter - as he managed to stay inside the ship, in the loft. In the evening, he disguised himself and went to help his friends, being kept in the Oasis' dungeon. He finds the big bag full of water, which Hoodman plans to use in his further "magic tricks". Jack and Franz meet Otter, who luckily escapes from them. Hoodman gives to order to everyone in Oasis to capture the remaining devil.</dd>

<dd>Though he had a good intention, Otter also gets imprisoned. But luckily, friends dig a hole in the wall, allowing the diverse water to fill the room. As the level of water was rising, they were digging a hole in the ceiling. In the same time, Hoodman was trying to keep the people of Oasis still to believe him, so he gave them water from the bag, but appearing as he forced the spring site. The citizens discover his fraud, as blast of water sets Bosco crew free. Leon, the guardian of Oasis, and his apprentice, Leon, gave the legendary treasure, a map to Fountain land, to Apricot. The friends fly further.</dd>

Afterwards, Bosco crashes on a mysterious island, guarded by strong sea and wind currents. Apricot falls unconscious from the collision. Frog goes to explore the island, while Tutty and Otter go to find some medicine for Apricot. During that time, Unicorn kidnaps the princess (as Messenger promised him that Hoodman will take him away from this island if he obeys). Hoodman also reaches the other side of the island, to get the princess.</dd>
</dl>
<p>11. <b>"Zuuzuushii Yuniko-n"</b> (ずうずうしいユニコーン)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apricot escapes from the villains, while Tutty has an idea to use the Scorpion as counterbalance to raise the Bosco. Hoodman has the same idea, and he uses the Unicorn as his servant. When Unicorn gets trapped in cleft stick, Hoodman leaves him there. But, Apricot and Frog save him, wrapping his leg with Frog's scarf. Afterwards, both ships try to take off, using one another. Bosco gets stuck in cliffs, but Unicorn bravely separates the ship. He starts falling down, but with Apricot's words of encouragement he uses his wings and starts flying. Feeling grateful to friends, he explains that his family left him here to get independent. Rising currents raised the Bosco ship, so Frog cut the rope connecting two ships, resulting in Scorpion's crashing on the other side. Unicorn's relatives come for him, because he is now a grown up man. Apricot gives her scarf to Frog.</dd>

<p>12. <b>"Kootta mura wo sukue! Setsugen no daitsuiseki"</b> (凍った村を救え！・雪原の大追跡)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hoodman frozes a mountain windmill that was sending warm wind to a mountain village, resulting in no snow. Bosco reaches the village, already full of snow, and one family accepts them. Frog, Tutty and Otter go to check the windmill, while Hoodman throws a huge snowball on the family's house, trapping the princess and the girl inside. Apricots starts to freeze slowly. In the meantime, guys manage to bring the windmill in its previous state. Speak informs guys about Apricot, and they rush back to save her. Jack and Franz interrupt them in their way down to the village. In the end, they save once again Apricot from the bad guys.</dd>

They continue the discussion that they began the night before on lake, but Hoodman captures Frog and serves him to Ogja. But, Tutty and Ender save the princess and Frog in the last moment. The four use one of the catapults of the lizards to return to Bosco. Apricot says to Frog that she will never forget him and this voyage.</dd>

They agree to help Hoodman but only if he agrees on allowing them to catch the Damia with him. Treacherous Hoodman says yes, but after the friends help them with repairments, Jack and Franz tie them up. Princess and Ender manage to jump from Bosco, into the Sleeping forest (ねむりのもり) - forest full of stone statues. Damia orders her soldiers to catch them. Meanwhile, Hoodman attacks Damia. She manages to return one rocket and Scorpion falls to the ground. Then her soldiers, with help of Hoodman and Jack and Franz, construct a platform with the ending in special liquid that turns human beings into those rock statues. First comes Ender. Then comes Apricot. Tutty follows, but because of his shell he manages to jump across the kettle, and grab the statue of the princess. Using the opportunity, Frog and Otter throw Damia's soldiers into the kettle and pour some over the Hoodman, Jack and Franz. They take off with Bosco, and grab Damia's antidote and sparkle it all over the Sleeping forest, turning all the statues back into life. Friends heal Apricot, and take a small pic-nic, keeping Ender as a statue for a little while.</dd>

Hoodman attacks Bosco with the same bombs he attacked them with when they drifted on ocean. Friends decide to pull the ship deeper into the forest, using ropes and Bosco's landing wheels. After seeing that their bombs explode too early, Hoodman decides to lower his ship down a bit, even though Franz warns them that the forest is rather thick, so they could crash into a tree. Scorpion eventually crashes into woods. Friends board the ship. Aboard ship, Ender manages to make friends believe that Frog works secretly for Damia, so Tutty and Otter tie him up and lock him beneath the ship. Bosco approaches a mountain lake. Driving through thick fog, friends don't notice that a huge spiderweb is ahead them, so they get into it. A huge spider-like machine rises from lake and starts climbing the web. Ender is actually Damia, disguised as him! She kidnaps Apricot and takes her to the vehicle, controlled by her trusty friend Nicola. Tutty and Otter untie Frog and he tries to save Apricot. Hoodman approaches, too, and starts attacking Damia. Hoodman's ship eventually crashes, previously setting Bosco free from the web, which lands undamaged onto shore.

<dd>Apricot surrendered herself to Hoodman. Frog catches the ship and remains hidden until they reach Fountainland. Then he hides in the boxes which are a present for His Majesty from Hoodman. Damia takes control of the princess and brings her to His Majesty. He tells her he is a monster who eats other planets. This one he started to dry out because he hated water. Princess cried and said that tomorrow she will bring the water back, but His Majesty turned into a horrible creature; a Scorpion! He attacked her, but Frog managed to reach the throne room and save her. They both get lost in the labyrinth beneath the castle. Hoodman and his aides saw the real face of His Majesty, and they ran away. Damia is confused; she is not sure if she can trust His Majesty any more. She meets with Frog and Apricot but Hoodman gets in her way so she loses them. Scorpion tells her that they will get killed in the depths anyhow. Tutty and Otto reach Fountainland. Less than twenty hours remain to the total eclipse. Apricot and Frog are surrounded by the black servants of Scorpion.</dd>

<dd>Tutty and Otto reach the Fountainland and land near the temple. Running from black worms Apricot and Frog get deeper into the caves. Scorpion tells Damia that he will take care of Apricot and Frog. Tutty and Otto get captured by Hoodman. But, they manage to trick him in taking them down beneath the castle - Tutty tells him that there is a hidden gold in the depths of Fountainland. Apricot and Frog find a secret mine where villagers from the town are working like slaves to burry the Well of Life. By that time Speak gathered all creatures from Fountainland, Bosco forest and other good guys and started a rebellion. Damia isn't sending her soldiers to help Scorpion's, she isn't sure yet what are his plans. Hoodman reached the Well of Life after falling with his aides through a hole. Otto and Tutty (who has tied ropes to pillars to remember the way back) also made it to the Well. Hoodman started a rebellion there between the workers. They attacked the soldiers and run away to help the other ones who are fighting outside. Apricot, Frog, Tutty and Otter led the group inside. There are only ten minutes left until the eclipse.</dd>

<dd>The stone pillar raises and Apricot starts climbing it. His Majesty turns into the Scorpion once again. Damia flees, for now. Frog attacks the Scorpion and grabs one of his scales, but Scorpion knocks him down. Apricot continues climbing the pillar. Damia takes the Scorpion ship and her soldiers and start attacking the monster. The monster destroys the ship and kills most of the soldiers. Damia survives. Tutty and Otto move the Bosco ship closer to Frog and lower him a rope. Scorpion knocks the princess down to the half of the pillar. But Ender appears and gives her back the strength to go on! Frog continues attacking the monster. The big Dragon comes and helps Frog to stop the Scorpion. Apricot finally climbs the throne. The beams raise her from the pillar. She gives Frog her necklace. The water emerges and Hoodman and his aides run away from the Well. Apricot is levitating on the top of the water pillar. The Fountainland transforms back in its original look. Bosco lands. Speak tries to touch the princess but the energy throws him back. He becomes a living bird, not a robot anymore. The water descends and the princess disappear. But, she return just for a moment to say good-bye to her friends... The water kills the black worms. Hoodman, Jack, Franz, Damia and the messenger start searching for a new life. Ender says that Frog, Tutty and Otter are the knights of Fountainland. Everyone returns to their homes, and all animals from Bosco forest set off to a long journey back. During the flight, princess Apricot appears for the last time to say to the crew that she will always be with them.</dd>

<p>Background music in Bosco Adventure episodes is colorful, moody, nostalgic, sentimental, with characteristical Japanese sounds. It has variety of cues, for every situation and place which crew visits (Sleeping Giant, Oasis, Ocean...). Several cues repeat throughout the episodes, depending on the situation. Songs that were released on Bonus Disc as a part of DVD are: Tokimeki wa Forever (ときめきはForever, opening song, sung by Noriko Hidaka), Hareta hi nimo ai wo kudasai (はれたひにもあいをください, closing song, also sung by Noriko Hidaka), Kara Kara Makkura (カラカラまっくら, sung by voice actors that gave voice to Hoodman, Jack and Franz) and Bosco Adventure (ボスコアドベンチャー, sung by voice actors that gave voice to Apricot, Frog, Tutty and Otter).</p>
