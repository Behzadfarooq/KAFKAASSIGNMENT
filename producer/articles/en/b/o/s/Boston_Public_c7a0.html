<p>At the beginning, <i>Boston Public</i> preceded <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally_McBeal_40ca.html" title="Ally McBeal">Ally McBeal</a></i> on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday.html" title="Monday">Monday</a> nights and received initial popularity and critical acclaim for its drama and ethnically diverse cast. However, the series had a hard time finding a direction or an audience. It was generally felt that the important 18-to-24 year-old demographic would not be interested in a drama about high school teachers, so attempts were made to focus more on the lives of high school students; however, this only caused critics to accuse it of copycatting. These problems, along with bizarre storylines and casting changes, caused the show's ratings to decline. The final nail in the coffin was when <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> moved <i>Boston Public</i> to the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_night_death_slot.html" title="Friday night death slot">Friday night death slot</a> for its fourth (and ultimately, final) season. The number of viewers plummeted accordingly, and <i>Boston Public</i> was cancelled after a truncated fourth season.</p>
<p>The last episode to air in its normal timeslot was on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. The final two episodes aired over a year later in syndication on <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_One_%28Radio_One%29_d48f.html" title="TV One (Radio One)">TV One</a>. Neither episode wrapped up any of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_arc.html" title="Character arc">character arcs</a> as the series was cancelled in the middle of its fourth season.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Public_c7a0.html" title="Edit section: Social soapbox">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social soapbox</span></h2>
<p><i>Boston Public</i> often served as a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a> about various contemporary issues. In the tradition of series such as <i><a href="../../../p/i/c/Picket_Fences_e28b.html" title="Picket Fences">Picket Fences</a></i>, the show often intertwined a social issue in context of the lives of the characters, and approaching it through discourse between the characters and developments in the storyline that were meant to be reflective of particular sides of the issue. The title of each episode was a numbered chapter, similar to that in a high school textbook, and each character had a certain <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_arc.html" title="Story arc">story arc</a>, with the professional and personal lives often intersecting with the issue at hand. The particular issues tackled by the show included many modern controversies and problems facing <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">American</a> public high schools today, such as <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenage_pregnancy.html" title="Teenage pregnancy">teenage pregnancy</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_violence.html" title="School violence">school violence</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a>, <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, gang activity, <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay-bashing.html" title="Gay-bashing">gay-bashing</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prayer.html" title="School prayer">school prayer</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, state funding for public education, and general teenage <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angst.html" title="Angst">angst</a>/alienation.</p>
<p><i>Boston Public</i> typically highlighted the tendency of public schools to serve as the flashpoints for the many of the politically volatile controversies in larger scope of American society. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_commentary.html" title="Social commentary">Social commentary</a> also sometimes took the form of using the high school setting to serve as a microcosm of America, enabling the show to act as a forum for public discussion, while other times making more subtle criticisms and statements of contemporary American culture.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Public_c7a0.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>The most notable criticism in <i>Boston Public</i> was that major characters would vanish from the series without a trace. Other characters such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boston_Public_characters_10d0.html" title="List of Boston Public characters">Harvey Lipschitz</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boston_Public_characters_10d0.html" title="List of Boston Public characters">Scott Guber</a> often experienced sudden and unexplained changes in their <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_arc.html" title="Story arc">story arc</a> or personality. For example, Scott works very hard to gain <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boston_Public_characters_10d0.html" title="List of Boston Public characters">Jeremy Peters</a>' trust while dating his mother; however, once he and Meredith are no longer dating, Scott quickly dismisses Jeremy, as if the only reason he was fighting to gain his trust was because he was dating his mother, which to many, seemed out of character. Later, in Season Four, after three seasons of pursuing women of non-<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> descent, Scott tells Steven that he believes <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jews</a> should marry within the faith. (Interestingly enough, an earlier episode featured Scott's mother suggesting he date <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boston_Public_characters_10d0.html" title="List of Boston Public characters">Marilyn Sudor</a>, an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> woman.)</p>
<p>Other complaints includes that the characters were changed to fit the "issue of the episode" instead of acting organically and that the school, too, often changed with the week's themes or stories: sometimes it was a poor urban school that couldn't make ends meet or couldn't pass state tests, while other times, it had a pool, a cable station, elaborate musical theater productions, and overachieving students. Most fans accepted these changes as <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dramatic_license.html" title="Dramatic license">dramatic license</a>, but others vocally disapproved of many of the show's choices.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservative</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest_group.html" title="Interest group">interest groups</a> were unhappy with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boston_Public_characters_10d0.html" title="List of Boston Public characters">Harry Senate</a>'s indictment against the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rifle_Association_d13c.html" title="National Rifle Association">National Rifle Association</a>, episodes that were critical of conservative attitudes towards <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, and explicit talk about sexual matters. They were also unimpressed with the sexual innuendoes and dialogue that often made its way into the series. According to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Family_Association_9cd2.html" title="American Family Association">American Family Association</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_fundamentalism.html" title="Christian fundamentalism">Christian fundamentalist</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobbying.html" title="Lobbying">lobbying</a> group, major television sponsors such as <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg_Company_e5f6.html" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg's</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merrill_Lynch_9fab.html" title="Merrill Lynch">Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy%27s.html" title="Wendy's">Wendy's</a>, <a href="../../../q/w/e/Qwest.html" title="Qwest">Qwest</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papa_John%27s_Pizza_2510.html" title="Papa John's Pizza">Papa John's Pizza</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_Cards_eace.html" title="Hallmark Cards">Hallmark Cards</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriott_International_2d36.html" title="Marriott International">Marriott</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Home_Depot_d2cf.html" title="The Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears_Holdings_Corporation_4aa2.html#Kmart" title="Sears Holdings Corporation">Kmart</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner-Lambert_b0c6.html" title="Warner-Lambert">Warner-Lambert</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campbell_Soup_Company_9972.html" title="Campbell Soup Company">Campbell's Soup</a> consequently stopped running ads during the series because of such criticism.
