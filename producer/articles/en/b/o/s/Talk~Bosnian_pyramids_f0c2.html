<p>It is an interesting exercise to read through "The World of the Maya" by Sam Osmanagich at <a href="http://www.alternativnahistorija.com/WM.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.alternativnahistorija.com/WM.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternativnahistorija.com/WM.htm</a>. In it, a person finds revealing statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... It is my theory that the Maya should be considered watchmakers of the cosmos whose mission it is to adjust the Earthly frequency and bring it into accordance with the vibrations of our Sun. Once the Earth begins to vibrate in harmony with the Sun, information will be able to travel in both directions without limitation. And then we will be able to understand why all ancient peoples worshipped the Sun and dedicated their rituals to this. The Sun is the source of all life on this planet and the source of all information and knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This temple, fortunately, remained hidden and intact until 1989, so that the Masonic cliques were not able to keep it from the world. It is clear that what we see here are space ships which travel between our Solar system and other parts of the galaxy (the head of the Maya is in the vehicles and, thereby, between the Sun and the center of the galaxy).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements and the rather disjointed and rambling nature of this essay certainly raises questions about Mr. Osmanagic's qualifications as and his understanding of even the basics of archaeology.</p>
<p>There is an interesting discussion going about the Bosnian pyramid in <a href="http://www.hallofmaat.com/read.php?1,397244" class="external text" title="http://www.hallofmaat.com/read.php?1,397244" rel="nofollow">Regarding the Bosnian "pyramid"</a></p>
<p>Given that Osmanagic has no qualifications as an archeologist, and no expertise in any of the archeological actions he's taken to date (identifying, dating, and excavating an archeological site), his writings on <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistory.html" title="Pseudohistory">pseudohistory</a> of ancient civilizations and this "pyramid" are especially telling. In "The World of the Maya" writes of the Mayan's connections with <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemuria_%28continent%29.html" title="Lemuria (continent)">Lemuria</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu_%28lost_continent%29.html" title="Mu (lost continent)">Mu</a>, "cosmic harmony", and intragalactic travel in ancient times. It's no surprise then that he, without any evidence at all, dates his "pyramid" to the supposed time of Atlantis. -- (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>I removed this line from the article:</p>

<p>Because the meter, of course, was invented at the end of the 18th century, and therefore is irrelevent to the distance between the three pyramids. Aside from the fact that the precise boundaries of each are not knowable down to the meter, since they are right now just giant hills three times larger than the original structures. --<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 17:39, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The recent rewrite of the article does not meet wikipedia's standards. Statements like "seems to have located [...] the world's largest ancient man-made pyramid", "Osmanagic is an expert on pyramids", "It is suspected that the ancient Illyrian inhbitants [sic] of the Balkans, once thought to be more primitive, actually built these structures" require citations. Otherwise, the article needs to be restructured to make no such original claims. Besides that, the article includes spelling and grammatical errors, and is laid out in a very non-standard way. I will resist reverting to the earlier version (which was at least encyclopaedic in style), but ask that these issues to be addressed as a priority. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 18:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've reverted the recent highly POV changes to the most recent NPOV version of the article.

<dd>Congratulations to those who have encyclopediaised this article. I've been researching this story and browsing internet forums. The facts are hard to come by and the waters are muddied by conspiracy theorists, Bosnian Nationalists, people who want to scoff at Bosnia and people who believe aliens built the pyramids. There is currently a dig ongoing on the site, we must hope that the facts will become clearer in the next few months. Until then all we can do is try to kepp this article free of nationalistic vandalism (from either side) and from the fantasies of sci-fi nuts.

<p>The link to the petition that was anti-Bosnian Pyramid has been removed due to the fact that it was done by a Serbian nationalist who started his argument with 'Stop Taliban Bosnia!'. Taliban has nothing to due with the Bosnian Pyramid and something like this was only done to instigate more problems.</p>

<p>I'm not sure which groups are currently fighting over the content of this page, but as an anthropology student, I'm very disappointed in the credulous journalists who have failed to look into Mr. Osmanagic's qualifications or even attempt to get a general idea of what most actual scholars have to say on the matter. It's wiki articles like this that make me think that there should be more scholarly oversight on pages dealing with the social sciences. There has been no evidence as yet of Osmanagic ever earning an archaeology degree, though he's identified as an archaeologist in the news media (most likely because he presented himself as such and they were too lazy to verify it).</p>
<p>Also, the dates he presents for the "pyramid" would mean a wholesale reeavaluation of European archaeology. To those who don't see this as a problem, I suggest they find the wikipedia page for Occam's Razor. I really hope that an editor (or the original) will do some more research and fix this page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.25.158.122 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.25.158.122.html" title="User talk:70.25.158.122">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.25.158.122_2a75.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.25.158.122">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>If Osmanagic practices in the field of archeology, then he's an archeologist. One reason information sources like wikipedia will eventually surpass formal, bureaucratic academia entirely is that this kind of Defend the Establishment nonsense does <i>not</i> hold authority here. And, by the way, if he's proven correct, which seems more likely than not, are all the academic bureaucrats...the archeological community, in other words...going to admit that their way of doing things is stagnating and generally effed up? I doubt it. --<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 17:42, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question is not one of authority, but of competence and expertise. Osmanagic has demonstrated a clear lack of both, writing a book about the "pyramid" before having any evidence at all to back up his claims. Perhaps Osmanagic can learn something from slightly more professional archeology as demonstrated here: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/letters/smithson.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.snopes.com/humor/letters/smithson.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/humor/letters/smithson.htm</a>.</dd>

At the time he found it, it was debated whether it had ever existed.

<dd>It's worth note that, to this day, there is zero evidence that Schliemann ever found Troy, or that Troy ever existed at all. What he found was the ruins of walled city, in one of the MANY places he attempted to predict Troy might be. Nowhere in the city was there ever found any inscription bearing and version of the name Illium, or anything else which would actually link the city to the mythological city. Walled cities were common, and were usually destroyed by something in the end, with conquest and earthquakes being common. --<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 18:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps, like Schliemann, he's not above some fraud to bolster his assertions. However Schliemann didn't write his books before his discoveries, let alone use them as primary evidence for his claims.</dd>

<dd>Your claim that, somehow, writing a book before proving his point is bad sounds completely backward and bureaucratic. In fact, what he did was establish MORE legitimate authority, because his predictions were correct. He's not some weaselly academic who waits until he has everything sewn up tight for years before finally publishing a paper and claiming it all to be his own. This guy had the balls to stick his neck out, and share his information, BEFORE proving it the hard way. The difference between him and Schliemann is that Osmanagic seems to have been proven correct, while Schiemann simply used smoke and mirrors to annoint any ol' city he found as "Troy". --<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 18:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Osmanagic has done nothing but make things up, then look for ways to convince others he has proof. He's proven nothing other than how gullible people can be. He could write a book before any excavations because the excavations don't matter. He's a charlatan and a fraud.

<p>Back to the petition - it does seem relevant possibly not as an external link but to show how rapidly politicised this issue got with various factions jumping on it.

<p>It has to be noted that serious researchers have disputed heavily Mr.Osmanagics claims as not only incorrect but also that his so-called excavations have been damaging older neolithic and medieval archeological sites&#160;! Apart from this, it has been noted that Mr.Osmanagic seems to have no scientific references to display, despite his claims of "15-year-old-pyramid-research".As is apparent from his books, all of his so-called researches are simple tourist trips!

<p>This is going to be a controversial one so I think we need to keep an eye on the "facts" as some things in the entry seem to be taking Semir Osmanagić's statements as fact. A couple of things that concern me and possibly need to be more qualified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The 213 metre Visocica hill is symmetrically shaped, with sides reportedly sloping at 45° and aligned to the points of the compass."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contour map <a href="http://static.flickr.com/53/129663369_cf4ab1d625_o.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://static.flickr.com/53/129663369_cf4ab1d625_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (extracted from <a href="http://www.bosnianpyramid.com/index_files/Images.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bosnianpyramid.com/index_files/Images.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) shows this just isn't so. The north face is roughly triangular (not in itself remarkably in geomorphological terms) but it is nearly impossible to make out a rectangular plan or even well defined other sides at all (making statements on actual aignment impossible). You can make the hill look pyramidal if you stage your photographs from the N or NE but that doesn't make that statement true. Perhaps better wording might be "Semir Osmanagić has claimed that the 213 metre Visocica hill is symmetrically shaped, with sides reportedly sloping at 45° and allegedly aligned to the points of the compass."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The dig, involving a team of international archaeologists from Australia, Austria, Bosnia, Scotland and Slovenia [1], began in April 2006."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see named "international archaeologists" in this statement from Semir Osmanagić "Foreigners on our team include experienced archaeologist such as: Richard Royce from Australia, Allyson McDavid from U.S., Chris Mundligler from Canada, Martin Aner from Austria." <a href="http://www.bosnianpyramids.org/index.php?id=6&amp;lang=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bosnianpyramids.org/index.php?id=6&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - few of them show up online (apart from in connection with this) suggesting they aren't well established in the field. Mundligler is probably Chris Mundigler <a href="http://www.greatexpeditions.com/TourDetail.asp?TourID=SPA001" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatexpeditions.com/TourDetail.asp?TourID=SPA001" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> but a handful of (unconfirmed) archaeology graduates from different countries hardly counts as "an international team" - I could find archaeologists from America and France to come and look at things in my back garden if I tried hard enough (or made big enough claims) - would that allow me to claim they were an "international team"? My concern is that this seems to be providing false authority to the claims. Perhaps better wording might be: "Archaeologists from around the world, including Australia, Austria, Bosnia, Scotland, Slovenia and the USA, " and then throw in the link I gave <a href="http://www.bosnianpyramids.org/index.php?id=6&amp;lang=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bosnianpyramids.org/index.php?id=6&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> as a source too.</p>
<p>The current last link is Bosnian language only - for English language concerns you can see the Science and Politics blog <a href="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/12/pyramid-in-bosnia_07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/12/pyramid-in-bosnia_07.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> which has a number of entries and links to other places raising concerns.

<p>Caveats: I have expressed a range of concerns about this hill actually being a pyramid (despite my really wanting it to be - ironically as I was eidtting this in someone added other comments with links to what I've said - I'd still recommend using the Science and Politics blog entry as the central one for English language blogging concern about goingson as they link out to various other aspects) so I don't feel I should make those updates and will leave it to more neutral editors to decide on the best way forward (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 17:15, 26 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I agree with you and have changed the statement about the hills symmetry, slope and alignment to a less assertive form. With regards the pedigree of the archaeological team perhaps some wording could be found to communicate that they mostly haven't got any other major digs on their cv's.</dd>

<dd>That is the tricky business - we can't say they are "unrecognised" however we largely have vague handwaving claims made from Osmanagić or sources close to him and this is unconfirmed. I am largely quibbling with the wording as "team" suggests something more organised than it is - which is a few people with archaeology degrees going to take a look and even that is relying on Osmanagić as it is not confirmed and there have been statements made by them. So some kind of tweaking and qualifying "claimed" "individual archaeologists", etc.. If anyone can track down the identity of the named people (there are typos galore) let me know as I will be emailing them for their comments.

<dd>I think that picking at the word "team" is a little excessive. Wiktionary defines team as: any group of people involved in the same activity. So the word team doesn't imply any level of organization at all. Also, the word "international" isn't describing anything more glorious than the fact that all the people are from differant nations(In Wiktionary: Of or having to do with more than one nation). Just because it sounds more impressive than saying "we got guys from all over" doesn't mean its false or has to be edited out. I don't know about using the title archeologist though. So I wwould have to say that a french and american coming to your yard to investigate are an international team (assuming they work together in some way)--<a href="../../../o/l/s/User%7EOlsdude_2ba4.html" title="User:Olsdude">Matt D</a> 23:51, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the <i>facts</i> are shaky, but I wonder if we should be including them. For instance Kaz is right that the 365 metre measurement is nonsense. Nonetheless this <b>is</b> what Osmanagić is claiming. If these are not included then are we misrepresenting his work? Perhaps claims like the 45 degree symmetrical slopes slopes should be included and the caption on the photo changed to
<blockquote>
<p>Visocica overlooking <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visoko.html" title="Visoko">Visoko</a>. Semir Osmanagić states the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetry.html" title="Symmetry">symmetrical</a> nature of the hill and its forty-five degree slopes are indicative of a pyramid. Other archaeologists find the claim controversial.</p>
</blockquote>
Presenting Osmanagić's statements is probably the best way to demonstrate the questionable nature of the claims, but leaves it for the reader to decide. The trick is to write it up without sounding sarcastic. For instance - The fact the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun would be the biggest pyramid shows that the pyramids were all built by the same people and the Bosnian Pyramid was the last <a href="http://www.bosnianpyramid.com/Archive_files/Stories.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bosnianpyramid.com/Archive_files/Stories.html" rel="nofollow">according to Osmanagić</a>. This has been disputed by Osmanagić who has noted that <a href="http://www.fena.ba/uk/vijest.html?fena_id=FSA381913&amp;rubrika=ES" class="external text" title="http://www.fena.ba/uk/vijest.html?fena_id=FSA381913&amp;rubrika=ES" rel="nofollow">it may well have been built first</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 12:11, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we can use the current illustration — which was the best I could find of the half-dozen relevant ones available in wikicommons — to disprove the claims; it's simply not clear enough.

<dd>From what I can make of it, a translation of Osmanagić's book will show he's using the same theories from his other books to support his "pyramid" assertions: namely that aliens from the Pleiades cluster founded Atlantis, whose space-faring ancestors then went on to create all the ancient civilizations in the world. -- (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 14:00, 29 April 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I am the Royce Richards made famous (and notorious) by Mr Osmanagich. I made an initial enquiry into the project and then decided to distance myself from it as it looked to me like someone selling snake oil. I have since had my name published in articles in national newspapers in Australia and in international media as an “Australian Archaeologist out to unearth ancient Bosnian pyramids and rewrite the established version of history........”<br />
Its all a big load of bollocks. The “Bosnian Pyramid” is just a shonky attempt by a shonky person to make a name for themselves, its not something I want to be involved with. Its quite annoying as I now get random emails from all kinds of kooks expecting me to be an authority on Bosnian pyramids!! The damage this will do to my professional reputation is yet to be seen..........!<br />
I never gave Mr Osmanagich permission to give my name to any media organisation and I never gave any media organisation permission to put my name in print. For the record I am an archaeologist. For the record I am not involved in the Bosnian pyramid project. For the record I’m pretty annoyed with finding my name given to the media in relation to Bosnian pyramids.</p>

<p>I thought it <i>could</i> be an imposter, but I've emailed the address in the South Australian government and it's genuine. Royce Richards is, according to the official site, on the archaeological committee. Is this verification enough to be able to write up a section on the misrepresentation of archaeologists? At the moment you only have my word for it that I've emailed him, but realistically the whole world cannot email him to check. It is also provocative enough to inspire a few flames. I thought I'd put it up for debate before writing it up to see what other people think. <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 08:08, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ditto Grace Fegan, the (real) Irish archaeologist. At <a href="http://allaboutbosnianpyram.blogger.ba/" class="external text" title="http://allaboutbosnianpyram.blogger.ba/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> Grace Fegan says:</p>
<p>Date: Mon, 8 May 2006 20:17:46 +0100 (BST) Subject: Re: Questions regarding Bosnian pyramid Dear (*izbrisano*) Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify, once more, my position with regard to this project. I have been a professional archaeologist since 1998 and am currently working for a private consultancy in Ireland. In the course of considering summer volunteer positions on various European excavations I contacted, among others, Mr Osmanagich. I found his contact details on the Archaeological Institute of America website. Mr Osmanagich later replied that he may be in a position to offer me a paid staff position, requiring my presence on site for up to six months. I informed him that I would need to consider this very carefully as I am in full-time employment and would find it difficult to take such extended leave. Mr Osmanagich said he would contact me with a definitive offer and also forwarded some information regarding the site.</p>
<p>The information came in the form of two reports, one was a 'geophysical survey report' (it was unlike any geophysical report I had ever seen) and the other was a 'geological report' (ditto). Having looked through this information it became clear that this project was dubious at best. I did some searching on the web and realised that Mr Osmanagich had no affiliations to any academic body, and was not a qualified archaeologist.</p>
<p>My mistake at this point was not emailing him immediately to inform him that I would not be taking part.</p>
<p>Before I knew it an article had appeared in an Irish newspaper, stating that I was going to be taking part in this Bosnian pyramid project. The article stated that I had excavated Newgrange and described me as an 'eminent Irish archaeologist'. Just to clear things up – Newgrange had been excavated to a satisfactory degree before I had even graduated from my B.A., and although I'm doing well in my career at the moment, I would certainly not describe myself as eminent (at best, I would like to think that my eminence is imminent, he he). I also received phone calls from two British journalists enquiring as to the nature of my involvement in the project. These gentlemen were kind enough to inform me that I was listed on the project website as being one of the 'foreign experts' taking part. When I logged on to the website I found that I was listed as Senior Archaeologist, Kilkenny (I am the senior archaeologist for the firm in which I work, but not for the entire county of Kilkenny!). Most worrying of all was a link through which people could supposedly contact me. When I clicked on it an email address came up of which I had no previous knowledge and to which I had no access. Needless to say, I found this pretty unsettling. Mr Osmanagich used my name in connection with his project when he had no right to do so. He also seems to have made every attempt to make me into something that I am not. In addition he potentially misled those who visited the website that they could contact me, and that whatever responses they would receive would be from me. With regard to the excavations taking place on the 'Bosnian Pyramid' site, I would be very surprised if at the end of the season Mr Osmanagich throws up his hands having failed to find definitive evidence supporting his argument. No matter what is there he will find what he is looking for. That is what happens when a site is not excavated by archaeologists, but glory hunters. Kindest Regards Grace Fegan</p>

Sure, the Runnels critique is another good laugh at the pyramidiots, but there's already plenty of that in the criticism section. There is, however, a valuable clue in there as to how Osmanagic might have attracted his "international team" (ie. inclusion in the Archaeological Institute of America's online listing of excavation opportunities); if only we were able to verify that's what happened. Also, there are apparently <i>five</i> pyramids now!

<p>It's notable that the criticism section is now the dominant feature of the article. While some of us may feel that's appropriate, I suspect a lot of our readers will have come here looking for the juicy details of Osmangic's claims. I'd like to see the Interpretation section beefed up and <i>referenced</i>, lest it appear we're simply straw-manning the whole thing. Also, the redlinking from the Criticism section is actually a little embarrassing; are these really such obscure sources, or is archaeology just one of wikipedia's weak suits? —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 19:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Osmanagić's claims are nonsense, but is it Wikipedia's job to investigate that? I'd hope that a journalist would spot that something is a bit odd, but then I'm an optimist. I've added more about his claims for the pyramid, but I think it needs re-working as if they're not weasel words then close. Like stoat words in a weasel suit. One the other hand the problem is that so many of the "facts" are demonstably false. As I've said above I think the metre claim should go in, but it's hard to do that without making him look like a fool, and I wouldn't be happy poking fun at him for the sake of my own amusement on Wikipedia. That's what I use my blog for&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 10:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If someone as able to get a copy of Osmangic's book that can read Bosnian, they would be able to provide much more information on what Osmangic has actually claimed and why. It would be interesting to find out why the book refers to <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu_%28lost_continent%29.html" title="Mu (lost continent)">Mu</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemuria_%28continent%29.html" title="Lemuria (continent)">Lemuria</a>, plus dates of 40,000 and 27,000 years ago. -- (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 02:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>What is it we're trying to balance? I've seen concern for the expectations of people reading the article who may know little or nothing about the topic, concern that Osmangic is not treated too "skeptically", and concern that the article isn't too critical. -- (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 01:27, 1 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>We're trying <i>not</i> to be the people making the judgments on this, because it's not our job to do that (it would be "original research"). We need to cover the topic fairly from all perspectives, at least while definitive proof either way is not available (the overwhelming balance of probability is insufficient), and hope that people are able to use the information we provide to make up their own minds on the issue. And Ronz, the whole book is online for anyone to read (via the link in External links or in the Osmanagic article. Surely we have some native speakers here? —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 05:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is where I see a difficulty. To people who are following the news reports (which are uncritical) if there isn't at least a description of the claims then it will look like Wikipedia is biased against Osmanagić - which will reduce the credibility of the criticism. The average reader isn't stupid and presented with the all of the facts impartially will almost certainly decide <i>for themselves</i> that this is hype - which is more convincing than an entry which <i>tells</i> them it's nonsense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that the excavation method seems to be scraping the site down to the bedrock with a bulldozer. You will never have definitive proof, only an overwhelming balance of probability. If an overwhelming balance of probability isn't sufficient then a lot of Wikipedia needs to be re-written. I've met people who would dispute the <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figure_of_the_Earth_825d.html" title="Figure of the Earth">Figure of the Earth</a> entry. The pyramid claims are at odds with the ethos of Wikipedia as the claims are unverified. I'd like to put in the demonstrably false claims about three of the pyramids making an equilateral triangle, but I can't see how you can do this without it looking like you're editorialising, or else presenting the claims as if they're true. Neither would help give an accurate impression of the claim.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the best method to allow people to decide that this is gibberish is to present Osmanagić's claims impartially and <i>fully</i>. For instance I'll have a go at writing up a description of the pyramid complex. It's interesting because they've said where the Pyramids of Sun and Moon are, but if you try and pin down the Pyramid of the Dragon then you find it moves depending on which official map you look at. The extensive plans, mainly to do with tourism and infrastructure development at the foundation site might also be worth mentioning. I think if you want to show this is pseudo-archaeology then Osmanagić is your best ally.</dd>

<p>Sean Pilav is a recent graduate - his job is mapping the tunnels. The 'experienced geologist' did an undergraduate degree in engineering geology in 1971 and has worked in mining since.

<p>Royce Richards tells me he finished his undergraduate degree in archaeology in 2004. He's had very little archaeological experience. But he is still on the Foundation's web page as a member of the Archaeology Subcommittee and labelled a 'Senior Archaeologist'. You can imagine how embarrassing that is. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougWeller_622f.html" title="User:DougWeller">DougWeller</a></p>
<p>It looks like the "team" has dwindled to almost nothing. Currently, the official site lists only:</p>
<pre>
 Silvana Čobanov, Degree in Archaeology, University of Zadar
 Saša Janković, archaeologist, University of Belgrade;  
 Anne Handberry, Senior archaeologist, USA;  
 (no name) Department for Aboriginal Affairs, South Australia

<blockquote>
<p>Osmanagic believes the site was chosen in the belief that it was a focal point of energies, like Giza in Egypt. That, he says, could explain the local claim that no one was killed in the three-pyramid area during the 1992-95 war. "The pyramid saved them," he said.</p>

<li>Why are you people so concerned about this story. It is as if you are afraid that people will (just for a moment) stop being cynical and bitter. So what if the man is looking for the pyramid and if people in Bosnia believe in it? It only proves that there are people who are un-cynical on this planet (even after they experienced a genocide!). You will never understand these people. They believe in the pyramid because they want to, because it's a part of their spirit. In the end, if there was a pyramid in Visoko, we will know, soon enough. That there can be a positive human spirit like this in the circumstances like the ones in Bosnia, is a more important discovery than any pyramid in the world.</li>

<dd>Why so concerned? Because the citizens of the town of Visoko, the country of Bosnia, and the world deserve better than to be taken by such charlatans.

<p>The more Osmangic says, the less sense he makes, the more evident he's just making things up. The "Osmanagić's interpretation" section shows this. Should we try to make the section make sense, or continue with it as is, the ramblings of a charlatan?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the claims are contradictory, but I'm not sure he's a <i>charlatan</i>. I'm more inclined to believe that he doesn't know what he's talking about and has a short memory. For instance the article currently states that the Pyramid is between 12,000 and 500 BC. I'm pretty certain I read a claim on the official site (twice) that it could be from before the end of the Ice Age - which would be a very odd misquote. I think if he were intentionally misleading people he'd be much better at it. I don't think you can make the section make sense without editing Osmanagić and people reading the reference might want to know if he has made a specific claim. Then let them make up their own minds. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 20:07, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Economist has an Aug 10th 2006 article that documents some of his more absurd ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr Osmanagic's theories sound fantastical. He believes that the biggest pyramid is one-third taller than Egypt's Great Pyramid, and that they were built by an ancient civilisation 12,500 years ago. “Yes,” says Mr Osmanagic, who has been denounced by Bosnian archaeologists as a hallucinating lunatic, “we are rewriting the history of the world.” Indeed. Mr Osmanagic, who has also written about survivors from the mythical island of Atlantis who built pyramids in Central America—and about Hitler escaping in the direction of the Antarctic in 1945—says his enemies are just jealous.</p>

<dd>The official sites appear to be removing references to the size of the "pyramids". The 220m claim seems to be just a reference to the size of the hill from it's generally accepted base. The hill is 767m above sea level at it's peak. The hill begins it's steep incline generally between 500m and 550m above sea level, depending on the approach. The claimed height is completely arbitrary, other than the Foundation's need to justify the locations of their digs. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:37, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the interest of averting an edit war with <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">User:Jeremygbyrne</a>, can various editors interested in this topic offer suggestions on a proper characterization of S.

Obviously this brings us into NPOV/POV territory, but I think their are NPOV ways to say that someone is pretending to be something he is not. Taking an extreme NPOV view of him does no service to an uninformed reader who might use this article to form an honest opinion of the man. <a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHiberniantears_02e6.html" title="User:Hiberniantears">Hiberniantears</a> 17:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

How do we indicate the people involved, most notably Osmanagić, are charlatans while retaining a NPOV? When did reality become a point of view that had to be balanced with the claims of conmen, charlatans, or the deluded?

<dd>It is a problem so I've been reading the guidelines, particularly the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> section.
<blockquote>
<p>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources, <b>regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false</b>. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth.</p>

<dd>The claims that he is an archaeologist are in what would otherwise be called credible sources: The BBC, AP and Reuters. It's lousy and lazy, but those are the reports. I think the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Hancock_c42c.html" title="Graham Hancock">Graham Hancock</a> entry might be a useful guide. In this sense I'd say that Osmanagić statements can and should be reported - even when they flatly contradict each other - along with the views of Bosnian archaeologists and foreign archaeologists and leave it to the reader's intelligence to decide if Osmanagić's claims are reliable. If a reader genuinely thinks that the Bosnian Pyramids were built by a civilisation with the aid of aliens from the Pleiades, then a line stating he's a pseudo-archaeologist probably isn't going to be persuasive. Further the entry might be used by people not to see <i>if</i> the pyramid exists, but by people who know this is nonsense but want to see what Osmanagić <i>is saying</i> about the pyramid.</dd>

<p>This page needs to be brought into line with the truth about the "pyramids".</p>
<p>At present articles like this make a mockery of wikipedia.</p>
<p>Hi I don't know how to sign my comments really but yes I am not responsible for what's written here above, I do however see that persons point, the article at the moment does give one the impression that there could possibly be a pyramid there. There is however obviously no pyramid to be found there, when I first heard the news of a pyramid in Bosnia I thought that it was sorta exciting but it's just BS, a mistake, a hoax a fuckup who knows. Either way this article should tell it like it is, there are no pyramids there. (Signed by me or something)</p>

<dd>I strongly disagree. I think it creates POV problems, and it is contrary to the previous discussions above on how to present a proper POV for this article. Osmanagic seems, after a year of making them, incapable of making coherent and consistent claims. Further, real scientists have examined the evidence and given their explanations of the evidence. Claiming that it's Sam's claims vs dismissions of those claims ignores the fact there there is actual evidence that requires interpretation, and actual expertise required to make logical and consistent interpretations. There's real science here, no matter what Sam may say or do. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 20:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What POV are you talking about? If a section lists all the positions against Osmanagić's claims, it is POV to call it "Other positions"!</dd>

<dd>And I'm saying that your point of view, the pov you're promoting with your edits, is that this is simply an issue of "there are claims and debunkers." If you don't understand what evidence is there, as detailed in the article and in this discussion page, then we're not going to make much progress resolving this. However, playing devil's advocate a bit, why not instead rewrite the entire article around the scientific evidence, how that evidence indicates there is no large man-made pyramid-like structures, and how Sam ignores all this evidence? Or perhaps we can settle it another way - what can you cite to favor your changes? --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 00:46, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What can I cite for my change? (1) the fact that all of the opinions in "other interpretations" are against "Osmanagić's interpretation", and (2) that all of the supporters of those opinions are <i>by far</i> more authoritative than Osmanagić in their fields. So "Debunking" is much more appropriate that "Other opinions".</dd>
<dd>It is my understanding (but this is a completely different matter than the changes I proposed) that none of the claims of Osmanagić have been confirmed by <i>independent</i> and <i>authoritative</i> sources. For this reason, I would clearly state in the article that this is a hoax. But this is a different story.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanarjedde_04da.html" title="User:Panarjedde">Panarjedde</a> 01:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If one section lists Osmanagić's claims and the other lists all the other positions then "Other positions" seems a plausible heading. Using the term 'debunking' puts the POV that the pyramids are a lot of rubbish, which I absolutely agree with, but it is POV because it's saying the majority scientific opinion is correct. It's annoys me greatly but check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Pseudoscience" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Pseudoscience" rel="nofollow">the FAQ on pseudoscience</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>If we're going to represent the sum total of human knowledge, then we must concede that we will be describing views repugnant to us without asserting that they are false. Things are not, however, as bad as that sounds. The task before us is not to describe disputes as though, for example, pseudoscience were on a par with science; rather, the task is to represent the majority (scientific) view as the majority view and the minority (sometimes pseudoscientific) view as the minority view; and, moreover, to explain how scientists have received pseudoscientific theories. This is all in the purview of the task of describing a dispute fairly.</p>
</blockquote>
Using the heading debunking is asserting (correctly) that the claims are false. It's one of those areas that shows Wikipedia isn't perfect, but if we ignore it then there's no defence when a New Age Wikipedian comes along and re-writes the entry to their point of view. The easiest way to show that Osmanagić is a crank is to baldly state the facts and assume the reader isn't a fool. It's more persuasive if the reader is allow to come to their own opinion rather than being told what it is. The sort of reader who is a fool isn't going to be swayed by any facts. --<a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlunsalt_b901.html" title="User:Alunsalt">Alunsalt</a> 14:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Anyone know why I can't see the references? Do others have this problem?) - It's the gallery tag that's causing it.</p>
<p>It's now almost a year since the pyramid pr started. Early on, the sources available were few and poor. I think we have enough available sources now that we should at least discuss this article's reliance on poor sources, and what changes should be made now that many better ones are available. Minimally, I think the article could contain a section critical of most media about the pyramid, citing the multiple sources that have published such media criticisms. Additionally, I think it's worth considering adding something about this being a hoax designed to increase tourist revenue and influence politics across Bosnia, again citing the multiple sources available. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 19:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm proposing that we stop treating Osmanagić and APBPSF (Archaeological Park: Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation) are reliable sources. If needed, we can summarize all the evidence. If the source for material is Osmanagić or APBPSF, we should look for other reliable sources before incorporating it, otherwise it should not be added to the article. For example, there are claims that Aly Abd Barakat thinks portions of the hill are man-made, but we have no reliable sources confirming this and more importantly we have no sources that confirm if Barakat thinks there is a pyramid or just other man-made structures. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree to an extent. It's been demonstrated that Osmanagić is not a reliable source with fabrication of experts who turned out not to be on site.

<dd>I agree. We need to report what Osmanagić claims about the situation.

<li>A number of the external links are to blog (or blog-like) websites written by recognized authorities.</li>
<li>A number of the blog/blog-like websites written by English speakers from Bosnia. Because the vast majority of information about the Foundation and their work is in Bosnian, these websites provide very useful insite into what otherwise would be unavailable to readers.</li>
<li>A number of these blog/blog-like websites have been used as references in the sources currently in the article.</li>

<p>Hi Gene, I saw that you reverted my edits on a couple of pyramid related pages to include links to the pages on Ukrainian and Bosnian pyramids (and for links to the pyramid category as well). I just wanted to clarify why these links do not belong. The Bosnian "pyramid" is considered a hoax. If the digging on the Bosnian hill does eventually reveal a pyramid, then the links are justified. However, until proof of a pyramid is found, the site remains a hill, with an archeologically significant medieval village on top. In the case of the Ukrainian pyramid, the press simply carried a wrong impression of the site into the popular culture. This innacuracy was soon clarified by the archaeologist in charge. <a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHiberniantears_02e6.html" title="User:Hiberniantears">Hiberniantears</a> 12:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please do not revert the external links sections of pyramid articles again. I am well aware that the Bosnian and Ukrainian "pramids" are not really pyramids, and that the scientific consensus supports this - however that is entirely beside the point; the main reason they are known by most people is because some people claimed they were pyramids; it is not for us to make value judgements concerning those claims; our job is simply to provide links to all pyramid-elated articles and let people read those articles and decide for themselves. The "see also" list is a list of related subjects - it is not merely a list of "legitimate pyramids". --Gene_poole 01:39, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think when something is either falsely called, or accidentally called, something it is not, no reasonable source of information would list it said entity under the misleading heading. For example, when a toddler calls a car a boat, the rest of the world does not have to amuse the toddler by now considering cars as boats "because some people claimed they were" boats. I realize you're taking an inclusionist stance on this, and I respect that. However, I think the fact that the articles themselves are already improperly named is inclusionist enough. Including the Ukrainian and Bosnian "pyramids" in a list of legitimate pyramids is very efficient way to undermine any intellectual weight this encyclopedia has. I think making lists of things which are entirely opposed to the scientific consensus (and in the case of the dig site in Ukraine, against the stated clarification by the archaeologist leading the dig) is irresponsible. To that end, I am once again making my reverts, but in the interest of fairness, I am also moving this conversation to the talk pages of the articles. <a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHiberniantears_02e6.html" title="User:Hiberniantears">Hiberniantears</a> 12:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "see also" section is meant to be a list of articles <i>broadly related</i> to the article subject. It is <i>not</i> intended merely as a list of "directly related subjects" - or in this case, a list of "authentic pyramids". Deliberately expunging links to articles on clearly related subjects as you are attempting to do constitutes an inappropriate application of a personal <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> to the editing process; it is not our place to be making value judgements of this nature. I am consequently restoring the article to the default position prior to your edits. If you feel this is inappropriate, you may wish to establish a straw poll on the subject to help establish community consensus on the subject before attempting to implement further changes. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 22:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
