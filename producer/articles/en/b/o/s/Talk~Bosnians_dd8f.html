<p>Let's say an african is living in Norway and calls himself norwegian, which is completly ok since he's a citizen of the country. But can he call himself norwegian in the same way a norwegian calls himself or herself. No he can't he is not an ethnic norwegian by other words he is not norwegian in his genes or heritage, he is not what some people would call a real norwegian.</p>
<p>Do you get my point Dado, it's the same thing with bosnians. A Croat or a Serb can't be bosnian in the same way a bosniak is, since the bosniaks are ETHNIC BOSNIANS, BOSNIANS IN THEIR HERITAGE AND GENES. Can you call a serb or a croat an etnical bosnian, NO YOU CANT SINCE THEY ALLREADY ARE ethnic croats and serbs, and you can't be both an ethnic bosnian and an ethnic serb or croat at the same time, that's impossible, you have only ONE ethnicity, the bosniak ethnicity is bosnian...the croat ethnicity is croatian and the serb ethnicity is serbian. You could consider serbs and croats as immigrants to Bosnia at the same way africans in Norway are immigrants. WHAT IS THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND&#160;!!!</p>
<p>Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia were all states of Yugoslavia. It's like saying "You were born in New Jersey,but you live in New York." You would consider them New Yorkers or Americans. Before the Yugoslav Civil War everybody was known as Yugoslavians. Only Slovenians and Macedonians had a real ethnic difference. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_H._f524.html" title="User:Damir H.">Damir H.</a></p>
<p>Classifications that you are talking about are not as rigid as you may think. The point of the article is not to portray Bosnians as ethnicity that you may define to be a group of people that share common genetic make-up (although it is not necessary to have genetic similarity to be part of an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic.html" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a> group). The article considers Bosnians as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a> which is much more loosely assembled group of people with common traits and interests (not necessarily genetic). Still more genetic similarity between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks is much larger than genetic similarity between Africans and Norvegians so your comparison is rather poor. Bottom line the point of the article is to define an identity of people that generally emphasize their Bosnian identity as a choice over their ethnicity. Specifically, a Bosnian Serb or a Bosnian Croat can be as much Bosnian as Bosniak if they choose both inherently as people stemming from teritory of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as anthropologically as people belonging to the same or similar cultural group. I would also ask you to sign your comments as I feel strange talking to an IP address. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 23:41, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
But Dado what you are trying to say is that serbs and croats are as much bosnians as bosniaks(BOSNIANS&#160;!!), unbelievable way of reasoning... as you maybe recall neither serbs or croats want to call themselves bosnians, they prefer calling themselves serbs and croats (because that is what they are) and furthermore you know very well that the serbs and the croats wanted Bosnia and bosnianhood to disappear some ten years ago, they wanted to split up Bosnia between them and connect to croatia and serbia, they don't want at all the expression BOSNIAN to exist they don't want BOSNIA to exist, please try to understand. When saying "I am bosnian" NOBODY thinks of serbs or croats, the first thing that crosses their mindes is BOSNIAK</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, yes, they do&#160;:) These daily-political classifications as *only* Serbs or only Croats are a matter of opinion, but for example in Croatia it is no less common to say that someone is a "Bosanac" if they are Croat, Bosniak or Serb. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 19:49, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Putting the article on a side and on a personal note I recognize the current opinions and politics on the ground, but why do you want to help those individuals who don't want or accept to be Bosnian or who are distroying the bosnianhood as it was defined for hundreds of years. Their denial and your acceptance of their denial all looks to me as a feuded stubborn family affair that is part of a vicious cicle. Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats will never want to be considered Bosnians as long as there is someone to tell them they have no right to be one which is what you are claiming. I realize they would probably not change their mind anyway but the historical definition of Bosnianhood includes those people no matter if they currently like it or if you currently deny it. The option still exists today if they choose to use it and it is how nations as ideas survive.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 01:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, a black man can still be or become Norwegian, as all Norwegians were not of the same descent, the thing that glued them together was culture, not genes. Ethnicity is not genetic, but cultural, we did all stem from one race. I do know that people dont have this view in their head, but thats because their head was thought this way. Thus, a claim that they cant be is racist, not scientific, let alone objective or neutral.</p>

<p>The information here should be deleted because it is false. Person who was posting definitions and explanations of who Bosnians are has no knowledge, education, experience, and credentials to define who is Bosnian. It is very sad and unfortunate when someone who has no clear idea what "Bosnian" is, after so many Bosnians who died for their Bosnian Nation therefore definition as well, ignores it and post on the Wikipedia that Bosnians are Serbs or "Bosnian Serbs". Bosnians are "Bosnian people of all religions" who admit Bosnia as their homeland country. To claim that Bosnians are Serbs is as if you claim that Serbs are Croats, and Chinese are African.</p>
<p>Bosnian of orthodox, catholic, islamic, hindu, urdu, buddistic or any religion whatsoever is Bosnian if he choses Bosnia as his homeland country or simply "country" and his religion is at this point irrelevant. He is still Bosnian. Serbs clearly do not admit Bosnia as their country, therefore they can't be defined as "Bosnians". In the same way, you can't claim that Serb is Bosnian because he already said he is "Serbian". Neither you can define Serb as "Bosnian Serb" therefore as "Bosnian" because he still admits Serbia as "his country", and not Bosnia.</p>
<p>Why are you defining people who don't want to be Bosnians - "Bosnians" and not allowing others who do feel they are Bosnians to say so? Even if you think that he is "Bosnian" because he lives in Bosnia, it is his will to claim what country is "his country", and if he claims he is "Serb", you can't change that. At least you know he is not Bosnian. At the same time if a person is claiming he is "Bosnian" no matter what is his religion, even if heis orthodox or catholic, he is Bosnian because he admits Bosnia as "his country", so don't call this person Serb, Croat or whatever, he is Bosnian. It is his choice.</p>
<p>Bosnians died for Bosnian language, for Bosnian Independence, for Bosnian freedom, for Bosnian Identity, for any Bosnian who belongs to Bosnian Nation no matter what religion that Bosnian were. Bosnians of all religions were dying to defend Bosnia from Serbs, Croats and everyone else. How ignorant someone can be to dismiss any criticism they receive here, and not to attempt to change the definition knowing that it's insulting to Bosnians to be defined falsly. Please correct definition otherwise it serves no puprose to anyone, and it's insulting to all Bosnians.</p>

Instead of giving us a lecture and resorting to personal attacks while you have no clue about who wrote the article why don't you propose a specific changes that you want to take place in the article.

<p>Hi Dado, he does still have a point, althought the emphasis is not majorally on country but culture. U cant say that Serbs or Croats dont want to admit they are Bosnians, if they feel it as their culture they are, if not they arent. U c culture only exists in the present, the past doesnt count, coz today isnt the same as yesterday, the fact that some of their ancestors, yes some or even the major part, were Bosnians doesnt matter, as it doesnt matter that the ancestors of Bosnians were Slavs, Ilirs, Red Croats, Romans,etc. Today their culture is different, so if their culture is serbian it is serbian, if croatian it is croatian, if bosnian bosnian, if bosniak bosniak. If u would like to take the past in account, then there are no cultures but one, the human one, deriving from Adam (scientificly or teologically speaking there was an Adam). So we all are one. And religion had a big role in defining what is Bosniak for instance, a smaller one, but still large for Croats and Serbs, especially in Bosnia, coz they felt, they had a different culture because of that. Oh yes there was also a lot of intentional migration of Serbs by the Ottomans, besides the migration peoples chose for themselves.</p>

<p>This article has been given a clean up tag due to its containing multiple badly structured sentences, being downright confusing, and stylistic issues such as large blocks of text that could probably be broken up into smaller usable paragraphs. It probably also deserves a disputed neutrality tag as well, but I don't feel like I'm capable of judging that.

I agree that there are some language problems due to various partial edits which were done over time. There may also be some issues regarding the accuracy but hardly enough to justify a neutrality tag. A good editing could do the job. I would appriciate the help as I had read the article too many times to realize the conceptual mistakes easily. I need a fresh eyes to look at it.

<p>First, a personal disclaimer: I am from Bosnia and I don't mind being called <i>bosanac</i>. But the contents of this article is more your wishful thinking and POV than it resembles anything close to (sad or good, depending on one's POV) reality. The truth is that over {n%, n&gt;95} of Bosnian population declare themselves as one of {Bosniak, Serb, Croat}, and over 50% of these are either offended or at least uneasy when being referred to as a "Bosnian", especially in ethnic sense. Thus, you will hardly sell your ideas on a "pan-Bosnian" nation. I accept that there is a (small but not <b>so</b> insignificant) amount of people that do declare themselves as Bosnians in ethnic/national sense (similar as <b>Jugosloveni</b> in SFRY), but this article does not talk about them, at least not exclusively. Further, figures are misguiding, as they refer to all people living or originating from Bosnia, but the text is clear as mud in whether it refers to residents of Bosnia or imaginary "Bosnian nation" (with tendency towards the latter). As a parallel, "Belgians" (residents of Belgia) do not have their own page. I don't see why Bosnians would have one, and <b>especially</b> not like current one. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 15:11, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you first have to distinguish the difference between <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>. It is more complex than what you are making out of it especially when one considers modern definition of a nation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article is not talking about Bosnian nation in an ethnic sense which is how you may be understanding it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One can belong to different ethnicity and still be part of a Bosnian nation. This article does not claim that Bosnians are an ethnic group but they are a nation because they portray certain distinguibale traits. Their particular traits are based in culture, customs, territory, common history and choice, and not necessarily common genetic make-up, religion and herritage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You said it yourself that you don’t mind being called a Bosanac. That is a whole point of the article. You are not the only one who accepts being called Bosanac and I am sure that you have expressed it several times as well which falls in at least one of the distiguishable traits of how others would recognize your identity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are also correct that 95% of population of Bosnia and Herzegovina declare themselves as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat as prescribed choice but that does not prevent them from being part of a common nation. You have no way of proving that such a great number of people would object to being called Bosanac under terms noted above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each nation is distinguished by different traits so comparing it to other nations does not suite the purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there are particular corrections that you want to see on the article please note them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Otherwise POV tag is not justified.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 17:18, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am aware of distinction of nation vs. ethnicity. I do get your point. However, unfortunately, we can hardly talk about "Bosnian nation" for a people who nowadays certainly does <b>not</b> have a common national feeling. Let us compare the situation with e.g. France. France is a secular state whose constitution (and/or tradition) defines "French nation" as collectivity of all French citizens regardless of ethnicity, and that definition is in turn backed up by support of citizens involved -- French blacks, French Arabs, French Basques etc. describe themselves "French".</dd>
<dd>However, no matter how you wish it to be, the situation in Bosnia is not like that. "Bosnian nation" is not backed up by constitution, and the concept is opposed by at least 2/3 of its citizens. Bosnia is an ethnicity-based and deeply divided state. I sympathize your POV, but it has little grounds in reality.</dd>
<dd>If you wish, here's a list of statements I dispute; however, I think the entire article is misguided -- you just copied most of the information from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> page, added your own POV and changed "Bosniaks" to "Bosnians". As it is now, I don't see why Bosnians deserve its own separate page if the primary meaning of the word is quite non-telling "citizen of/person born in Bosnia". I think it's a weasel technique.
<ul>
<li><i>Many people from Bosnia and Herzegovina prefer to call themselves "Bosnians",</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Um, <i>many</i>? This is a non-word. Only ethnic Bosniaks prefer so.
<dl>
<dd>True, most Bosniaks prefer it. Most mixed marrige families prefer it, Most non-nationalists prefer it. Even some ethnic Serbs and Croats prefer it. At least 2/3 of the population prefers it.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is fairly OK in <b>regional</b> sense (although some ultranationalists would object). I mean, it is generally OK to call a man from Bosnia <i>bosanac</i>. But we don't have pages for Serbians, Croatians, Vojvodinians, Krajišnici, Sarajlije etc. just to denote people who originate from/live in given piece of territory -- the pages on that particular territory cover that already.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>During the time when Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia Bosnians were not recognized as a nation. Bosnians were listed under the category "regional affiliation" by the Yugoslavian statistics.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Bosnians could not be recognized as nation because Bosnia was not a state, and those who had no ethnical preferences usually declared as "Yugoslavs". The whole sentence is thus meaningless.
<dl>
<dd>Serbia and Croatia were not states either but their populations were recognized as nations.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not their populations. Their <b>ethnicities</b>. E.g. Hungarians from Vojvodina were never ever referred to as "Serbs"; "Serbians" (srbijanci) at best (see above for regional affiliation). Since last war, Bosniaks also received that "right" (in the compromise form of the name) but Bosnians did not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Number of Bosnians: these are meaningless figures - 2 to 4 mil. in Bosnia??? Why can't you tell how many of these are, i.e. do you count out those who don't like to be called Bosnian?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2 million is a minimum. Up to 4 million is probably a streach. (3 million is more realistic) What do you think it should be?--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whatever. These are figures about people originating/living in BiH, and as I said above it's irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>In 1992 a referendum was held for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina which was to be founded on a principle of a single Bosnian nation</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is clearly your interpretation. Croats who voted for independence most certainly did not have that idea.
<dl>
<dd>This is no-ones interpretation. I am not aware of the Croat interpretation that you are implying and even than it cannot be generalized. The concept and the purpose of the referendum was clear. It was based on citizen based Bosnia consisting of three ethnic groups. Perhaps that can be added or clarified--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This interp is not what is wirtten in the article -- it's miles away.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>While in 1993 the name Bosniaks was re-introduced to replace the term Muslim it was too late for that term to be realistically accepted by non-Muslim Bosnians, as they were already naturalized into Serb and Croat nations during the 50 year long subjugation by Yugoslavia and further radicalized by the ethnic animosities among all three ethnic groups.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Here, you reiterate your POV that Bosnian nation kind of existed, but Bosnian Orthodoxes and Catholics were somehow "naturalized" into Serbs and Croats by means of pressure from their respective "home nations". However you put it, that process has not lasted for last 50 years, but for at least 200, as you contradict yourself saying that "Serbs, Croats and even some Muslims opposed Kalay's idea" in <b>19th century</b>.
<dl>
<dd>You are right that the section is a bit unclear about the entire process and should refer to larger segment of history, both the initial rejections and further Yugoslavian rejection, which are by the way not mutually exclusive. It is true also that Serbian and Croatian search for national identity did not start until mid 19th century. Bosnian identity started later due to various historical reasons. One does not have to be forced into a particular nation (Serb or Croat). It is enough to incentize people into joining a particular group while defining particular philosophical reason for such assimilation and denying the other (Bosnian). It is true also that in the process of Croat and Serb national enlightment the question of multicultural and multireligious populous of Bosnia in 19th century was intentionally pushed away. This is still used today to deny the purpose and justification for Bosnian state for purposes of splitting the country up among its polarized population and eventually joining its parts with their primary nation states (Greater Serbia syndrom). The Bosnians did not have to be officially recognized for idea to exist and survive (we are still talking about it more than 100 years after its inception aren’t we). --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't get your point here. With necessary (over)generalization, Bosniaks' (an united/unitary Bosnia similar to situation in SFRY), Serbs' (disbanding Bosnia and joining the Serbia) and Croats' (retaining Bosnia but under a strong influence of Croatia) goals are well known. There are due and notable exceptions to that, but the idea of pan-Bosnian nation now remains primarily the Bosniaks' concept. That concept was more close (but still far) to reality in SFRY days, but today it's dead &amp; burried among 2/3 of Bosnian population.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Finally, if you say that you talk only about Bosnian nation in political sense, what are "Related ethnic groups" doing in the sidebar? What is only "Bosnian language" doing there? How is it related with "2.5 to 4 mil." figure?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Related ethnic groups are groups that comprise Bosnians. I know that Bosnian language will be disputed. The point is that it is a myth that Bosnia has 3 languages. All speak same dialect (ijekavan) , all read and write cirilic and latin script, and all use uniquely Bosnian words in regular conversation, which are not used in other two languages. But this is another discussion. I am sure that when you speak to people from Serbia or Croatia that they can spot the difference immidiatly (I could be wrong but it is a good guess, right)--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 15:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, you used "Ethnic groups" template for that. About the language, I can agree that it is the same in linguistic sense, but the reality is that it's 3 languages in political sense, and unfortunately it's the latter that counts.<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 11:22, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In the end, current situation in Bosnia is not a clear cut. Yes, there are many who deny the Bosnian nationhood but the clear direction to which Bosnia is going, and this can be seen from recent unifications of many institutions and changing political climate, that Bosnain nationhood is a reality.</p>
<dl>
<dd>...in your dreams.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The political climate is cooling down indeed, but note that unification came out largely due to increased pressure of international community and not due to good will of participants. Maybe (but unlikely) this process will continue in the direction you wish but my estimate is that even so, it would take no less than 30-40 years before we can talk about "Bosnian nation". Today, it is wishful thinking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps not as well defined and confirmed as French but similar in its inception. Also refer to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europeanism.html" title="Europeanism">Europeanism</a> movement. It is perhaps the closest parallel to the idea of Bosnian nationhood.</p>

<p>By the way I have used material from several articles and I put it in the larger context. There is nothing wrong with that and it shows that I have done my research.</p>
<p>The article is usefull and justified both in historical and contemporary context. I ask you to make appropriate changes and quit denying its purpose.

Nikola. Duja may have a particular opinion about this (and I respect it), but it just that, an opinion. The article is not deceptive, it is based on historical data and valid arguments.

<dd>Dado, please stop removing the tag. This is a free encyclopedia, and the tag (please read its contents) serves to warn the readers that disputes <b>exist</b>, and they obviously do. It is sufficient to have one user (and here are at least two of us, while <a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">User:Tjstrf</a> also expressed scepticism about it) disagree with the article, and, proven benevolence and serious arguments (both of which, I think, I exhibited), put the tag. Since this is a free encyclopedia, I can't prevent you from removing the tag, but leaving it is the least I expect from you. I did not delete, move or destroy the article (although I still deem it to be highly your POV) but putting the tag is the least that should be done.<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 15:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I have asked several times for you to correct the article in a way that you think it will not be POV. I am sorry if you have a problem to formulate your thoughts in a way that can be applied on the article but it serves no good nor is it justified to so simply brand the article POV without giving a specific reccomendation on how to change it or improve it. Why do you think it is my POV. As you said and I have confirmed I have taken material from several articles and placed in another context that is observable in reality. I will leave the POV tag for now but I am asking for some help here. The article is free and unlocked. What prevents your from changing it.

<p>One major issue of concern for me is the ethnicity template. Although I do believe there is such a thing as a "Bosnian" nation (i.e., Bosniaks Croats, Serbs, and others who recognize their personal ethnic heritage but consider their belonging to a multiethnic Bosnian culture foremost) I don't believe this template fits because it was made for ethnic groups and nations. Bosnians simply don't have their own language (as don't the Belgians or Swiss), and the fact that the languages on the ground are nearly identical is nonwithstanding. Its also rather pointless to include "related" ethnic groups. I feel it would be best to create a new "nation" template of some sort that would include sections for "primary languages", "primary religions", "primary ethnic groups", etc. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 16:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Live, I can agree with you (sort of). But, here we reached the full circle. I don't deny there are such people. Also, there are many famous persons who should indeed be listed as belonging to common Bosnian heritage rather to make them injustice in old-new ethnic division (let's add Goran Bregovic, perhaps Mesa Selimovic, Ivo Andric and Zdravko Colic) (Also, I'm having problems trying to drive off nationalists fixing national entry for e.g. Rambo Amadeus; hopefully Johnny Stulic article is still OK). But this current article has no such concept. I have to reiterate my previous points:</dd>
<dd>1) (AFAIK) No other nation has a page on its nationality. All of that is already covered on (sub) pages of the state name.
<dl>
<dd>Even if that is true there is no reason why there should not be one.

<dd>I surely can't stop you, but I can object (and vandalize if I were in such mood). But why are you trying to make a <b>precedent here</b> on such a controversial issue? Even you can agree that number of persons who declare themselves Bosnians is significantly smaller than the total BiH population. And I see that you cross-linked many pages to this one; obviously, this is a part of an agenda. Great, Bosnians are an ethnic group of Montenegro (but until the next 5 minutes). Most Wiki pages on ex-Yu issues are now in relative peace and consensus (at least the relatively small percent I watch). It is you who are trying to sell the Trojan horse.<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 13:08, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

If you are calling dismbiguation of this subject (that is obviously called out on many pages and hence deserves a clarification) my agenda, than yes it is my agenda. But you could also call it my contribution to this project to the best of my knowledge and , thank god, I can be corrected if need be. I will however leave the your choice of words to you. I will correct the number that is called out to a more realistic estimate. I still don't understand your defensiveness and I hardly can understand what you are implying by "Trojan horse". There are no other issues here that I can respond to.

<dl>
<dd>OK, let's calm down this discussion. I apologize if I accused you too harshly on Bosnian unitarism; I do believe in your good will (unlike Emir's). However, I do see this article as "more contraversial than <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a>" simply because majority of the first two oppose the idea of the common Bosnian nation. Since the term itself is obviously too vague, as a compromise, I suggest a preamble with links to relevant pages (similar to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegians.html" title="Norwegians">Norwegians</a> page), and leave the rest of the article talking about the concept of "Bosnian nation" (<b>unlike</b> Norwegians page).</dd>

<dd>2) There are persons that feel that they belong to common Bosnian nation. ~95% of them are Bosniaks (as this is Bosniak national agenda); the rest either come from mixed marriages or are sickened by nationalism. Bosniaks have their page already, and the others don't form a collectivity that deserves an article (although they should be mentioned somewhere, perhaps in Ethnic Groups of Bosnia).
<dl>
<dd>You are probably right about current statistics (not also historically) on how many people consider themselves Bosnians.

Other than giving the blanket statement about the entire article how about being more specific. Religion is mentioned only few times in the article and I am not sure that it relates to the article in a sense that you may think. Could you clarify your dispute.</p>
<p>"people not liking a definition they are classed under is a valid reason to get rid of the definition." Who are the people that are not linking the definition. So far we had only Nikola Smolenski disputing it and he is clearly not Bosnian nor anyone would even consider him Bosnian (nor a person who can pride himself with objective edits on this and similar matters)</p>
<p>"the existance of the subject in question" The subject being Bosnians you are either implying for the issue to go away or to Bosnians to go extinct (kind of like shut up or die). Bosnians are the fact of life. The issue will not go away.</p>

<dd>I gave up the fight in this page long time ago, as I feel like having more useful things to do. So, (as probably my last comment on this page), I'll just stress the arguments raised by <a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a>:
<ul>
<li>If "Bosnian" merely means "the resident of Bosnia and Herzegovina", then this article is pretty much unnecessary, as this is a self-telling definition, and there is already Bosnia and Herzegovina article (which this article should be redirected to).</li>
<li>If, as suggested with the current version of the article, it means "Bosnian nation", then the issue of existence of such nation (BiH is obviously not a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a>) is disputed, as in my opinon, it implies that the majority has a clean identification with the concept, whereas the majority of Bosnian citizens currently opposes that idea, and attributes it to the agenda of political leadership of Bosniaks.</li>
</ul>

<dd><a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 16:04, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While you perhaps approach this issue from a political perspective I am approaching it from a anthropological one. Perhaps that is not clear in the article. My contributions to this article was to point out to issues of identity of people coming from BiH. Variably they use the term Bosnians as well as the designation of their ethnicity depending on the circumstances. The definition that Bosnians are a nation makes sense because they have many traits of a nation (not just the common country). I did not mean to write an article about the “Bosnian citizanship”.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the point where it really breaks down. As written, the article is not about <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. The only aspect of anthropology that it covers is cultural anthropology, and since there are 3 cultures involved, all of which have their own pages, it's not necessary in that sense. If you preferred to make the article be solely about the word bosnian, you could probably do that without violating npov.

<p>As for the validity of the need for the article I don’t think there should be any argueing. The name is commonly used among many local and international circles (as Bosnian and Bosanci)</p>
<p>The core of the issue to my understanding is:</p>
<p>Given that the term Bosniak was introduced in 1993 to replace the word Muslim many Bosniaks select that term as a method of protecting their ethnic interests and historical background within the constitution of BiH. They select term Bosnians when they want to express their identity and assimily within a larger BiH community that includes other ethnic groups as well (similar as in example Germans and Europeans). Some however try to monopolize term Bosnian as inherently Bosniak which is historically wrong if above definitions are in place.</p>
<p>Croats are generally ambivelent to the issue and generally split between Bosnia group and Herzegovina group former being more inclined towards Bosnian identity and latter towards ethnic Croatian.</p>
<p>This one is paradoxial. Serbs more recently do not want to be considered Bosnians, but they also don’t want Bosniaks to declare themselves Bosnians either, as that, in their minds and not entirely baseless, means that Bosniaks are monopolizing the term Bosnian to which they have some rights as well (which they are not willing to pursue). However, many Bosnian Serbs have historically declared themselves as Bosnians.</p>
<p>I accepted that there are some ambiguity about how many Bosnians are there but this is not to say that they don’t exist.</p>
<p>I highly disagree that majority of Bosnian citizans objects to the idea and it is a unlikely possibility. It is a complex issue of interests and political games on all sides that makes it seem weaker than it is.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 16:10, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to note that I don't think that the article should become a redirect. The article could say something along the lines of "Bosnians are residents of Bosnia".

I believe it is user:Nikola Smolenski who is disputing the accuracy ofthe article <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>
<p><a name="The_English_people.2C_Germans.2C_Spartans.2C_Summerians.2C_etc_vs_Bosnians" id="The_English_people.2C_Germans.2C_Spartans.2C_Summerians.2C_etc_vs_Bosnians"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Talk%7EBosnians_dd8f.html" title="Edit section: The English people, Germans, Spartans, Summerians, etc vs Bosnians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The English people, Germans, Spartans, Summerians, etc vs Bosnians</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia is full of entries that talk about collective identities in one way or another (the English people, Germans, etc), so there is no particular reason for Bosnians not to have their own entry. The debate you are having on this page is about 'the national question of Bosnians', which is a bit of an old chestnut and should be left where it belongs -- in the basket of Balkan nationalism.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn't mean that Bosnians don't exist as a cultural, anthropological or historical fact. Even if they did <b>politically</b> exist only for the last 12 years, which is a slightly non-sensical proposition (since the only interruption to their political existence in fact happened in the 20th century), there is no grounds to deny them an entry based on the 'age' of what they feel is a continuous national or cultural identity. Least of all should this decision be made based on the fact that there are people who refuse to recognise them as such, because the decision of who takes precedence here is a political one.</p>
<p>References to the Bosnian people, Bosnian 'state' (in a pre-nation-state sense), etc, date back to medieval times and are widely noted, so we're not talking about a group of enthusiasts that have pulled this one out of their back-side. If there is a country called Bosnia (and whether one likes it or not, there is such a country whose existence has been mentioned for some 8 centuries in one form or another), and even if there are only two people who have a sense of national, cultural or otherwise belonging to that country (and there are more), they have a legitimate right to explain who they are. Though the clumsily designed Dayton Peace Accord recognised the country, but not the people, it doesn't mean that the people don't exist.</p>
<p>Regarding the supposed bias of the entry, there is nothing in the entry that contravenes official historical record or agreement on the issue. This is a standard description of the history of the Bosnian national question, which, in most reputable historical books, is given a lot harsher treatment (ie offensive to neighbouring national ideologies). It appears that the only offence here is that the article claims that Bosnians exist, and I don't think Wikipedia is the right forum to debate this issue. Anthropological argument could save the day for this article - if one can talk about the cultural affiliation based on the dialect, food, living space, proximity, way of life, historical background, etc ...</p>
<p>As for claiming that it is unnecessary to talk about the history of Bosnians, well, yes, it is also unnecessary to talk about the history of Spartans, dinosaurs or Summerians, but we still do, and history of a living people/species/whatever you'd like to call them, should have equal relevance. <a href="../../../f/o/m/User%7EFomafomich_34fa.html" title="User:Fomafomich">Fomafomich</a> 10:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Nikola, they don't speak different dialects. Contemporary political intervention concerns mostly grammar and orthography as an expression of difference of national languages, but not dialects. You will be hard pressed to tease out differences in dialacts if you were reading Aleksa Santic, Fra Leon Petrovic and Safvet-beg Basagic in one go. That's empirically speaking.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Morphologically speaking, the common language of Bosnians, Serbs and Croats developed from a few original dialects and the only morphological argument for a distinction is teasing out regional (not ethnic) distinctions. What you are talking about is that they don't speak the same 'ethnolect', which is a language used as a boundary maker, ie the one that is defined by the existence of a nation. In this sense, it can be said that all dialects spoken by the members of one nation belong to the same ethnolect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You will remember, however, that Vuk standardised the Serbian language using Neo-Shtokavian Eastern Herzegovinian <b>Dialect</b>, which was spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia proper at the time. Linguistic commonality of the time was more specifically defined by the existence of Neo-Shtokavian Folklore Koine (an example of which is <i>deseterac</i>), which was used equally by Gundulic, Njegos, and annonymous 'folk poets'. Dialects, then, are Ikavian, Shtokavian, Ekavian, Chakavian, Kajkavian ... and they are shared by people inhabiting certain regions. In 1992, Serbian Constitution decreed 'the official use of the Serbian language of Ekavian and Ijekavian <b>dialects'</b>. Interestingly, Republika Srpska (unless something changed recently) decreed Ekavian as its official dialect, which shows an elementary misunderstanding of the origins of their standard language - they reject Vuk's standardisation, and that is a politicised approach to language. Yet, I would doubt that the majority of Bosnian Serbs 'exorcised' usage of words such as <i>bolan</i> from their language, which is specific to the region (Bosnia), not to the national language (in this case Serbian in its two standardised dialects). Likewise, I don't think you will hear them regularly using <i>bre</i> in their colloquial expression. And, consitution or no constitution, I don't think the population of Republika Srpska magically started speaking in Ekavian overnight, so I'd say they still all speak the same dialect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are wrong here, because there are several Shtokavian dialects, Eastern Herzegovinian being only one of them. Dialect distribution does not precisely follow ethnic lines, of course. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 11:31, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course there are, that's what I said - contemporary politicised approaches to language reject Vuk's standardisation based on Neo-Shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian dialect, the keyword being standardisation not Shtokavian. <a href="../../../f/o/m/User%7EFomafomich_34fa.html" title="User:Fomafomich">Fomafomich</a> 10:43, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anthropologically speaking, commonalities are everywhere to be found - and they are simple, and non-political. For instance, there is one whole generation of urban Bosnians who describe their New Years Day experience as consisting of 'eating sarma and watching Vienna New Years Day Concert'. Perhaps that has now changed to 'eating sarma and watching Pink TV', and sarma is made with pork in one part, and without it in another, but that's beside the point. All Bosnians (as a cultural entity) ridicule Serbs from Serbia proper and Croatians for calling all traditional pastry dishes 'burek', without making references to ingredients. Only in Bosnia (and all parts of it) does the distinction between <i>sirnica</i>, <i>zeljanica</i>, <i>tikvenjaca</i>, <i>burek</i>, <i>buredzike</i>, etc exist - and it is common. So anthropology, in fact, makes a lot of sense. <a href="../../../f/o/m/User%7EFomafomich_34fa.html" title="User:Fomafomich">Fomafomich</a> 09:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, of course there are, we have more commonalities in these lands than distinctions. That was just an example. Celebrating Bajram and both Christmases across ethnic lines with certain peculiarities is one of them. Using a very recognisable slang is one of them, etc ...

<p>I am going to try to clarify the issue that is being brought up about the origin of the word Bosnian vs Bosniak. Per Damir who has added this sentance to the article:</p>
<p><i>"Bosnian" is the germanic word for the people whose country is Bosnia (Bosnians - Bosnia), the latin word is "Bosniaque" - Bosniak - Bosnia.</i></p>
<p>I see no reason why we need to begin an encyclopedic article with the ethimological definition of the word. Such organization is probably OK for a dictionary but not for encyclopedia. Therefore I propose moving this sentance to the start of the History section or we can create a separate section that deals with the origin and meaning of the name.</p>
<p>Secondly regardless of the ethimological origin of the name the meaning of the name has been changed several times in history. The most current meaning is following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bosniaks are a constituent ethnic group of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As such they use the term Bosniaks to protect their rights through the Bosnian constitution. The term was introduced in 1993 to replace the term Muslims in order to protect rights of Muslims in the contemporary constitutional system of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</li>
<li>Bosnians is a common name for all ethnicities in BiH. Since it is believed that all ethnic groups in BiH portray a single cultural identity that can be described in terms of a single nation this name is used to differentiate the commonalities among ethnic groups in BiH from uniqueness of the Bosniaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope everyone agrees on this issue. For now I will move the disputed sentance above to the history section. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 00:44, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I say we move it to the history department, not in any way remove!. As I earlier stated perhaps the ethnic meaning of Bosnian and Bosniak aren't the same but the lingustic meaning of the two words are exactly the same. Bosnian is in french called Bosniaque (pronounced bosniak), in italian Bosnian is called Bosniac, in the germanic languages bosniac is said bosnian/bosnier...<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 12:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But the problem is that the sentence in question says nothing about the source of the word. As words, both Bosniak and Bosnian have slavic roots. They themselves have nothing to do with latin and german. What the author of that sentence is trying to imply is that because in certain languages (i.e. latin) there is no difference between the words for "Bosniak" and "Bosnian" that they are then really two words for the same thing (which is, of course, false, and just the author's personal pov). The sentence detracts from the article because it pushes a fringe pov that is highly confusing to outsiders. For instance, you seem to have gotten the impression that "Bosnian" and "Bosniak" have latin and german roots respectively, when this is simply not true.

Especially when I had said nothing whatsoever that would suggest I thought that. I am confident that the wikipedia community can understand that similiar roots does not always mean equivalent definition.

Have you actually read the article. There is a significant amount of academic research in the field of anthropology done particulary on this subject.

<dd>Anthropology has nothing to do with ethnicity (btw-even in this field, there is a significant difference between three nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina). This "anthropological" approach belongs to the 19th cebtury racialist (not racist) ideologies &amp; is totally absurd and anachronous. There are three denominational-ethnoconfessional national traditions in BiH (as explained in <a href="http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/dummies.html#nacija" class="external free" title="http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/dummies.html#nacija" rel="nofollow">http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/dummies.html#nacija</a>) &amp; the page on wiki on this issue is obsolete &amp; essentially-false.

<p>This is a bold statement that anthropology has nothing to do with ethnicity and it took me some time to test the merits of that statement and I can conclude that the statement is based on ignorance and lack of research. For starters, if anthropology has nothing to do with ethnicity why is research conducted on various universities on these related subjects. For example</p>

Now for the content, if it would at all be admissible, beside the point that is clearly one sided the source presents a debate where on one end there is unsourced claim that “Croatian and Serbian names and identities are "imported" into Bosnia and Herzegovina (chiefly as a result of concentrated anti-Bosnian propaganda efforts).” A position that this article does not follow. The reply beside the point that is not applicable to this wikipedia article, provides no new information but rather chauvinistically dismisses the above claims and attacks Bosnian Muslims (?) to put it mildly as being plainly ignorant about the issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The claim on "imported" Croat and Serb identities is the central ideological thesis in modern Bosniak historiography &amp; everyday media culture: <a href="http://www.iis.unsa.ba/posebna/mitovi/mitovi_dzaja.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.iis.unsa.ba/posebna/mitovi/mitovi_dzaja.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iis.unsa.ba/posebna/mitovi/mitovi_dzaja.htm</a>, <a href="http://rb.blogger.ba/" class="external free" title="http://rb.blogger.ba/" rel="nofollow">http://rb.blogger.ba/</a>, <a href="http://www.zemljabosna.com/pjesma_bosnjaku.html" class="external free" title="http://www.zemljabosna.com/pjesma_bosnjaku.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zemljabosna.com/pjesma_bosnjaku.html</a>, ...

<p>The only statement that could potentially be taken with some consideration is “noun «Bosnian» had not possessed ethnic/national connotation in the medieval period”. However, the logic fails if one considers that no national name such as Bosnian, had ethnic/national connotation in medieval period either as the philosophy of nationalism did not exist back than.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wrong. The prevalent modern theories of nationalism differ between at least three phases of national crystallization: ethnic group, people and nation. Ethnic groups did exist in the medieval period, and the dominant opinion is that there was no "Bosnian" ethnic group whatsoever-as <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatroslav_Jagi%C4%87_e5e6.html" title="Vatroslav Jagić">Vatroslav Jagić</a> had put it, history knows only two ethnic names "in these parts"-Croat and Serb. There is no story connected with Bosnian people, even in the medieval sense, that would consider the inhabitants of this polity as ethnically individualized from their neighbors. But, this may be an obsolete way of reasoning. The point is that there is no way one can "prove" any of the following claims:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>medieval Bosnians were, actually, Croats/Serbs</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>they were a mixture of Croats and Serbs</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>they were a Slavic people who shared many traits with their neighbors, but did not identify culturally with any neighbor</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Modern historiography's chief claims are that medieval Bosnians were some mixture of Slavic tribes who had both Croat and Serbian traits, as well as indigenous ones, and cannot be subsumed under Croatian or Serbian identities. Or: "Bosnians" were Slavs who lived in Bosnia, but it is impossible to decode, post festum, had they any ethnic affiliation as "Bosnians", or was it just a political-regional designation. The point is that <b>both</b> Croats and Serbs were visibly present in the medieval period, as Muhamed Filipović had claimed in his 1982. article in the Enciklopedija Jugoslavije: <a href="http://www.hercegbosna.org/ostalo/etnicka.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hercegbosna.org/ostalo/etnicka.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hercegbosna.org/ostalo/etnicka.html</a> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 14:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't intend to deleve into minutiae of the text, but, let me state it clearly: this is the example of a copy-cat Serbian nationalism, Bosniaks trying to play the role of Yugoslavia-addicted Serbs who tended to identify most Serbian traits (not all- one example is the Cyrillic script) with the Yugoslav ones. On Eurasian scale, the crude equation would be: Soviets were Russians; in ex-Yu, Yugoslavs were Serbs; now we got the following ideologacal delusion: Bosnians are Bosniaks.

<p>Before serbs and croats entered bosnia, perhaps you've forgotten, other native peoples lived there - the rest is up to you to figure out, here's one clue; bosniaks/bosnians. Serbs and croats have their ethnicity which is either serbian or croatian, it is impossible to have two ethnicities unless you have parents which are both from croatia/serbia and bosnia. But to say that the whole serbian/croatian people are "ethnic bosnians" that would be like saying that whole croatia or serbia have "double ethnicities" and that every serb/croat has both croatian/serbian and bosnian/bosniak parents. What you are saying is that croats = bosniaks = ethnic bosnians = serbs = which means that croats, serbs and bosniaks are one people. Welcome to the future: they are not. Until the croats and serbs of bosnia prefer calling themselves by the name of bosnians instead of serbs/croats they are not bosnians - when they say bosnian they mean this geographicly; bosniaks don't, for bosniaks it means bosnian blood, genes and heritage and not only geography. A reminder for you, why is Siroki football club in bosnia called "croatian football club" and not Bosnian club. Because croats are ethnic bosnians?. Don't deny the croatian or serbian nationhood, this is wrong and I don't know what your purpose is; perhaps to "proove" that serbs and croats actually are nothing but bosnians?. Damir Mišić</p>
<hr />
<p>Firstly let me tell you something about the "province" of bosnia.and it might shock you, but get ready Dalmatia (and Pannonia)actually before the croats arrived during the roman times was actually much larger then it is today and it including parts( most) of "Present day BiH" evidence: In roman times, duvno (delminium)todays (tomislavgrad) was capital of dalmatia, and where is duvno today??, in BiH.</p>
<p>so for people like you who belive the AVNOJ BORDERS AND take them as where each of the slavic tribes soley settled ...then it shows how neive you are.</p>
<p>the borders of each of the FYR's are artificail just for your infomation...do you honestly believe the croat tribes settled in a crescent( the modern border of croatia), and skiped over neum and settled in konavlje?? If you do then the people in dubrovinik are croats while the people who live in neum are actually socalled"Bosnians"( even though they are from Herzegovina) by your way of thinking?</p>
<p><b>Your idea of bosna is messed cozz the</b> modern notion of Bosna (od une do drine, od save do mora) <b>is a recent phenomenon, as previously it was not such a distinguisable unified mass rather there was turkish Croata and turkish dalmatia (hercegovina) etc. , the real bosna is the area east of jajce and north of konjice.</b></p>
<p>here is the growth of the real bosnia when in the 11th century [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rastbosne.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rastbosne.png" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]</p>
<p>early Bosnia (which covered no more than 20% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly around Sarajevo- then called Vrhbosna)</p>
<p><b>It is Bosnian Muslims/Bosniaks, whose major obsession is to enlarge the territory of medieval Bosnian political unit in order to give historical legitimacy to current national/political aspirations that is.. to Preserve a greater BiH and claim all the present day inhabitants of the land are "bosnians( catholics muslims orthodox" in an ethnic sense</b></p>
<p>Bosnia was made up of historical provinces (Soli, Usora, Uskoplje, Vrhbosna, Brotnjo, Klis, Rama, Bekija, Popovo, Podrinje etc) .Your talk regarding there is not one shred of evidence that croats arrived in the balkans in the 600s, is pathetic when it is almost a world accepted fact that they did.</p>
<p>Yet you belive a more ridiculous claim where you allude to the original inhabitants prior to the slavs arriving to the balklans to be BOsniaks hahaha hello my friend, it was illyrians andd romans that were living in the then called provinces of Illyria dalmatia and pannonia, which was then on present day bosnia. Or are you trying to say that bosniaks are the decendants of illyrians and are not slavic and are are totaly different people to croats... thats quite funny considering that the albanians have already taken that title, and which brings me to my next question that if there ever was some bosniaks people, which i remind you bosnia in those times was 20% of todays BiH, explain as to why bosniaks and croats are indistinguishable. Woudnt bosniaks look more mediteraenean?</p>
<p>so let me explain something to you...if you do not belive that bosniaks are product of islamified croats( or slavs) during 500 years of seperation from the mother countries historical lands, and you cannot prove there was a bosniak nation before the slavs arrival can you explain to me when there national emancipation occured?? and why they didnt revolt to croatian rule during the 900s? or why there is not one recorded manuscript of the bosniak before the slavs arived?</p>
<p>so i suggest you leave the article to be NPOV instead of BPOV, and if you want to keep it that way then it is only fair that the SPOV and CPOV is shown aswell..let me remind you that the serbs and croats could be more aggresive in changing the makeup of this article..howver its up to the reader to decide what is true and what they will accept as fact and not you damir..so leave the article as it was ,as it shows the reality of croat and serb opinion.and you cannot hide that.</p>
<p>Anyways croats who have been living in the regions of Hum and Bosanska krajina (Turkish Croatia) ( as the moajority of these inhabitants are muslim refugees from the military frontier in croatia following the austro hungarian retake of there land in the 17th century) since their arrival to the balkans... The AVNOJ borders do no reflect where the serbs are croats settled... and thus croats and serbs..who also mixed with the indigenous illyrian and roman population( not BOsniak as you claim) are just as ethnic to bosnia( i Hercegovina) as bosniaks are. --Jadran 07:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes my good man, Bosniaks are the slavicized descendants of Illyrians. Only bosniaks and albanians accepted Islam in large scale, "Bosnia" stems from illyrian "Bosona" (meaning running water) and bosniaks are much more similiar to albanians than to serbs or croats. Yes bosnian serbs and bosnian croats look exactly as Bosniaks, more than albanians do, but this is because bosnian serbs and bosnian croats are simply Catholic Bosniaks and Orthodox Bosniaks. Even the real croats,from croatia, consider the bosnian croats to actually be only Catholic Bosnians and not Croats. Allthoug the croat government is lying about this because they want to claim Bosnian lands. Remember Bosnian croats were Bosniaks as late as in the 19th century when they suddenly changed ethnicity to croats because of religion. Damir Mišić 22:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>So Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs look like Bosnian Bosniaks because they are actually all bosniaks, am i correct. So can you explain to me as to why Croats from the Republic of Croatia( i.e SLavonija Dalmatia, Istra, etc) look exactly the same as bosniaks?</p>
<p>Or in your opinion they dont.</p>
<p>I personally belive that albanians do not look anthing like Bosniaks. But anyways, According to your train of thought, there must be a huge difference in the croats from peljesac penisula and konavlje ( the region around dubrovnik) and the "Bosniak" Catholics of Neum</p>
<p><br />
haha, you are so naive The borders of the FYR are ARTIFICAL. Do you understand that AVNOJ borders are artifical! Croats when they settled in the balkans did not settle in a Crescent Shape!</p>
<pre>
"Even the real croats,from croatia, consider the bosnian croats to actually be only Catholic Bosnians and not Croats."

<p>" "Bosnia" stems from illyrian "Bosona" " <b>Exactly and Historical bosnia is not the modern notion of Bosna (od une do drine, od save do mora)</b> early Bosnia covered no more than 20% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly around Sarajevo- then called Vrhbosna.</p>

<p>b) user Mišić incessantly tries to push his POV that Bosnians are some kind of supra-national inhabitants of B &amp; H whose primary loyalty is towards the country of B &amp; H, a not to their respective national communities. As any informed person knows, all political parties in B &amp; H are completely mononational- the supposed exception of SDP is a smokescreen: this is a Bosniak party, as is evident from the membership &amp; proclaimed policy. So, user Mišić tries to present Bosniak national agenda as the all-inclusive Bosnian one. Needless to say, virtually no Croat or Serb would agree with him.

<p>Firstly, let me state that I have no opinion on this article's actual content. However, this edit war has gone on to the point that it has become absurd. In the long term, we need consensus rather than arbitrary declarations as to whether it is or is not POV, which is what a lot of the edit-warring seems to be over. Basically, I am on the sidelines here, and do not wish to be caught up in some futile debate over whether the Bosnians make up an ethnicity or a country a nation or a label or whatever. After reviewing the last 10 or so versions of the page, my own personal revision of the article introduction would read</p>
<p><i>Bosnian (Bosanci; sing. Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian Bosanac) is the generic English term for all inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina. More specifically, Bosnian can refer to a Bosniak, Croat, Serb, or any other individual who permanently resides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity or religion.</i></p>
<p><i>In addition, there is a sizable population in Bosnia and Herzegovina who believe that Bosnians are a nation holding a distinct collective cultural identity. By this usage, a Bosnian would be an individual who belonged to this culture. They assert that this collective identity is capable of diminishing or overcoming existing political and ethnic divisions. However, this claim is denied by the majority of Croats and Serbs, and even by some Bosniaks.</i></p>
<p>Hopefully that is neutral enough to keep you from editing the hell out of it. If so, I would propose we agree to put it up as the new article heading, and further agree NOT to change it until the basic issue has been resolved or at least further discussed. That way, we could focus on the latter portions of the article where the actual content resides. If you have a problem with this wording, suggest a change here.</p>
<p>If enough verifiable information can be collected regarding the second definition, a possibility, though not one I would really support, would be putting the second definition into its own article, and changing the latter part of the second paragraph to say "For this usage of the term, see Bosnian (whatever the proper distinguishing term is)." --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 05:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your proposal is in the spirit of what I have already edited with few wording changes so I am OK with it. Only in the last sentance I would change "majority" into "many" as no data can be found to substantiate such statistical statement ie. "majority".</p>
<p>I don't see that we would need to split up article into something else as the definitions are related and mutually not exclusive. We don't need to make of this more complicated issue than it is. It is relatively difficult to provide a link to sociological and anthopological studies being conducted in Bosnia regarding Bosnian national identity but the link I have provided does point to at least one Political force that supports and pushes the idas that are described in the second portion of the definition. The same political party has about 13% support in BiH while other parties who may have not as explicitly defined their position relative to this issue also generally support it. I would say that at least 1/3 of the Bosnian population (if not more) would probably agree with the second part of the definition. What else do we have that is disputed?--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:00, 25 May 2006 (UTC) There is data to support "majority", and that can be reflected through RS, if the majority of Serbs agreed with the last senstence then i doubt RS would exist, nor do i believe croats would be demanding for their own entity or the cantonisation of BiH to give them some sort of self rule/power in governing themselves, It is only Bosniaks who want BiH to be a centralised state on the basis of a single Bosnian Nation. However i fully support your proposed structure for the sentence Tjstrf. But putting the second definition into its own article, is a bad idea as we all know what it would lead to, just ask Damir.--Jadran 02:03, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, that makes sense. I'd say we should leave the word majority in though, since it has a meaning in between the other options. Saying "some" would imply that it was a minority, or at least not more than half, that were opposed. I considered saying many, but that was rather vague. At least in my mind, many would imply the 30-60% range, while most would be 60-90%. Majority just means more than half. (Not having any qualifier at all would be even worse, since it would imply there were no substantial members of the group who dissented with the majority view, which I'm sure there are some of.) By using "majority" we are giving the precise implication that it is more than half of them, but no further connotation as to how much more than half, as would be implied by saying most. The secondary article idea was only a last ditch possibility if we couldn't find any agreed upon version, as I said, I wouldn't really support the idea unless it was necessary.</dd>

<p>So, we agree to make that into the article introduction then? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 03:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Upon looking over this further, I am beginning to wonder why there is a dispute here at all. What is, precisely, the difference of opinion here? Definition A states, in essence, that Bosnian is the standard term for people who live in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Definition B states, in essence, that according to some people Bosnian is the term for people who are a part of the Bosnian culture. (the comments about which groups use this definition are inconsequential to its meaning) Are the users of definition B claiming that some permanent residents of Bosnia/Herzegovina are not Bosnians, or is the entire issue here whether being a naturalized resident of a country qualifies you as a member of its cultural identity?--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 05:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
You may be confusing the naturalisation of an individual into a particular group with identifying an individual that already posseses traits common in particular group. For example a French can become naturalized American but he/she will retain its cultural traits specific for being French. This is something that cannot be done over night or by signing a piece of paper.</p>
<p>On the other hand many Bosnians already posses common cultural and anthropological traits but they are either denied to be commonly refered to as Bosnians or they are (or choose to be) classified under other cultural/ethnic groups that claim their membership by various historical or natural relations.</p>
<p>Some permanent residents of Bosnia may not be "Bosnian" by identity if they do not share traditionally common cultural and anthropological traits with the rest of the group. This is not to say that they will not become one either over years or through two or three generations given also that the traditional commonalities defining a group will probably also change in that time period.</p>
<p>The muddle starts with the term Bosniak that was introduced to replace the term Bosnian Muslim. This is a very complex issue and in order to understand it one must look at the context in which that name developed in last 30 years. Bosnian Muslims are Bosnians but some 30 years ago they were generally defined as undecideds. Also many non-muslims also defined themselves as undecideds. The problem lies that some 30 years ago a name was adopted that inheretly refered to these undicideds as Muslims in Bosnia while it neglected the possibility that many non-muslims would also decide to be identified as Bosnians if that option ever existed. This was a deliberate political move on the part of Serbian and Croatian political lobby in Bosnian (especially Serbian) as a preventative method not to allow a possibility of many Serbs and Croats in Bosnia leaving its larger Serbian and Croatian identity by defining themselves as Bosnian (They would surely not going to declare themselves as Muslim). To make things worse the same constitutional amendment defined constituent nations of Bosnia as being Serb, Croat and Muslim ie allowing larger Serb and Croat nations from Serbia and Croatia to have a fair share and claim on the teritory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hence the war of division from 1992-1995.</p>
<p>What Bosnian Muslims have attempted to do in 1993 is to reclaim their right to be called Bosnians but given the current situation and the fact that the similar constitutional division is still in force (division by constituent nations) the term could only refer to what was already homogenized group of generally muslim inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In such division the idea of unified Bosnian national identity becomes a completely separate subject, one that is not defined in current political discourses but one that has existed and still exists as a force in culture and anthropology. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
What you have said Dado is true in some respect, but the issue is also much deeper, and it is not so much denying the right for Muslims( Bosniaks) to be their seperate nation, as some people claim, but we also must remeber that BIH and its borders are atificial AVNOJ borders, and it is a delibrate attempt in the falsification of history of BIH to claim that the Serbs and Croats are in actual fact christian Bosnian(Nation)</p>
<p>Historical bosnia is not the modern notion of Bosnia (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina BiH, which is conveniantly shortened by Bosniaks(advocats of a unifed Bosnian nation)) that is, od Une do Drine, od Save do Mora, it was only 20% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly around Sarajevo- then called Vrhbosna. It is worth while mentioning that the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia encompaced much of modern BiH.</p>
<p>Now you might say its in vain to suggest the inhabitants of these regions was croat or serb, but then again its a farce to say they possessed any political or ethnic individuality and identity of being Bosnian.</p>
<p>Bosniaks have a right to (i wouldnt say reclaim), call themselves a seperate nation, but the use of the term Bosnian, at the same time, infringes upon serb and Croats cultural history. It does truely MONOPOLIZE the history of the ENTIRE BiH to be "Bosnian" ,and i guess that is also why Serbs and Croats are against the choice of the national name for Bosnian Muslims to be Bosniaks, because of the similiarity of the word, it will eventually become one and the same.</p>
<p>Simply to Serbs and Croats, Bosnian is a geographic term to refer to an inhabitant of Bosnia(and Bosnia alone), and they beleive the use of the word Bosnian in national sense(unifed Bosnian nation) will intrude on there right to becalled Bosnian, as it wil strip them of there national identity Serb and Croat,and thus be assimilated into a Bosnian nation (serbs of serbia, croat are of croatia, and bosnian are of the Modern Borders of BiH)</p>
<p>Thus anything cultural within the AVNOJ borders of BiH will be absorbed and claim to be Bosnian.</p>
<p>To give a simple example of this confusing issue, In regards to language: To serbs and Croats, Bosnian is simply a term to describe a dialect of the Croatian and Serbian language. i.e Croatian/Serbian of the province of Bosnia.</p>
<p>While Bosniaks are entitled to have/claim the exisence of their own unique language, the use of the name "Bosnian" intrudes upon Croat and Serbs right to say Bosnian is a dialect of their respective languages.</p>
<p>Serbs and Croats both advocate that the proper name for the language of the Bosniaks is Bosniak language or Bosnjacki jezik.</p>
<p>So the real issue here Tjstrf is what the adjective Bosnian means to each respective constituent group of BiH. --Jadran 03:00, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, would you agree that the issue under contention is whether being a cultural Bosnian implies that you be Muslim/ethnic Bosnian or not? (It sounds like there's more than that though...) I'm trying to both figure this out myself and to find a way of summing up what the controversy is that the average user would be willing to read through. Right now, we have the two positions defined, but what the contention between them is remains unclear, so it will also need to be explained, otherwise it will be confusing to the average Wikipedia reader who does not have an intimate knowledge of Bosnia/Herzegovia's political affairs. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 03:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Jadran pointed out correctly that the issue is far more complex and I have barely touched on it. For same reason I think it is not very useful to also include issues of the borders and language of BiH because those in itself are complex issues. It is not falsification of BiH history to claim that Serbs and Croats are christian Bosnians but a valid although not a conclusive position. I would especially point out that claiming that something is falsification is very harsh and one must have strong proof to have such a strong position. Matters of identity and classification of groups are not a clear cut story and there are several levels of identity among individuals that are almost always interconected especially in the complex society such is Bosnian. Derrida and its <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> is a good place to learn more about this position.</p>
<p>I don't see a purpose in stating what each constituent ethnic group of BiH thinks about the term Bosnians because it cannot be objectivelly written and any definition will be doomed for more edit wars, and second, the idea of Bosnian nationhood is removed from the premise of constituent ethnic groups. The premise of constituent ethnic groups is a matter of protection of constitutional rights. It is a matter of choice and I don't see a contention simply because one can found that it is not necessary to declare themselves along ethnic lines to protect their constitutional right while his/her Bosnian identity may be stronger than its ethnic one. As I mentioned there is at least 1/3 of the population in BiH that feels this way. Besides all three ethnic groups noted here already have their own articles.</p>
<p>Cultural Bosnian does not and should not imply only Bosniaks. If this is not clear it should be clarified further in the article. There are many examples both in history as well as today where many non-Bosniaks have shown far stronger sense of Bosnian identity than other Bosniaks have (for example Bosniaks from Sandzak have very different cultural habits than Bosniaks from Bosnia). For some ethnic Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, apart from their names, it is particulary difficult to determine if one is Serb, Croat or Bosniak in Bosnia while they all have same accents, habits, favorite food, common customs, interpersonal discourse etc. many of which are far different in, what Serbs and Croats consider their motherlands, ie. Serbia and Croatia. It is a matter of accepting these natural commonalities over imposed political categorisations. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:25, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>These commonalities are a result of historical pressures specific to a particular region and its experiences, the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was ruled by turkey for centuries,and as you have said Dado as a result they all have same accents, habits.... etc. many of which are far different in serbia and croatia. But, then again, even within serbia and croatia there is different culture between the SAME people, and that can be shown between for example the croats of slavonija and zagorje and there influence by hungary, while much of dalmatia and istria have a stong italian flavour. It is called DIVERSITY! It does not justify in generalising that the inhabitants of a Country be thrown into a collective nation. --Jadran 07:28, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While there is some truth in your first statement I would not see the matter so simplistically. It was not just a historical pressure. Ottomans did exert some influence on Bosnia but so did Autrians and Hungars on Croatia. It is a natural process of developing ones identity.</p>
<p>From a different perspective these commonalities are de facto situation on the ground. How we got to them is something we cannot control. We could elaborate on them in the history section however.</p>
<p>You are a bit contradicting yourself. On one hand you are claiming that there is a diversity among (for sake of argument) Croats in Croatia and I assume you want to include Bosnian Croats in that mix as well, while on the other hand you say that it is a generalisation to throw the inhabitants of a Country into a collective nation. Isn't that what Croatia is doing. If we were to apply a concept we have in BiH on Croatia, Croats would not exist but we would have Zagorci, Slavonci, Dalmatinci, Istrijani etc. I repeat the identity is a matter of choice. There is a well defined choice in the second part of the introduction with a large support in the real life. All I am asking is to let it be and not infringe upon its right to be what it is. The diversity in Bosnia is unavoidable and is well defined in the article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 14:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you misunderstood what i am was saying. Firstly i need to point out, you cannot apply the same concept onto the RH because BiH and RH are to different situations. Firstly Croats have always existed, and arrived to the balkans as Croats, and there is plenty of evidence to suggest this eg the Baška tablet (Bašćanska ploča). It should also be mentioned that it is naive to believe that artificial borders(AVNOJ) are a testiment to where each coressponding nation settled. Whereas it is a different situaton in BiH where 1. Bosnia in those days was only 20 % of what it is today, and 2. There is conflicting and inclonclusive evidence to say there was a Bosnian Nation in those days and that ALL inhabitants that reside in the 'modern day borders' of BiH had any political or ethnic individuality to Bosnia that distingiushed them from Croats/Serbs.</p>
<p>But then again <b>ethnic</b>(Bosnian Nation) and <b>cultural belonging/similiarities/commonalities</b> (Culturually Bosnian) are 2 different things, and im not sure which view you are talking about???</p>
<p>So then i agree, i think the article the way it is now, is probably the best it could be, however all im am saying is, that allowing for you to say there is a Bosnian "Cultrual Identity" could/may lead to what i said previously, and as a result Croatdom and Serbdom within BiH could eventualy be infringed upon, if this article begins to take a form that Bosnian is a Nation in itself, which some users are trying to convey.</p>
<p>So i do agree there may, to some extent be a cultural Bosnian Identity, but in saying that, it can not be said that each consitiuent people agree with this notion, but are denied by, as you say 'imposed political categorisations'. Their loyalty to this collective identity may not be as uniting and strong a you choose to believe. So im not sure how prevalent this ideaology of a uniting 'Bosnian Culture' is. And there is no way in measureing it.</p>
<p>Also there is another predicament in this idea of a Bosnian Cultrual identity, and that lies with the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina are 2 regions and Hercegovina became a pasaluk (state) in 1853. At that point, Bosnia officially became Bosna i Hercegovina (2 states in the Ottoman Empire with <b>equal</b> standing).</p>
<p>Sorry for bringing up so many thing, especially this last point wich may become a hot spot, but i think the article should not go any further in a Bosnian Cultrual Identiy because it will then leave a precendent for all other regions eg Herzegovina, Istra, Dalmacija etc. As i would like to say again Bosnia-<b>Herzegovina</b> is not Bosnia, to atleast most Serbs and Croats, and thats for the previously mentioned reasons.--Jadran 01:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How specific is this (Wikipedia) context and in what other different situations Bosnians and Bosniaks are the same in a sense that they may exclude other Bosnians (Serbs, Croats, Jews, Romas etc.).

<p>there is no concensus Firstly, i disagree with this comparison of bosnians and equating it to Croatians and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbians.html" title="Serbians">Serbians</a>(srbijanci). Damir edited Croatians simply for the sake of is POV on Bosnians and Bosniaks</p>
<p>this is wishfull thinking by damir inorder to suggest there is a parrelel..however there is not</p>
<p>Croatians is just another way of refering to croats, and there is no parallel with bosnians, which has always been non ethnic, and simply a geographic term</p>
<p>Damir Bosnia and Herzegovina is a MULTI ETHNIC country and you are suggesting this just for arguments sake(i.e croatian=geographic croat=ethnic, bosnian=geographic bosniak=ehtnic) Bosnia and Herzegovian is a MULTI ETHNIC COUNTRY!</p>
<p>Croatians= ethnic Croat =ethnic</p>
<p>Srbijanci= is a one off in the serbian language and there is no comparison in any other language</p>
<p>Bosnian= geographic--Jadran 03:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't mix the notations from English and <i>ours</i>. While <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbians.html" title="Serbians">Serbians</a> and Croatians are slightly stretched words, the respective articles do denote that they're inhabitants of Serbia and Croatia respectively, just like Bosnian denotes inhabitant of Bosnia. In <i>ours</i>, there's no word for "Croatians" (<i>hrvaćani</i>, ehm&#160;:-? ) while distinction <i>Srbi</i>/<i>Srbijanci</i> is fairly normal (see also similar disambiguation rus/rossiyanin which was recently coined in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russians.html" title="Russians">Russians</a>). In other words: even if the words "Croatians" and "Serbians" are bit unusual, they do represent the terms in question (and, for one time, I agree with Damir's intervention in that article). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a></dd>

<p>Duja Croatian does mean ethnic croat, which damir tried to deny, just see his versian in Croatians</p>
<p>he simply thinks croatians means geographic and non ehtnical while croat means ethnc, simply because in serbian language there is Srbijanic- geographic to the republic of serbia, and serbians/ srbi/ serbs= ethnic</p>
<p>its just a concidence that there is 2 words for the same thing in the croatian language croat=croatian</p>
<p>how would you explain for example&#160;: Greek? is it simply a word to describe ethnicity or geographic location?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Croatian does <b>not</b> necessarily mean <i>ethnic Croat</i>. It's ambiguous at best. It's not our fault that the English, as well as <i>ours</i>, in most cases do not clearly distinguish between "inhabitant of Foobaria" and "ethnic Foobar". <i>Croatian</i>, just like <i>Hrvatski</i>, can mean "of Croatia" or "of Croats". When applied as noun, though (which I said is rare and sounds clumsy), it denotes inhabitants. In most other cases, there's no distinction, just like "Greek" or "French". Disambiguation, if needed, can be clumsy, i.e. "of Greece" or "of Greeks" or "Greeks'".</dd>

<p>Firstly, I don't think we should place a map of Bosnia in the beginning of the article. It looks not only ugly in format but also seems unessential to me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conflict in Bosnia has not officially been designated as a civil war, there is still a trial going on about that. So calling it an aggression is just as good as "civilwar", but just to avoid argument I wrote "war in Bosnia".</p>
<p>And as third, I extended the explainations around the demographics and included som historic references.</p>
<p>And at last, I do very well support the authentic charachter of the demographic illustration based on municipality data, but the one based on "settlement data" seems very suspicious. I have never heard of any record in Bosnia, or any other country, based on "settlement data"? And if it despite all is authentic, it should in that in that case also include small dots of, for example, gipsy settlements as well?

<dd>Well, if you read the talk page sections above, you'll see why I went revert-happy on you there: This article has been the subject of a nearly year long ongoing edit war, which recently died down, but which could probably flare up again at a moments notice. If you want to take on the task of getting your edit accepted, by all means do so, but don't say I didn't warn you. Discussing <i>then</i> adding would probably have been the best course of action here. I have no vested interest in either side of the issue here, but I do have an interest in keeping this page edit war free. I have read a couple books on the subject of Bosnian history as a result of the edit warring, but all that told me was that ethnic histories are often absurdly complicated. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 00:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For Bosoni: since you say that "you have never heard of any record in Bosnia, or any other country, based on settlement data", see this: <a href="http://www.hdmagazine.com/bosnia/census/" class="external free" title="http://www.hdmagazine.com/bosnia/census/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdmagazine.com/bosnia/census/</a> This link provide census data for all settlements in Bosnia and the map you removed just reflect this. Second thing: check <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand%C5%BEak.html" title="Sandžak">Sandžak</a> articles and you will see there both - ethnic maps based on municipal and on settlement data. So, the map should not be removed. Also, map of BIH should be at the beginning of the article because that is what can best describe term "Bosnians". Finally, this IS NOT an article about Bosnian war, thus, please write your view about war into <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_war.html" title="Bosnian war">Bosnian war</a> article, not here.

<p>Bosniaks are mostly described either by the name of 'Bosnians' or 'Muslims' in English media. The term "Bosniaks" was also translated as 'Bosnier' in German language and as 'Bosnians' in English language until the unitary 'Bosanci' was created by Austria-Hungary. The name 'Bosanci' was then mostly translated as Bosnians, whereas the term 'Bosniaks' was introduced to a new translation and term: Bosniaks / Bosniaken(German). So to totally direct 'Bosnians' to a unitary nation created in the 19th century is wrong and subjective. This is so confusing, and a specific article about Bosanci needs to be written; like the one I wrote, where the term 'Bosanci' is used in its untranslated version to make understanding easier. 'Bosnians' have many meanings, one among them is 'Bosniaks' (considered as Bosnians per ethnicity) - whereas 'Bosanci' nowadays, is wrongly translated as Bosnians, making an ethnic term clash together with a regional one. Can't really blame the media for being the media, but it is necessary to make this clear to the readers, like I think I did in my version and disambiguation. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>And not to mention that the article in its present shape is awful, allow me to quote: "Serbian and Croatian emanicipation in Bosnia". What? So the bad guys are the Bosniaks who wouldn't let the serbs and croats free themselves from Bosnia? Another good one: "The <b>aggressive</b> efforts of some Bosniaks" - I will not even comment this one, allready many proffesors around here. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></dd>

<p>My suggested article can be found under: <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosanci.html" title="Bosanci">Bosanci</a>, if you disagree please give some reasonable reasons why. And not childish ones. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></p>

<p><br />
We had discussed this issue in the past. The term Bosanci is correctly translated into Bosnians in english given that term Bosniaks is reserved for Bosnian Muslims in current constitutional arrangement. When one uses the term Bosnian in english it refers to all people coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina. To think that term Bosniak has a same meaning as Bosnian is merely wishfull thinking. Historically things are more confusing but the history section has attempted to make it a bit more clear.</p>
<p>The ethic card plays no part here. It is not true that the term only refers to Bosniaks but they are refered to as Bosnians in non-ethnic sense. Much of media makes these mistakes and your suggestion only adds to the confusion.</p>
<p>That's regarding the move. I will look into the content that to noted.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 20:19, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition the nature of the name Bosanci, beside the fact that is not used in english language, will completely obscure the article and add bias to belief that Bosniak=Bosnian exclusevely.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 20:22, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Dado, let me first ask you what is your agenda on this article? And to make things clear, Bosnian Croats and Serbs don't believe that they ever called themselves Bosniaks. Their true belief is that the people of Bosnia have been croat and serb since ever! And that Bosniaks are in fact "Muslim Croats/Serbs". Croats and Serbs <b>deny</b> a separate Bosnian ethnicity and considers Bosnia as a region of great Croatia/Serbia. To them 'Bosnian' is Croatian/Serbian regionality, to Bosnjaci 'Bosnians' means a separate ethnicity! And please to God don't make me have to explain right now what ethnicity means, Bosniaks embrace a Bosnian ethnicity, while Croats and Serbs reject it, to them it doesn't even exist. The name "Bosniaks" come from 'Bosnjani', the <b>first</b> mentioned people in Bosnia, who also developed something that at least resembles a separate Bosnian ethnicity. And I frankly think you are denying much of this Dado. Yes "Bosniaks" equals "Bosnians", 'Bosniak' means a person from Bosnia and so does 'Bosnian'. Bosniaks = Bosnians per ethnicity. "Bosanci" = unitary-citizenry 'Bosnians' identity <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now to quote myself: "At the very beginning, 'Bosniaks' (In Bosnian: Bošnjaci, IPA: [bɔ'ʃɲaːt͡si]) were translated as Bosnier in written German language and as Bosnians, in English language. However, in connection to the new unitary-citizenry nation Bosanci, the "Bosnier/Bosnians" translation was largly rearranged to predominantly apply to 'Bosanci'. And the original "Bošnjaci", slowly began to be translated by new terms in English and German language; Bosniaks/Bosniaken. All of this was made to "neutralize" the ethnicity and emerging Muslim dominance in "Bosnians", so the population groups of Bosnia would be more easily incorporated into a unitary multi religious Bosnian nation." Please read and understand. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>This article denies, in its present version, Bosnian nationhood. If "Bosanci" (something created in the 19th century) translates "Bosnians", why are there then links to "Bosnians" in articles about the Middle Ages in Bosnia. So king Tvrtko Kotromanic was a <b>Bosanac</b> in the <b>middle ages</b>? He must have been before his time, wikipedia a place for experts I see. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosoni_89bf.html" title="User:Bosoni">Bosoni</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I personally do believe that there is a Bosnian nation in the way it is described in the article as probably a significant number of people in Bosnia do as well. However, some completely deny this and the article is a reflection of a compromise.</p>
<p>Now if you had any sense for history, sociology and anthropology you would probably not so arrogantly imply that your opinion is correct and what is presented in the article is wrong especially since you are not supporting your thoughts with verifyable or credible data. But lets take it in parts just to show you what are problems with your position:</p>
<p>"Bosnian Croats and Serbs don't believe that they ever called themselves Bosniaks. Their true belief is that the people of Bosnia have been croat and serb since ever!" Can you prove this vast generalization. Especially the second sentence knowing that Croat and Serb national movements began only about 100-150 years ago. Before that they largely considered themselves in the context of religion. I can ensure you that if you search in history you will find evidence cotrary to this position.</p>
<p>"And that Bosniaks are in fact "Muslim Croats/Serbs". There is a very marginal nationalist fringe among Serbs and Croats that actually finds these credible.</p>
<p>"Bosniaks" come from 'Bosnjani'," True. However it is unclear if the name had the same conotations and meanings as it does today. Again because a concept of a nationhood did not exist at the time as it exists today. You canot simplistically translate a word while disregarding the the inherent meanings those words have in their own historical contexts.</p>
<p>"Bosanci" = unitary-citizenry 'Bosnians' identity." This is wrong on so many levels beginning with the grammatical. The explaination means nothing. Just 3 fancy words put together. Could you clarify your thoughts.</p>
<p>"why are there then links to "Bosnians" in articles about the Middle Ages in Bosnia. So king Tvrtko Kotromanic was a Bosanac in the middle ages? " Excuse me but where in the article is this mentioned. The history section starts back 100 years. I have not worked on other articles to answer you why and that has nothing to do with this article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 21:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...poorly written this article is. Someone should assess it. Firstly, it mentions a fictious 1947 constitutional framework of Yugoslavia and notifies that the Bosniak name was (re)introduced in 1990... Not to mention the other facts...--147.91.8.64 13:17, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Originally Bosnian was an Adjective! Today is is becoming a Noun!</p>
<p>Bosnian(Bosanac) technically means "inhabitant of the province of Bosnia" regardless of ethnicity.</p>
<p>Since the Creation of the modern state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, English speaking countries have used the word Bosnian(Bosanac) to refer to ALL the inhabitants of the ENTIRE Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
<p>This is incorect, as to refer to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one should naturally use both parts of the name i.e Bosnian-Herzegovinian</p>
<p>The confusion with the usuage of the adjective Bosnian, all stems from the english referal to the consitutive nation Muslimani(Muslim as a nation){not to be confused with adherants of islam:i.e muslimani[muslims]) of Bosnia and Herzegovina as:</p>
<p>"Bosnian Muslims"</p>
<p>Firstly as you can see, the mistake was made by refering to Muslimani(Muslim nation) of Bosnia and Herzegovina as "Bosnian"(province of Bosnia) and applying it to the whole country of Bosnia and Herzegovina i.e it should have been "Bosnian-Herzegovinian Muslims" rather than Bosnian Muslims.</p>
<p>The same can be said with the other two constituent Nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croats and Serbs. Englsih speaking countries destroyed the concept of the adjective Bosnian (originally to be solely applied to the province Bosnia) and now applying it to the inhabitants of the whole country of Bosnia and Herzegovina i.e Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats instead of with the prefix "Bosnian-Herzegovinian" .</p>
<p>HOWEVER the issue really begins to develop when the name change of the nation Muslimani(Muslims) of Bosnia and Herzegovina changed there name to Bosniak, which predictably, as with all things in the balkans meant trouble.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is Bosniak(Bosnjak) actually also means(MEANT emphasis intended) Bosnian(Bosanac), (but came out of use in favour of the later) and as with the old rule above, was Originaly intended to SOLELY be applied as a geographic adjective to describe an inhabitant of the province or Sandzak Bosnia ie a Bosniak or (Bosnjak) and as per usual-&gt; regardless of ethnicity.</p>
<p>So today Bosniak has 2 meanings: Bosniak(Bosnjak): a Nation(formally known as Muslims)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Bosniak Bosnjak) which also means Bosnian(Bosnanac)i.e an inhabitant of the province Bosnia(regardless of ethnicity).</p>
<p>It is also ironic that term Bosniak which at the time of its more popular use(Ottoman times), had been exclusivly applied to the Christian poulation of the province of Bosnia(ie Serbs and Croats) as a geographic designation of the Sanjak Bosnia!</p>
<p>While Modern Day Bosniaks(Bosniak Nation)(ie Muslims Nation),who are decendants of Slavic converts to Islam (could be Croats or Serbs or as Bosniaks claim neither and just simply Slavs), DID NOT use the term Bosniak to refer to themselves as a NATION, but identified with the ruling class(Muslim Ottomans) and viewed themselves as Turks. Bosniaks referred to themselves as "Turci" (more commonly: "Turčini").</p>
<p>Now Bosniaks, who unfairly chose the name Bosniak as the name for their nation,</p>
<ul>
<li>UNFAIRLY* as it also belonged EQUALLY to Croats and Serbs of Bosnia(maybe even more so, as it was only applied to CHRISTIANS).</li>
</ul>
<p>To add to that, the Bosniaks are using the Both Terms Bosnian and Bosniak collectivily, and selectivitly applying its OLD definition.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>Inorder to monopolize the History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
<p>HOW?</p>
<p>By suggesting/alluding that Bosnian(Bosanac) = Bosniak(Bosnjak)</p>
<p>And you may be thinking now, "didnt you previously say that Bosniak means Bosnian?"</p>
<p>And yes it does!</p>
<p>Bosnian truelly does mean Bosniak.</p>
<p>HOWEVER! Bosniak now refers to the nation Formally know as Muslimani(Muslims) and NOT what it previously meant,</p>
<p>i.e. Solely as a Geographic designation,to refer to the inhabitants of the province or at that time, the Sandzak of Bosnia.Most importantly, it was irrespective of ethnicity.</p>
<p>If this naive use of the words Bosnian and Bosniak is alloud to continue, then there goes the entire Serbian and Croatian Cultural Heritage and History of Bosnia and Herzegovina into a GREATER (artificial) "BOSNIAN NATION"</p>
<p>This monopolization must be stopped! --Jadran 05:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am lightly aquainted with this issue and culture and don't feel the article is terribly biased. I believe people in Bosnia can refer to themselves as "Serb" or "Croat" without the prefix Bosnian. This doesn't necessarily imply ethnic nationalism. Someone can take umbrage with the appellation "American Jew" while being entirely patriotic to America. Similarly, an ethnic Serb or Croat might not like the term "Bosnian Serb" or "Bosnian Croat" without being disloyal to the Bosnian nation -though nationalist sentiments and goals are very strong if not predominant in their communities and drive this distate for the term "Bosnian." Yet an internationally recognized country called Bosnia and Hercegovina exists, perhaps "Citizen of Bosnia" should be used to describe its citizens as the term "bosnian" has become so loaded with ethnic meaning. If people reject being classified as a citizen of Bosnia then <i>that</i> is a problem. Before the conflict many people primarily identified themselves as Yugoslavs. There needs to be a new term invented to describe citizens of this country which is ethnically neutral. That would be quite a trick indeed, but seems the only way to get past all this petty linguistic squabble.70.90.38.170 10:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC) Markemory 06:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
