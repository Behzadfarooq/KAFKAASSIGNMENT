<p>The Boston College woman's basketball team played its first game <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, and lost to <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Nazarene_College_5881.html" title="Eastern Nazarene College">Eastern Nazarene</a> 42-35. In its next game BC downed Jackson, 52-30, to win its first game in the program's history. The Eagles finished their first season 4-6 with wins over <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Ida_College_ce5f.html" title="Mount Ida College">Mount Ida</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehill.html" title="Stonehill">Stonehill</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radcliffe_College_572f.html" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe</a>. In her second season as head coach, Maureen Enos lead BC to a 9-4 record for the team's first-ever winning record.</p>
<p>Margo Plotzke took over in time for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> season and she would finish her 14-season career on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">The Heights</a> with only five losing seasons and a 177 wins.</p>
<p>In 1982 the women's team joined the Big East, finishing the season with a then-BC record 17 wins, but going only 3-7 in the conference. In the Big East tourney Boston College beat <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Connecticut_3a36.html" title="University of Connecticut">UConn</a> 69-57, but bowed out after a loss to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence_College_ebe2.html" title="Providence College">Providence</a>, 56-38. In 1984-85 BC went 19-9 — its best season to that date — but found itself on the short end of a loss to Vilanova in the league tournament, ending its season.</p>

Since the 1998-99 season, BC has been invited to the NCAA tournament six times, won the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Big East title and advanced to the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Sixteen_%28NCAA_Basketball_Tournament%29_1b38.html" title="Sweet Sixteen (NCAA Basketball Tournament)">Sweet Sixteen</a> twice — in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and 2004.</p>
<p>In the 1998-99 season Inglese lead the Eagles to its first ever NCAA tournament appearance, a 22-8 overall record and the Eagles went 12-6 in the Big East. In its first-ever NCAA tourney game, BC beat <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_f1c0.html" title="Ohio State">Ohio State</a> and then ran into <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Summitt_7932.html" title="Pat Summitt">Pat Summitt</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and lost in the second round.</p>
<p>The next season was even better for the Eagles as they won 26 total games, but again found themselves eliminated in the second round of the NCAA tournament when <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Virginia_2eaf.html" title="University of Virginia">Virginia</a> edged them out, 74-70. A season plagued by injuries marred the 2000-01 team which finished at 14-15 and on the outside looking into <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Tournament_b57a.html" title="NCAA Tournament">The Dance</a>. In 2001-02, BC — who finished the season ranked 21st — received another invitation to the NCAA Tournament but were ousted in the first round this time when <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_State_c117.html" title="Mississippi State">Mississippi State</a> took care of the women's team 65-59.</p>

BC finished the 2003 season ranked No. 25 and entered the NCAA tourney with a 20-9 record and, as a No. 5 seed, squeaked by <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Dominion_d654.html" title="Old Dominion">Old Dominion</a> 73-72 in the first round, then won another thriller on an <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Jacobs_5c29.html" title="Amber Jacobs">Amber Jacobs</a> jumper, which blounced around the rim, and fell in with 2.5 seconds remaining — giving the Eagles an 86-85 overtime win over <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt.html" title="Vanderbilt">Vanderbilt</a>. Boston College was then steamrolled by No. 1 UConn as <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Taurasi_9368.html" title="Diana Taurasi">Diana Taurasi</a> and Co. bounced BC 70-49.</p>
<p>In 2004 the women's team exacted some postseason revenge when BC upset the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Connecticut_3a36.html" title="University of Connecticut">University of Connecticut</a> in the Big East Tournament, 73-70, in the semi-finals. Boston College, who defeated <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">Miami</a> en route to its <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a> win over the Huskies, downed <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers.html" title="Rutgers">Rutgers</a> in the finals to capture the Big East Tournament title — becoming the first Big East team to win four games to take the tournament crown.

<p>In its final year in the Big East the Boston College women's team finished the year at 20-10 with another trip to the NCAA's. In the regular season, BC finished a respectable 10-6 in conference play, but got bounced in its only game in the league tourney, losing 41-37 to <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova.html" title="Villanova">Villanova</a>.

<p>Boston College entered the 2005-06 season as a participant of the Preseason NIT. Following a 51-44 win over Drexel and a 62-51 victory over Richmond, BC ran into and were stuffed by former Big East rival UConn 60-46 in the semifinal round. The women rebounded with 41-point win over Vermont, topping the Catamounts 79-38. Boston College entered league play with a 12-2 record and ranked no. 19 in the country, including a stunning win against then top-10 ranked Stanford University. In BC's first-ever ACC game, the women lost a heart-breaking overtime game to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Maryland%2C_College_Park_4efc.html" title="University of Maryland, College Park">Maryland</a> 67-64. After a rough 0-4 start to ACC play, the Eagles bounced back to win seven straight games, including wins in six consecutive conference games. BC won its first-ever ACC game as a league member on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a> when it downed <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Virginia_2eaf.html" title="University of Virginia">Virginia</a> 57-43. The Eagles then won at NC State on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, 75-66.</p>
<p>The winning streak came to an end when BC was confronted with two straight games against top-5 opponents. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">February 16</a>, No. 4 Maryland downed the Eagles 86-59; then the BC women fell again, losing to the No. 2 team in the country when <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_ee51.html" title="University of North Carolina">UNC</a> dropped Boston College on <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_Road_0264.html" title="Tobacco Road">Tobacco Road</a>, 69-62. The regular season ended on a sour note for Boston College as <a href="../../../n/c/_/NC_State_515f.html" title="NC State">NC State</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_706c.html" title="Florida State">Florida State</a> handed BC two more losses on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a> respectively, closing the regular season with four straight losses for the Eagles. The Boston College women stand at 19-11 overall (6-8 ACC) and are No. 25 in the coaches' poll as of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>. BC senior forward Brooke Queenan was named All-ACC Second Team. Queenan led the Eagles with 14.8 points- and 8.0 rebounds-per-game for BC in the regular season.</p>
<p>Boston College lost its first-round game in its first-ever ACC tournament as the No. 8 seed, falling to Virginia 57-54 on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>. BC earned an at-large bid in the NCAA field. The Eagles received a No. 8 seed beat Notre Dame 78-61 following 17 days off between games. BC advanced to the field of 32 to face No. 1 seeded Ohio State University, a team which had won twenty straight games coming in. The underdog Eagles stunned the Buckeyes 79-69 largely behind the performance of BC guard Kindyll Dorsey, who scored a school NCAA tournament record six 3-pointers and 24 points overall. BC then lost a heartbreaker to the No. 5 seeded Utah Utes in the Sweet Sixteen 57-54, missing three potential game-tying shots in the last twenty seconds.</p>
<p>After the season, forward Brooke Queenan was drafted by the New York Liberty of the WNBA in the second round, making her the third WNBA draft pick in BC history after <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Jacobs_5c29.html" title="Amber Jacobs">Amber Jacobs</a> and Cal Bouchard. Despite losing Queenan, All-ACC defensive teamer Aja Parham, and steady forward Lisa Macchia, BC headed into the offseason with a strong core of returning players including returning captain and point guard Sarah Marshall, senior guard Kindyll Dorsey, and senior center Kathrin Ress, as well as star incoming freshman, American Idol finalist and McDonald's All-American <a href="../../../a/y/l/Ayla_Brown_433a.html" title="Ayla Brown">Ayla Brown</a>.</p>

<p>Football at Boston College can be traced to the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a> founding of the "Boston College Athletic Club" and the first series of interclass games held on the James Street Fields in Boston's <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_End_7b6a.html" title="South End">South End</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>, President Edward Devit, SJ, grudgingly agreed to the requests of two undergraduates, Joseph F.

Drum would become the first head <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28sport%29.html" title="Coach (sport)">coach</a>, albeit an unpaid position and O'Connell was <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a>.

BC won the first game 4-0, but lost 6-0 to MIT. Two of the original team's alumni had particularly significant careers: Lineman John Douglass became the first BC graduate to be elected to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and running back James Carlin became president of <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_the_Holy_Cross_150d.html" title="College of the Holy Cross">Holy Cross</a>, a nearby Jesuit college in <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester%2C_Massachusetts_6e3a.html" title="Worcester, Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to success on the gridiron, Boston College football has achieved success in the classroom. In 2006, Eagle football had an NCAA <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_Progress_Rate_8e63.html" title="Academic Progress Rate">APR</a> score of 982, placing them in the 90th-100th percentile nationally.

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> season could arguably be called the greatest year in the history of Boston College football. BC's undefeated (11-0) team captured the 1941 <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_Bowl_a643.html" title="Sugar Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> championship and the school claims on its Web site to have won a share of the <b>national title</b>, even though the NCAA does not consider BC one of its national champions for this year. Five members of that storied team have been inducted into the National Football Foundation’s College Football Hall of Fame: end Eugene Goodreault (50); guard George Kerr (47); center Chet Gladchuk, Sr. (45); fullback Michael Holovak (12); and halfback Charles O’Rourke (13). It included a 19-18 victory over <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgetown_University_1892.html" title="Georgetown University">Georgetown</a> before 41,700 fans at sold-out Fenway Park, that was called one of the greatest games ever by famed sportswriter <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grantland_Rice_ee11.html" title="Grantland Rice">Grantland Rice</a>. Going into the game, the Hoyas had twenty-two consecutive victories spanning three seasons. BC trailed until the third quarter, when a 43 yard touchdown pass from Charlie O'Rourke to Monk Maznicki put the Eagles ahead. With just seconds remaining, BC had the ball on their own nine, fourth down and 18 to go. Georgetown set up to return the Eagles’ punt. Instead of punting, O’Rourke scrambled in his own end zone for 45 seconds then took a safety. BC used the free kick to boot the ball far downfield and dashed the Hoyas' three-season unbeaten record. Legendary Coach <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Leahy_48dc.html" title="Frank Leahy">Frank Leahy</a> took his undefeated Eagles on to the Sugar Bowl in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> where they beat <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.

<p>The early 1980s are sometimes referred to as "The Flutie Era", and are often credited with putting BC football firmly into the big time. Quarterback <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a> played for Boston College from 1981 to 1984, and won the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> in his senior year. He gained national attention on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">November 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against incumbent national champion <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">Miami Hurricanes</a> (led by star QB <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Kosar_0f6e.html" title="Bernie Kosar">Bernie Kosar</a>). The game was nationally televised on <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> the day after <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, and had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at their own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only six seconds remained on the clock. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_pass_e730.html" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary pass</a> that was caught in the end zone by his roommate, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Phelan_e46c.html" title="Gerard Phelan">Gerard Phelan</a>, giving BC a 47-45 win. A persistent <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> holds that this play essentially clinched the Heisman Trophy for Flutie; in fact, the Heisman voting was already complete by the day of the game.

The two teams battle for the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland_Trophy_102a.html" title="Ireland Trophy">Ireland Trophy</a>. The series produced one of the top moments in college football history<sup id="_ref-greatest_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greatest" title="">[1]</a></sup> when in 1993, David Gordon kicked a wobbly 41-yard field goal as time expired to beat top-ranked and undefeated Notre Dame 41-39, ending Irish hopes for a national championship.

<p>With their first meeting in 1975, the Irish and the Eagles have generated some memories in only 31 years. The teams had met consecutively from 1992 until 2004. Over the course of 17 games, here are some of the more memorable ones:</p>
<p><b>Freedom fight</b> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">12-29</a>): Meeting at the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Bowl_279c.html" title="Liberty Bowl">Liberty Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> Notre Dame and the Eagles engaged in a tight and taut contest — a harbinger of things to come. Despite Doug Flutie throwing for 287 yards and three touchdowns, BC found itself on the short-end of a 19-18 loss. The Eagles were down 19-12 at halftime and, after a Flutie TD pass to Scott Gieselman in the third quarter and a missed extra-point, BC had an opportunity to win late in the game. On fourth down with 1:08 remaining, a Flutie pass fell incomplete for an Irish win.</p>

Boston College held a 38-17 lead with 11:13 left in the game, but the Irish fought back. The Stadium rocked as the Irish completed a 21-point comeback. But in the end, Gordon kicked a knuckle ball field goal for the winning score. For BC, it was retribution for a 54-7 thrashing the previous year and its first-ever win over the Irish. For its effort, the Eagles made the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> cover.</p>

Down 31-20 with 9:23 left in the game, Eagles senior quarterback Scott Mutryn threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Anthony DiCosmo. After a failed <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-point_conversion.html" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a>, the BC defense prevented a Notre Dame score. The Eagle offense then marched all the way to the Irish 4-yard line with only seconds remaining on the clock. Running back <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Cloud_e89a.html" title="Mike Cloud">Mike Cloud</a> was stuffed at the line of scrimmage on the first three downs (though replays indicated he crossed the plain into the end zone), and finally ND safety <a href="../../../d/e/k/Deke_Cooper_e73f.html" title="Deke Cooper">Deke Cooper</a> tackled Cloud in the back field on fourth down with six seconds left for a 31-26 final.</p>

The Eagles came out firing and withstood an early pair of touchdowns by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Fisher_2334.html" title="Tony Fisher">Tony Fisher</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Jones_%28American_football_player%29_c1a0.html" title="Julius Jones (American football player)">Julius Jones</a>, countering with touchdown passes by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Hasselbeck_f77c.html" title="Tim Hasselbeck">Tim Hasselbeck</a> as the game was tied at 17 at the break. Hasselbeck would put the Eagles ahead for good with a 1 yard sneak in the third quarter and another touchdown toss early in the fourth. But the Irish showed no quit with their season on the line, as <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarious_Jackson_bf9c.html" title="Jarious Jackson">Jarious Jackson</a> hit Fisher for a nine-yard score, but a missed extra-point by Jim Sanson changed the scenario, forcing the Irish to go for the two-point conversion (which they failed) following Jones' 67-yard punt return score with 3:27 left after a three-and-out from BC. The Irish would get the ball back once more with 2:18 left on the clock, but on the second play of the drive, Jackson's pass was intercepted by Pedro Cirino, sealing the 31-29 victory and assuring the Irish of staying home for the holidays.</p>
<p><b>Back for more</b> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">11-02</a>): BC went to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Stadium_1990.html" title="Notre Dame Stadium">Notre Dame Stadium</a> to face No. 4-ranked Notre Dame, who were clad in their green jerseys for the first time in three years and for the first time at home in 17 seasons, and the team from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chestnut_Hill_2488.html" title="Chestnut Hill">Chestnut Hill</a> brought back some ghosts of 1993 to South Bend. The Irish got a bad break when replays indicated a sure TD was called out-of-bounds, but BC had been victimized by a bad call in 1998. Notre Dame fumbled eight times and back-up quarterback Pat Dillingham threw two interceptions. BC walked out with a 14-7 win, its first over a top-5 team since beating the No. 1 Irish in 1993 on the very same field.</p>
<p><b>Another kicker</b> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>-<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">10-25</a>): Notre Dame and BC staged another dramatic battle in 2003. As usual, the game came down to the final seconds. Holding a 24-6 lead, the Irish fought back in desperate need of a win to maintain some chance of a bowl bid. Notre Dame's Nate Schiccatano blocked a BC punt late in the game and Carlos Campbell ran it 25 yards for a touchdown with 3:34 left and a 25-24 Irish lead. On the ensuing Boston College possession, the Eagles marched down to the Irish 8-yard line where kicker Sandro Sciortino booted in a chip shot with 38 seconds remaining and a 27-25 BC win.</p>
<p><b>Break your heart</b> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">10-23</a>): Boston College and ND played on the afternoon of Game 1 of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_World_Series_ea20.html" title="2004 World Series">2004 World Series</a> in which the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Sox_542c.html" title="Red Sox">Red Sox</a> met the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">Cardinals</a>. As the Red Sox would go on to shed their curse that year, Notre Dame's hex with regard to BC delivered more heartache for Irish fans. Trailing 20-7 at halftime, Boston College mounted a comeback against the Irish lead by quarterback Paul Peterson who threw for 383 yards on the day. With 54 seconds left, Peterson hit Tony Gonzalez for a touchdown and a 24-23 win. A missed extra-point by ND kicker DJ Fitzpatrick in the first half would account for the difference in the game. It was Notre Dame's fourth straight loss to BC and its fifth in the previous six meetings.</p>
<p><b>Notre Dame drops BC</b> (2005-?)&#160;: Notre Dame, in an attempt to clear up scheduling in the future, decided to terminate the contract with Boston College after the 2010 season. Thus, only four more meetings from 2006 onwards are currently scheduled.</p>

<p>Boston College earned some negative press in 1996 when news broke that some football players had bet against BC in a bad loss <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a> to <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse</a>. After the 45-17 beating by the Orange, word leaked out to Head Coach <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Henning_1db0.html" title="Dan Henning">Dan Henning</a> that several players may have bet against the team in the game, and the coach subsequently told the university administration. Following an investigation by the university and law enforcement officials, 13 players would be suspended from the team for the season for placing illegal bets — six permanently from the football program. As a result of the scandal and a mediocre 16-19-1 record as coach, Henning resigned at then end of the 1996 season.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_Eagles_800a.html" title="Edit section: Tom O'Brien era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tom O'Brien era</span></h3>
<p>In December <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> BC hired a 1971 <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Academy_1709.html" title="Naval Academy">Navy</a> graduate and the former <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Virginia_2eaf.html" title="University of Virginia">Virginia</a> offensive coordinator Tom O'Brien. O'Brien arrived at <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">The Heights</a> with plans to revive the program after the team had been tarnished in the wake of the scandal. With good recruiting skills and a strong coaching staff around him, notably offensive coordinator Dana Bible and defensive coordinator <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Spaziani_6912.html" title="Frank Spaziani">Frank Spaziani</a>, O'Brien has turned the program into a consistent top-25 team. The team has also been helped by increased exposure on the national stage due to the move to the ACC and, more recently, improved facilities in the form of the Yawkey Center.</p>
<p>Following two mediocre seasons in 1997 (4-7) and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> (4-7), O'Brien's vision of a re-built football program began to take shape. In 1999, the Eagles finished the regular season 8-3 including a 31-29 win at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Stadium_1990.html" title="Notre Dame Stadium">Notre Dame Stadium</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>. BC had earned itself its first bowl berth since being ensnarled in the 1996 gambling scandal. Despite the excitement of its first postseason game in five years, Boston College laid an egg at the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insight.com_Bowl_ab55.html" title="Insight.com Bowl">Insight.com Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucson%2C_Arizona_9259.html" title="Tucson, Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, getting squashed by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder_4fec.html" title="University of Colorado at Boulder">University of Colorado</a>, 62-28. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> BC finished the regular season at 6-5 with just enough wins to be bowl-eligible and found themselves in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu.html" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> for the <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloha_Bowl_af04.html" title="Aloha Bowl">Aloha Bowl</a> where they downed <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_State_cc35.html" title="Arizona State">Arizona State</a> 31-17, giving O'Brien his first bowl victory as head coach.</p>
<p>The year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> saw Boston College end a 21-game losing streak to ranked opponents when, in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_City_Bowl_37b4.html" title="Music City Bowl">Music City Bowl</a>, the Eagles beat No. 16 <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Georgia_bdea.html" title="University of Georgia">Georgia</a> 20-16 to finish at 8-5. But the most memorable moment of the year came in another thrilling game against then-No. 1 Miami at Alumni Stadium. Trailing 12-7 BC stood at the Hurricanes 9-yard-line, poised to win with just over 20 seconds left in the contest, but a freak interception thrown by Eagles <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_St._Pierre_2d1b.html" title="Brian St. Pierre">Brian St. Pierre</a> cost BC the game. St. Pierre threw too low for BC receiver Ryan Read, and the pass ricocheted off a Miami defender's leg and fell into the hands of <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Reed_e845.html" title="Ed Reed">Ed Reed</a>, who returned it 80 yards for a touchdown — preserving a win for the Hurricanes and keeping its hopes alive for a national championship, which they would eventually win. Despite the heartbreaking loss, the season had several highs including <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_back.html" title="Running back">running back</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Green_b227.html" title="William Green">William Green</a> rushing for 1,559 yards and being the top RB taken in the 2002 <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Draft_4cd4.html" title="NFL Draft">NFL Draft</a>; eight wins for the first time since 1993; and the team finished the season ranked (No. 21) for the first time since 1994.</p>
<p>Over the next few years the team posted respectable win-loss records and continued to win bowl games. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, BC went 9-4 and won the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_City_Bowl_364e.html" title="Motor City Bowl">Motor City Bowl</a>, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> they were 8-5 with a victory in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bowl_172a.html" title="San Francisco Bowl">San Francisco Bowl</a> and finished 9-3 in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> with a win in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Tire_Bowl_cd09.html" title="Continental Tire Bowl">Continental Tire Bowl</a>. The year 2004 would be the Eagles final campaign in the Big East, and it finished the season in a four-way tie atop the league — a year in which they closed the season ranked No. 21 in both major polls.</p>
<p>BC holds the active national record for consecutive bowl victories, having won a postseason bowl game in each of the past seven years. BC footballers routinely rank at or near the top in Division 1-A for best graduation rate and were ranked sixth nationally in Student-Athlete GPA for 2004-05.

<p>BC's men's ice hockey team has long been considered one of the best programs in the nation. Three BC head coaches rank among the winningest coaches in NCAA history, including Len Ceglarski and the legendary John "Snooks" Kelley, after whom BC's rink is named. With over 700 wins, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_York_e961.html" title="Jerry York">Jerry York</a>, BC '67, is the winningest active coach in the NCAA. Under his leadership, BC won a national championship in 2001.</p>
<p>BC's main rival in hockey is Boston University The rivalry is known as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Line_Rivalry_ef92.html" title="Green Line Rivalry">Green Line Rivalry</a> or the Battle of Commonwealth Ave, since the two schools share both the street and its trolley line, separated by about 3 miles. The games are always sellouts at both schools' arenas with tickets being nearly impossible to get. Students and fans from both schools make the trip to the opposition's arena for away games, often creating an intense atmosphere when the fans of both schools interact.</p>
<p>Recent BC alumni who have gone on to play in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">NHL</a> include <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Gionta_becd.html" title="Brian Gionta">Brian Gionta</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Kobasew_b8a1.html" title="Chuck Kobasew">Chuck Kobasew</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Eaves_4ed2.html" title="Patrick Eaves">Patrick Eaves</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Reasoner_0897.html" title="Marty Reasoner">Marty Reasoner</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks_Orpik_4e6c.html" title="Brooks Orpik">Brooks Orpik</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Guerin_6f7f.html" title="Bill Guerin">Bill Guerin</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Leetch_3cb5.html" title="Brian Leetch">Brian Leetch</a>.</p>
<p>Boston College has won two national championships in hockey, in 1949 and 2001. The 2001 championship run was capped by a thrilling overtime goal by Kris Kolanos over the University of North Dakota, 3-2 OT.</p>

<p>Women's Hockey has not been historically successful at Boston College, but in four years under head coach Tom Mutch, the Eagles have made tremendous progress. In 2006, they won their first Women's Beanpot, defeating powerhouse <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> 2-0, and repeated the feat in 2007, topping <a href="../../../b/u/_/BU_359a.html" title="BU">BU</a> 6-1.</p>
<p>2006-07 was a season of remarkable change for the team. In March of 2007 the Eagles were selected for the NCAA women's ice hockey tournament for the first time in program history. As the #6 seed, they pulled off a stunning upset over #3 <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>, 3-2 in double overtime, qualifying for the 2007 Women's Frozen Four in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Placid_2db5.html" title="Lake Placid">Lake Placid</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_Eagles_800a.html" title="Edit section: Move to the ACC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Move to the ACC</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Boston College moved from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference.</p>
<p>In 2003 the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">ACC</a> announced plans to expand from nine teams to twelve. Miami, Syracuse, and Boston College were rumored to be the three schools under consideration, and all three met with officials from the ACC regarding membership. It was later revealed that Miami had been dissatisfied with the Big East and its leadership since a formal letter of complaint was issued by them to Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese several years prior in 1999. Their issues went unresolved, leading to Miami's interest in the ACC - a league who had been pursuing the college football superpower since the mid-1990s, at the request of neighboring football schools Florida State, Clemson and Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, representing UConn (whose membership in Big East Football was then pending) led the "remaining" football schools (Virginia Tech, Rutgers, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia) in the filing of two lawsuits. One suit named the ACC, and the other named Miami and Boston College, accusing them of conspiring to weaken the Big East. Syracuse was not named as a defendant in part because they never made public comments about the ongoing situation.</p>
<p>In an unexpected turn, due in large measure to political pressure applied by Governor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Warner_ce0a.html" title="Mark Warner">Mark Warner</a> of Virginia, the ACC replaced Syracuse with Virginia Tech in its expansion vote. Things became even more surprising when, reached by phone at a conference in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, then-N.C. State Chancellor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marye_Anne_Fox_5b07.html" title="Marye Anne Fox">Marye Anne Fox</a> cast a shocking last-minute "no" vote against Boston College. As a result, the ACC extended invitations only to Miami and Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech immediately accepted the invitation and filed court papers to get themselves out of the awkward position of suing their new conference. The remaining four plaintiffs removed Boston College from the list of defendants and asked both BC and Syracuse to join their suit. Boston College and Syracuse declined.</p>
<p>The Big East presidents and athletic directors met in summer 2003 to discuss replacing the departed members and establishing a process by which members would exit the conference in the future. The remaining members of the conference moved towards establishing a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>5 million exit fee and 27 month waiting period for any other schools who wished to leave in the future. At a Big East meeting in Newark on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, conference presidents asked BC president Rev. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_P._Leahy_e8c0.html" title="William P. Leahy">William P. Leahy</a>, S.J., about rumors surrounding the Eagles' intentions. Fr. Leahy conceded that the Eagles might indeed be leaving the conference.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> It has been suggested that BC might have remained if the Big East had spun out its non-football schools and reconfigured as an eight- or nine-team league. The Big East considered extending invitations to Penn State and Notre Dame, however neither school showed interest in joining the conference.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> Several models for a new conference were discussed; however it was eventually decided that the football schools would explore separating from the basketball-only schools and establish an 8-team all-sports conference. It was very quickly realized that this scenario would not be feasible due to the fact that the new conference would lose its automatic NCAA basketball tournament berth and possibly its BCS bid because the football schools had not been together long enough to satisfy certain NCAA rules. It was then decided that for the time being, the conference would add additional football and basketball schools and continue in its bifurcated structure until such time as the football schools could establish their own conference. Unhappy with this decision, the administration of Boston College once again entertained overtures from the Atlantic Coast Conference.</p>
<p>Speculation that Chancellor Foxe, a Notre Dame trustee, cast her vote against BC so that the ACC might consider extending membership to Notre Dame was fueled by press accounts reporting that a bid to the Fighting Irish was imminent. But in October 2003, the ACC voted unanimously to invite Boston College to become their twelfth member. When BC accepted, they were returned to the lawsuit still pending against Miami by several Big East schools. In response, Boston College petitioned the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for a declaratory judgment to avoid paying the increased Big East "exit fee" that had been voted for but not yet amended to the Big East's constitution. Boston College won both decisions, but the Big East appealed. A secret settlement reported to be worth US$5 million was reached in May 2005, and as part of the settlement the ACC agreed to play a number of football games each year against Big East teams.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, this large settlement was offset by the cumulative legal fees incurred by the Big East in pursuing the litigation.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> Boston College joined the ACC in 2005, and was exempted from having to play football against their former conference colleagues who had been party to the lawsuit. Boston College officials have stated that the university will not schedule games against any of their former Big East Football colleagues with the exception of Syracuse. An eight-year deal to play Syracuse in football starting in 2010 has been signed, and a four-year deal to play Providence College in basketball begins in the 2006-7 school year.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> The rivalry is scheduled to resume in 2007 under a contract that ran through 2013. However, the series may be a victim of acrimony stemming from BC's move to the Atlantic Coast Conference. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Notre Dame announced that because the Irish have agreed to play three Big East Conference teams each season, they will stop playing Boston College following the 2010 season. Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said the conference made the request after Boston College, Miami, and Virginia Tech withdrew from the Big East to join the ACC. Notre Dame senior associate athletic director John Heisler said the Irish simply don't have room for Boston College — the only other Catholic university playing Division I football — on their schedule after adding the three Big East opponents. Heisler said that had the Eagles stayed in the Big East, they would have been one of those three. “They made a business decision to go to the ACC,” Heisler said. Notre Dame has a unique and unusual relationship with the Big East Conference, in which it is a member institution but its celebrated football program remains independent and has a separate television contract with NBC.</li>
