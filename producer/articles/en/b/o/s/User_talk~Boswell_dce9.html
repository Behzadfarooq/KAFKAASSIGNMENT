<p>Hi, I'm Ryan a wikipedia editor and I was wondering if you would like me to adopt you? I'm mainly into doing the more mundane tasks on wikipedia such as reverting vandalism and new page patrolling (basically checking new pages are suitable for inlusion) but I do turn my hand to editing now and again! Have a look at my <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">userpage</a> (just click this link), theres a list of articles that I've created and you can see if I'm the sort of person you would like help off with regards to editing. Anyway, hope your settling in to you wikipedia life (trust me it gets adictive!) and leave me a message if you would like me to adopt you, regards <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 22:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Ryan, Thanks for the adoption offer. I accept. I have a few questions although your article on Lakeland Ltd answers my first. I am planning a start on a chemical plant in Melbourne(Huntsman) and did not want to breach the advertising guideline. At present I find moving around a few articles and my talk pages awkward. I have a watchlist and have to generate that list each time or use the back key. Is there an easier way? How can I check an article in the middle of this edit? I too am a Christian. How do I add a tag like yours to my user page? Last question for the time being. What's the convention of user names? Boswell is my user name. Ryan P looks like your real name. Regards Boswell <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 04:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right, we'll go through your questions in order! For the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsman_%28chemical_plant%29.html" title="Huntsman (chemical plant)">Huntsman (chemical plant)</a> article, I'd take a look at <a href="../../../a/d/v/WP%7EADVERT_0952.html" title="WP:ADVERT">WP:ADVERT</a>, its gives all the definitions of what exactly an advert is on wikipedia and therefore what should not be included. May I suggest creating the article in your userspace first in this link; User:Boswell/Hunsman. This is because new articles appear in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">a new pages</a> log and can easily be tagged for <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">deletion</a> if they read like an advert. If you create the page there, I can take a look at it and let you know what needs to be done so it meets wikipedia guidlines before it is moved into the mainspace. To be honest, regarding the moving around articles, I generally have a few windows open with wikipedia running, so I can easily move in between pages, and check things before I edit. This is the only way to do it I'm affraid. I've got 867 items on my watchlist so it can get confusing. I generally link to my main articles of interest from my userpage (as in the articles that I've created, or significantly edited). Regarding checking an article in the middle of this edit, I'd just open another window to be honest. I save alot of the pages I use most in my internet favourites, such as the log of new pages. The 'userboxes' thing (as in my christian one) is relatively simple, take a look at <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">User:Tonywalton</a> (he's got more userboxes than me so its easier to explain)! Click on edit this page, and it will show you the tag that is used for the userbox, just simply copy and paste the text of the userbox tag from his to yours. However, you generally shouldnt change anyone elses userpage, so once your done getting the tags you like from a user, just click back. Well, my real name is Ryan Postlethwaite, and my username is......................... Ryanpostlethwaite! I simply use it because all my usernames are Ryanpostlethwaite so its just easier! Take a look at <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a> which are the guidlines for acceptable usernames (although I'm sure you probably not that interested!). Anyway, I hope that helps for now. would you like anything else answering at the mo? Or would you like me clarify anything? I'm going to keep an eye on your contribs, so I'll let you know as you edit, how you could do things differently, good things you've done e.t.c.... Hopefully is all makes sense to you! <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 22:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Further to this, copy this {{subst:navpop}} tag into your monobook at the following link <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_monobook.js_f6c0.html" title="User:Boswell/monobook.js">User:Boswell/monobook.js</a> (litterally click edit and just copy and paste it in, then click save). What this will do is when you hover over a link on wikipedia, it will automatically give you options about the article, such as view history, edit or when you hover over users it gives you the option of viewing their contribs last edit etc. Its a great tool and makes navigation around wikipedia so much easier <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 22:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just created user box table for you.

<p>Any luck with adding the template I gave you to your monobook? If you go to your watchlist and hover oever an article, something should appear!!

<p>Ryan, I'm a bit slow to respond due to my full time job. I pasted the tag into my monobook. When I hover( put cursor over a link) I get a yellow box that says User:Boswell when I hover over that link. Is it supposed to do more? I will start my Hunstman article in my user page. I have read <a href="../../../a/d/v/WP%7EADVERT_0952.html" title="WP:ADVERT">WP:ADVERT</a>, and the Coke entry and will appreciate your comments. Thanks for the help,particularly the stuff about navigation and favourites. Regards <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 22:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah the yellow box is the nav popups, trust me it really helps when you start wanting to view histories of pages or quickly edit pages, I'm not sure if that is exactly what is meant to happen, your monobook entry is different to mine (there may be a problem with the template), at the end of this page, I'll post what mine says, remove everything from your monobook and paste what I write. Don't worry about how long it takes you to reply, you can come on wikipedia as often as you want and your contributions are always appreciated. I'm on here fairly regularly so I'll try and get back to you as soon as I can. After looking through your contribs, you seam to be doing a good job and settling in really well <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 22:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Test to add to your monobook:</p>
<p><br />
// [[User:Lupin/popups.js]] document.write('&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="' + 'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lupin/popups.js' + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');</p>
<p><br />
STOP STOP STOP!! I have just requested admin intervention for your monobook, so they will sort it out for you! I've told them to copy what is in my monobook into yours. I can't do this as I'm not an admin. Sorry, should have thought ofit earlier <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 23:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">User:EVula</a> has sorted your monbook out, by copying all the text from mine so theres no need to do anything to it, hopefully popups should work now! <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 23:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think anything has changed. When I move the cursor over a link eg your name or EVula's name I only get "User:EVula" or "User:ryanpostlethwaite". I don't think the problem is at this end as its the same at work or at home. Regards<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 04:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Yuser31415. Thanks for moving the start of the Huntsman thing. Its now easier to find my way to it from User Boswell. How do you set up these subpages? I use Internet Explorer 7.0 and XP proffessional. I'm reasonably sure I'm Java Script Enabled since my wife says the PC keeps asking if we want to update it. How do I check this? Thanks for your interest and help. Regards<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 08:18, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The way to create subpages is to put a forward-slash "/" after your username (Boswell), and then the name of the subpage. For exmaple, User:Boswell/Subpage 1, User:Boswell/Subpage 2, etc. Just start the page as you would any other article. I'll also have a quick look at the Javascript thing to see why it's not going.

Good work on starting the article, you can easily see the link now here. Regarding the subpage thing, just click on your page <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">User:Boswell</a> and on the address bar put /name and replace name with whatever subpage you want to create! There won't be a page there already so just create one. Its normally best to write the link somewhere (ie on your userpage) so you don't forget it! Regarding the popups thing, Java script should be enabled if anything happens at all!! There should be more writing that just the name of the link that you hover over. Its not bigy if it doesn't work, just navigate around using different windows as I've previously said. Anyway, hope that answers your questions for now! <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 21:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ryan, Nice to hear from you. I've slowed down a bit since I need a couple of library books that are a bit hard to find. Please look at <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jukes_db84.html" title="Peter Jukes">Peter Jukes</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/k/Waking_the_Dead_9d8a.html" title="Waking the Dead">Waking the Dead</a> is a British television which he appears to have edited on 15/2/07 to include a reference to himself. What is the reference and the appropriate course of action, if any?</p>
<p>I live in <b>Northcote</b> is a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburb</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Can you have a look at the reference in this to a discussion about merging the entry on All Nations Park and tell what is wrong. I'm sure I saw a real on topic discussion here a little while ago. Last question for now. Can one do spell checks in these edit areas? Regards <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 10:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ryan, One more question. After I saved the above changes I looked at the normal view of this page. There are two extra lines of smiley faces and something about template for deletion. Those two lines were not there at the time the surrounding comments were made. Not a big issue, but what's going on?

<li>The clear problem possibly with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jukes_db84.html" title="Peter Jukes">Peter Jukes</a> creating a page on himself and editing <a href="../../../w/a/k/Waking_the_Dead_9d8a.html" title="Waking the Dead">Waking the Dead</a> is he seems to have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, however, the page he created on himself seems to be fairly neutral, I've tidied it up a little bit (although there wasn't much I could do with so little content!) to turn it into a stub article (or in other words a very short article!). His edit to waking the dead was simply adding a wikilink to the article o himself, which again seams OK. Did you have any other particular concerns?</li>
<li>I took a look at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northcote%2C_Victoria_9378.html" title="Northcote, Victoria">Northcote, Victoria</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Nations_Park_1a05.html" title="All Nations Park">All Nations Park</a> and I decided to merge All Nations Park ito the Northcote Victoria article and redirect All Nations Park to Northcote, Victoria. I did this because it seamed pointless having 2 seperate articles, especially when All State Park was such a poor article. Does that seam OK to you?</li>
<li>Regarding the template, it was originally there as just a smilley face, but the whole template has been put up for deletion, so the template has been expanded to bring to your attention all the similar templates that have also been nominated for deletion with the smilley. It'll probablybe sorted in the next few days, but I'll remove it for you now.</li>
<li>Spell checking.............. Well the easiest way is to simply copy text into something like microsoft word or works to check, I'm not sure of a spell checker incorporated into wikipedia, might be worth a though though!</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey,before I start, I'll explain what a wiki project is; Its a collaboration of editors that have an interest in a particular field that get together and tryand improve on articles within their scope. Why dont you join <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chemical_and_Bio_Engineering_cf78.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemical and Bio Engineering">Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemical and Bio Engineering</a>? Simply go on to their page and see what needs doing! Might be a good idea to go to the talk page and say hi, and express and interest in it and ask what needs doing. Anyway, its just a thought <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 19:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ryan, I found the Chemical Engineering section a few days ago and put in request for comments on the talk page. Looks very interesting but needs more experienced engineers. Thanks for being bold with the All Nations Park thing and answers to my questions. I'm now happy about Peter Jukes as well.

<p>Ryan, Following your comments of 3rd Feb above, I think I have finished the Huntsman article for the time being anyway. I have included 4 book references and would appreciate you comments on those criteria which I've read but don't quite follow. I think I know how to move it into the main space; Copy all, create new article and paste. One other question. When I look at my watchlist what does the red green number to the left of the username mean. Regards<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 02:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Congratulations, I made a few minor changes to the article and then moved it into mainspace! It can now be found at <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntsman_%28chemical_plant%29.html" title="Huntsman (chemical plant)">Huntsman (chemical plant)</a>. Well done on you first article, its great! Regarding the red/green numbers, the correspond to the number of letters (or bites) that have been added to each page in your watchlist with the last edit. Green indicates that letters have been added, red indicates that letters have been removed. How does your article look now?! <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 03:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your help in general and in particular for the formatting of Huntsman. It looks good. Needs a photo; but thats a job for next week. Regards <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoswell_a8a2.html" title="User:Boswell">Boswell</a> 07:48, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Boswell! How are you getting along? The Huntsmen article hasn't been deleted yet so thats good! Just to let you know, after <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ryanpostlethwaite_b989.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ryanpostlethwaite">my recent request for adminship</a> I'm now <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrator</a> on wikipedia!&#160;:) Hope you don't mind, but I used my adoption of you in one of my answers to questions (proudest moments on wikipedia).

<p>Ryan I'm doing very well thanks. Congratulations on becoming an administrator! I read your application and most of the supporting comments. Well done. I'm pleased with the Hunstman article. The one edit on it since was very appropriate. I will have a look myself but can you point me to references to formattting of articles and something on references themselves eg I've seen stuff about referencing a web site but can one use a brochure published by a museum to write an article about the museum.

<dd>Hey, you might want to have a read of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, this gives all the info you should need. You can cite from a brochure of a museum, but it is best to get external <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as there will be a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> with what the museum has to say about itself. I'll have a think about the formatting stuff and try and dig out something that should help you improve the format of Huntsmen (although I have to say I think its perfectly fine at the minute!), its often a very good idea to look at similar articles and you can always take ideas from them <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 22:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I noticed you were having a bit of trouble with a link you were fixing up. <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_%28Victoria%29_667c.html" title="Melbourne High School (Victoria)">Melbourne High School (Victoria)</a> is the correct link, but looks ugly. <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_5f28.html" title="Melbourne High School">Melbourne High School</a> looks right, but goes to a disambiguation page, so the reader still has to pick the correct link from there. So what you wanted was to have the link <i>be</i> the first, but <i>appear</i> like the second. Here's how you do it. Using a link like [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]] then looks like <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_%28Victoria%29_667c.html" title="Melbourne High School (Victoria)">Melbourne High School</a>. You can add the text to be displayed after the vertical bar, so I could make it look like <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_%28Victoria%29_667c.html" title="Melbourne High School (Victoria)">MBS AU Woo!</a>. And now I go to bed - thank God for Australians, when they show up I know to go to sleep (and past time, too!) &#160;&#160;:-) &#160; <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 05:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good morning Shenme, As you see I'm still fairly new. Thanks for explaining how to do the internal links that way. I've noticed that vandalism on secondary school sites is rife.
