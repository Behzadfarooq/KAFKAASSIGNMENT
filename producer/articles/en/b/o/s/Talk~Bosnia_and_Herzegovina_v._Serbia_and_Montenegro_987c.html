<p>Can we discuss major changes to this article, such as changing the name of the article, before you proceed with changes. Whoever changed the name of the article gave a poor reason ie. "more useful name".</p>
<p>90% of all reports on this topic call this case Bosnia genocide case or Bosnian genocide case. Given the profound nature of the case I think this is far more appropriate name. It is not merely a border dispute such as most other cases that this court has taken on and it deserves to be istinguished.</p>
<p>Curent name, although is typically used in the legal system, in a general public domain could also mean a soccer match "Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro". I would strongly suggest moving it back to its original name "Bosnian genocide case at the ICJ". --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:45, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sympathetic to the above comment, but would want to settle on a name that could be used consistently for other legal cases at the ICJ. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 11:13, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not only the above, but don't forget one of the burdens on prosecution is proving there was an intent to cause genocide at all - Bosnian Genocide ase starts sounding POV-ish. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaemon8666_292b.html" title="User:Daemon8666">Daemon8666</a> 14:42, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is by its current name going against the grain of what is commonly used name. Not one media source calls this case as Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia Montenegro in particular due to ambiguity of the name morphology (it used to be Bosnia and Herzegovina v Yugoslavia). I thought we were supposed to use commonly used phrases. All alternates are still called out in the article and we can redirect BiH v SCG on Bosnian genocide case at the ICJ.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:55, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There may be several errors in the article. For example, saying Yugoslavia is not a UN member state and therefore do not have standing to sue Nato member states does not mean the same thing as ICJ not having jurisdiction over Nato member states.

<dd>I don't understand either. Perhaps a few additional sources should be noted but hardly that article justifies an NPOV tag. I will remove the tag until you clarify it.

<dd>If I'm not mistaken, jurisdiction regarding crimes against humanity are binding upon all. (couldn't remember the exact latin term, sorry) Wouldn't that make S&amp;M prone to indictment and punishment iff the judges ruled that there indeed had been a genocide?

I am still not following your entire train of thought of what you are implying to. To answer your last question, although ICJ is the highest authority to make a judgement on this case it has no means of implementing the sentance if one would come about. Please make corrections in the article if you see it necessary. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:39, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was just wondering that where did they come up with the following date for the final decision: "A binding ruling will be handed down on February 21, 2007. If Bosnia wins, it could seek billions of dollars in compensation." I contaceted myself to the Court and they knew nothing about this date...they only informed me that the Court will give a press release beforehand and since there is no such thing given yet, it´s weird to me that in wikipedia a specific date exists! – 2007-02-07T09:45:35 128.214.205.5</p>

<li>There was an interesting situation here (B&amp;H) a month ago when officials from Montenegro asked Bosnian authorities to drop charges against Montenegro, because it is an independent country now. This was a followup to the same question asked by ICJ. Because there is no real consensus in the Presidency about this, the official agent of B&amp;H stated that the original suit will not be changed, because Montenegro was a part of Yugoslavia, it participated in aggression and genocide and it did nothing to stop it. The question of reparations is very complex, and it has been said to the Court (the last oral at ICJ, by Bosnian side), that this will be answered after the decision in February. – 2006-12-31T12:05:31 85.158.35.58</li>

<p>The language in the following excerpt seems provocative and possibly POV: <b>"It was concluded however that Serbia failed to punish those who carried out the genocide, especially general Ratko Mladić. Despite the evidence of widespread killings, siege of Sarajevo, mass rapes, ethnic cleansing and torture by different Serb forces which also included JNA (VJ), elsewhere in Bosnia, especially in Prijedor, Banja Luka and Foča camps and detention centers, the judges ruled that the criteria for genocide were met only in Srebrenica or Eastern Bosnia."</b> This paragraph's wording "different Serb forces which also included JNA" further confuses uninformed readers about the difference between Serbs and Serbians (in suing the state of Serbia and Montenegro rather than the Serb people the UN fails to address crimes commited by ethnic Serbs from other countries and unintentionally punishes Albanian, Hungarian, and Roma minorities in Serbia as well as Serbian Muslims from the Novi Pazar region.) Additionally, the language suggests the writer clearly believe the verdict to have been wrong, since the prosecution's evidence is presented along with the verdict in a sensationalist tone of disbelief.

<p>Let me start by saying I'm nearly totally ignorant of international law and how these courts work. So, I imagine there are many others like me reading! What is the result of the trial? Great, they are guilty of violating an international agreement. We obviously aren't going to build a jail cell around the country. What use is the verdict? Is it simply a result for victims to go to lower courts and demand compensation? If someone more familiar could clear this up, I know I would appreciate it as well as anyone else who doesn't understand what is so significant about it.</p>

<p>Under international law if a state takes an action involving another state which violates international law the state which is determined to violate international law can be assessed to pay damages to the injured state, which are called reparations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has assessed such damages in several cases and in such situation the injured state would then have an international claim against the first state. What is significant about this in the Bosnia v Serbia lawsuit is that Bosnia asked for billions of dollars of reparations from Serbia in its claim that Serbia was responsible for genocide in Bosnia. Since the ICJ did not find that Serbia committed genocide in Bosnia (it did find Serbia violated the Genocide Convention in two other respects), the ICJ did not award reparations to Bosnia.Avorkink 21:04, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Avorkink, that makes more sense. <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiastnir_73ba.html" title="User:Liastnir">Liastnir</a> 15:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the event that Serbia was found to be in violation and an order for reparation was made, Serbia could still decide to ignore the order. The decisions of the ICJ are not considered to be legally binding and have been ignored in previous occassions (most notably by the US - see the LaGrand case and Breard case for examples). The ICJ works in a political climate such that a failure to adhere to it's decisions would be held in low regard by other member States. Moreover, international law is still a relatively young judicial branch and as such decisions of the ICJ add to the development of this area of law.</p>
