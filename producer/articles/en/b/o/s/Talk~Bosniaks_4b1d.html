<p>Does anybody have any issues or comments about the introduction? For a number of reasons, it's very important that we get this part right. There have been so many edit wars and arguements over this most basic summary of the topic that it's imperative we find something we can all agree on and stick to if the article is ever to become stable. I think we should all be able to agree on the information presented in it. I would like to add another paragraph in between the current two with further basic information about Bosniaks, but I am not sure exactly what to write. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 23:27, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem I have is that the Bosnians are called "Indigenous." I understand this is a sensitive topic, but even the oral tradition of Bosniak people of many families recalls a time when they considered themselves Serb or Croat by ethnicity. i.e. Mesa Selimovic.</p>
<p>There are no problems, there haven't been any edit wars until you showed up. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>

<dd>I beg to differ. For instance, from merely casually glancing at my watchlist I noticed numerous significant disagreements and edit-wars between you and user Jadran. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 00:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, Jadran and Duja haven't reverted this article for some time. You removed this vital part: The modern Bosniaks are a Southeast European ethnic group descended from South Slavic converts to Islam, that lived in Bosnian Kingdom (they called themselves Good Bosnians, in Bosnian: "Dobri Bošnjani", "Dobrije Bošnjana"). There are newer theories, by mainly local historians, claiming that Bosniaks were not originally Slavs at all, but in fact Illyrians, who took up Slavic culture following the arrival of Slavs to the Balkans.<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>You removed this vital part: The term Bosnian is somewhat imprecise in this context, as it denotes all inhabitants of Bosnia (i.e. not only Bosniaks, but also to Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats or anyone who lives there); the term rather being geographical whereas the term Bosniaks distinguishes ethnicity.<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>
<p>I do not though disagree with your edits but please you removed to much and replaced it with worse and less informative text. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 00:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You haven't reverted the article essentially because <b>the other users have either given up trying to reason with you or have settled for a hodgepodge nationalist compromise</b> that is even farther from the truth than the conflicting versions themselves. As for your specific objections, the term "Dobri Bošnjani" is irrelevant in its correct context - as it is, it's there trying to make a political point by taking a side on the debate about that very term itself (i.e. that the inhabitants of pre-Ottoman Bosnia were already a distinct ethnic group that merely evolved into the modern-day Bosniaks through Islamicization). Such implications are very deceitful and do not accuratly portray the essential facts about the origins of Bosniaks. The new paragraph clearly states that Bosniaks are predominantly descenddnts of indigenous Bosnian converts to Islam - anything more than that is simply nationalistic wishful thinking. As for the Illyrian theory, it's complete pseudohistory used to needlessly reinforce the difference between Bosniaks and Serbs and Croats. It is completely irrelevent if Bosniaks are genetically descended from "Illyrians", partly because the "Illyrians" themselves were probably largely genetically descended from even earlier inhabitants of the west Balkans but also, more importantly, because ethnic groups are divided by culture, not genetics. Bosniaks speak a slavic language and so it doesn't matter whether they are genetically 1% or 99% what you call "Illyrian", they are still culturally (i.e. linguistically) Slavic. In the same way, Turks can be described as a Turkic people even if genetically they are largely descended from Greeks and other early peoples who inhabited Anatolia. By your logic, Turks are actually Greeks. Sounds silly, doesn't it? That's because it is, but, unfortunately, in the context of the Balkans such ludicrious nationalist pseudoscientifict theories are treated as valid opinions. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 00:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I wrote above: Bosnjani do NOT need to be mentioned, and if you respected the historical facts about that word you wouldn't have any particular desire to see them mentioned either. Illyrian popular theories can not be mentioned because they are ridiculous and ahistorical, and the Bosnian kingdom already IS mentioned in noting that Bosniaks are descendants of INDIGENOUS Bosnian converts. The ethno-geographic nature of Bosniak identity is already mentioned in the very first paragraph. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 00:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But I guess everybody are not as clever as you are! So they NEED the extra explainations and not only to have it explained in the opening paragraph in a shallow way. Bosnjani are the inhabitants of "pre-ottoman" bosnia, the adherents of bosnian church are Bosnjani - historically thought and accepted that bosniaks are descendants of these. Bosnia is most surely an illyrian name - the inhabitants of bosnia have undisputedly illyrian origins according to many local historians - and also western (i.e john fine with others who have mentioned a possibility) - turks greeks what? I will not even ask! No live this time you have gone to far. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>

<dd>"historically thought and accepted"? Historically thought and accepted by who? That's just a really bad example of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeasel_b02e.html" title="WP:Weasel">WP:Weasel</a>. Imamovic, Malcolm, and a horde of other influential historians have soundly rejected that theory. Information retrieved from Ottoman defters shows that a miniscule portion of the population belonged to the Bosnian Church - labeling Bosniaks as having descended from them in particular is ridiculous. <b>Bosnia might be an Illyrian name, but Bosniaks got their name from the country and not the other way around, so I don't see what this has to do with any alleged connection to Illyrians.</b> Illyrian origin doesn't mean anything because the only real influence the Illyrians have had on Bosniaks is genetic - genetics is not what nations and ethnic groups are defined by. Having (partial) Illyrian origins doesn't make Bosniaks "actually Illyrians" and "not Slavs", just as having Celtic origin doesn't make the English Celts, having Aztec origin doesn't make the Mexicans Aztec, having Berber origin doesn't make the Maghreb Arabs Berber, etc. etc. And the only scientific studies on the subject have shown that <b>Bosnian Croats are even more, what you call, "Illyrian" than Bosniaks</b>, so I fail to see what point you're trying to make. <b>If we applied your logic we'd have to say that Croats and Montenegrins are also actually "Illyrians"</b>. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 06:25, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Porijeklo. Većina Bošnjaka prihvata jedan <b>mit</b> o porijeklu, koji vodi u njihovu etnogenezu u srednjem vijeku. <b>Popularna legenda je jednostavna, privlačna i nedvosmislena</b>. Nakon doseljavanja na Balkanski poluotok u šestom i sedmom stoljeću, priča kaže, da su stanovnike Bosne koji su govorili slavenskim jezikom, pokrstili kršćanski misionari iz Rima na zapadu i Konstantinopola na istoku. Bosanci, koji nisu htjeli pripasti pod katolike ili pravoslavne, stvorili su svoju crkvu i mnogi su vjernici prihvatili dualističku herezu, poznatu kao bogumilstvo. Srednjovjekovna bosanska država pod vodstvom Kulina bana (vladao od 1180-1204) i kralja Tvrtka (vladao 1353-91) zauzimala je velika prostranstva. Ona je stvorila sigurno uporište za Crkvu bosansku i bogumilske heretike. Nakon osmanskog osvajanja Bosne (završeno 1463), bogumili i plemstvo srednjovjekovne Bosne je en masse primilo islam i postali su bosanski Muslimani, pripadnici grupe, koja je danas poznata kao Bošnjaci.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>U Historiji Bošnjaka Mustafa Imamović zauzima nešto drukčiji stav o bošnjačkoj etnogenzi i ne negira popularni mit. On citira brojne (recentne studije o Crkvi bosanskoj i <b>zaključuje da se malo zna o doktrinama, ostavljajući otvorenim pitanje, da li je crkva bila uporište bogumilske hereze</b>. Više se zna o hijerarhiji i strukturi Crkve bosanske i Imamović tvrdi da je crkvena organizacija podržavala etnopolitički razvoj srednjovjekovne bosanske države.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Imamović je primanje islama u Bosni ocrtao kao duži proces (a nije bio brz) i sa malim izuzetcima bio je dobrovoljan. On citira mnoge recentne studije, koje se osnivaju na osmanskim dokumentima popisivanja stanovništva i izvještajima katoličkih vizitatora, da pokaže kako se <b>primanje islama odvijalo postepeno</b>, od 1450-tih do početka sedamnaestog stoljeća. Nadalje, <b>oni koji su primili islam dolazili su iz sve tri kršćanske vjeroispovijesti: katoličanstva, pravoslavlja i Crkve bosanske</b>. On je odbacio spoznaju da je bosansko srednjovjekovno plemstvo en masse primilo islam, da sačuva svoje posjede i privilegije, on tvrdi, da je sultan davao zemlju samo onima koji su u bitkama služili Carstvu.

<p>Should we move this page to "<a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniak_people.html" title="Bosniak people">Bosniak people</a>"? I'm intersted in what the rest of you think. The majority of other articles about ethnic groups go by the convention "(singular form) people", including both thus-far featured articles (<a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun_people.html" title="Pashtun people">Pashtun people</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_people.html" title="Tamil people">Tamil people</a>).

<p>I am not sure if that is a smart move particulary since Bosniaks are usually viewed in context with article about <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a> and I am affraid that renaming this article would somehow set Bosniaks apart from those other arguably related article. On the other hand it would somewhat help with the confusion between <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnians.html" title="Bosnians">Bosnians</a> vs <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a> by differentiating titles a bit more.

<p><b>Oppose too</b>. As I see it, the general problem is lack of disambiguation of "member of ethnic group" versus "citizen of" in English language, as well incompleteness of nouns accompanying adjectives. For example, adjective "French" does not have plural noun—"Frenches" is ungrammatical, "Frenchmen" politically incorrect, ergo we have "<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_people.html" title="French people">French people</a>". As many other articles cites by Osli confirm, there are no ambiguity problems with Bosniaks, so we should take the simplest path. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 08:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to have a domain area expert (i.e. someone with deep knowledge of genetics) perform an NPOV check on the genetics part of this article. It seems that the results of the research are being intentionally misinterpreted to push a particular view point.</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to have someone explain how a frequency of a certiain halo group or a sub-halo group can lead to the conclusion that a given ethnic group is indiginous in some geographic area. My knowledge regarding geneological genetic testing is not very strong, but according to this article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/" class="external free" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/</a> we can not use genetic testing to deterime the origin or our ancient ancestors.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll have to say that I kind of agree with this user. I do, allthough, think that ancestors can be decided in some extent by genetictests but, however, not by the methods available now. Furthermore I have to say that the frequency of dinaric genes is <b>not</b> equal to indigenousness in the balkan area; dinarics can also be found in large amounts among ukrainans and german people, while the dinaric frequency, at the same time, is almost zero among native balkans peoples like greeks and albanians. So my conclusion is that high frequency of dinaric genes is <b>not</b> equal to indiginousness in balkan or mediteranian area. We should in some way rewrite that part of the article. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 21:53, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The genetics section now contains a contradiction. First it asserts "It should, however, be mentioned that "Dinaric genes" are not indicative of indigenousness to the Balkan or Mediterranean areas.". Then it concludes with "As it stands, current studies have shown that, genetically, Bosniaks are largely indigenous and have a large fraction of the ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area." I have removed the later sentance in order to eliminate the contradiction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That second statement was added on later by someone with an agenda. Either way, don't worry about the genetics section much right now because it will probably disappear with a more economical history section and creation of a "main" article over the next few days. As for sources for the culture, it's essentially all basic facts so I don't see what the problem is at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am disputing the neutrality of the whole,and I can pin-point a lot... What I can see it is just making some stupid remarks about denial of "Dinaric genes"(Theory of mutation... that Dinaric is some creative mutation from Atlantic and Mediteranian antropological type have been long time dead buried in the stupidity of 20 century),and on top of that there are citation about absent of presence in "native"Balcan peoples.From where are they are native?From neolitic settlers?.And where are theories about migrations of Bogumils and Babuns in Bosnia based on real historical events wich can be traced back from Srbia,Macedonia,Bulgaria etc&#160;?.And what is with findings of Semino and others wich have shoved some other meanings of that presence of Dinaric genes in populations in Europe-paleolitic dispersion from Balcan refuge...</p>

<li>Yes, the genetics paragraph does belong here because it provides important historical insight into the background of the Bosniak people. It debunks the popular traditional view that the South Slavs are predominantly Slavic people who somehow replaced the existing inhabitants of the region, and more or less confirms the long-standing suspicion that the inhabitants of the West Balkans are for the most part direct descendants of the same people who have lived there for thousands of years and who were assimilated during the Slavic migrations in the 6th and 7th centuries. As for the veracity of what is written in the article, it is essentially paraphrased from the summary of the findings done by the researchers themselves - it states exactly what the study found. How exactly the information presented can be "considerably improved" is beyond me, considering that it amounts to two very simple and directly referenced sentences. Considering the well established sections on genetics found on other "people" articles (i.e. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basques</a>, it would be absurd to get rid of these perfectly fine and valid sentences here.</li>
<li>Yes, someone is planning to enter information for those sections and that someone is planning to do it in the very near future.</li>
<li>I don't understand what your point is. Bosniak is a national identity, Muslim a religious one. End of story.

<p>Live Forever, about the background of the Bosniak identity I found this pretty interesting article (especially towards the middle part). Basically it seems to assert that there has been a long-standing Bosniak identity but that it has differed quite a lot throughout history - Muslim, Turkish, Ottoman, Slavic and Bosniak. I think entering some of this information might give the article a bit more depth.</p>

<li>It's very hard to say exactly what the population of Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina is, but it is definitely not anywhere near 2,159,508. The CIA factbook doesn't provide an exact number of Bosniaks but merely a percentage, and then proceeds to give us a separate population estimate. As I said earlier, there is no reason to doubt their estimate that the country is 48% Bosniak - it seems perfectly valid. Their population figures are almost certainly faulty, however, because they add in population figures for the FBiH that include hundreds-of-thousands of diasporans. The European Union population estimates don't make the same mistake and they give a figure of approximately 3,800,000. Now, as I'm assuming we all agree that 48% is a reasonable estimate for Bosniak composition of BiH population; we are merely left to choose between the EU estimate and the U.S.A. estimate. The latter implies that after genocide, ethnic cleansing, a declining birth rate, and massive emigration (war and post-war); Bosnia and Herzegovina actually gained 200,000 people. I think the choice is clear.</li>
<li>Thank you whoever added the IPA pronunciation of the native word. That is a constructive improvement.</li>
<li>”Slavic” or “Slavic-speaking”. Again, somebody obviously has a problem with portraying Bosniaks as Slavic so they’re trying to replace the wording with euphemisms that are easier for them to handle. The fact of the matter is that this change makes absolutely no sense; Slavs are a linguistic group, so what else does it mean to be “Slav” than to be “Slav-speaking”? The former version stays because the latter presumably intends to imply that Bosniaks aren’t “really Slav” (whatever that’s supposed to mean).</li>
<li>Making “indigenous converts to Islam” link to the Bosnian church is just plain wrong. Read Malcolm’s “A Short History” or Imamovic’s “History of the Bosniak People” – the Bosnian church was a very small and insignificant presence by the time Islamicization was underway. Most converts to Islam were (at least nominally) Catholic and Orthodox.</li>
<li>"their tie to the Bosnian historical region” or “their historical tie to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian region”. I’m honestly surprised you’d oppose this, but let me spell it out for you anyways. It’s important to note “Bosnian historical” region instead of “Bosnian-Herzegovinian region” because the former includes all territories historically considered part of or affiliated with Bosnia (including Herzegovina, Sandzak, etc.) whereas the latter confines this to the modern-day state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</li>
<li>The issue of having a separate section on the name… I would prefer that it stays with the introductory paragraph and would hope you’d reconsider. The situation really isn’t that complicated right now. I would, however, support eventually adding a section on “Etymology” similar to the one on the Bosnian Wikipedia – provided that it’s well referenced. The etymology section could perhaps, if you guys wish, explain what it is mentioned in the introductory paragraph in more detail. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 21:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vrijedne su naročite pažnje religiozne i socijalne prilike ove zemlje prije turskog osvajanja. Većina tamošnjeg stanovništva pripadala je kršćanskoj heretičkoj sekti bogumila. Ovi šizmatici su od XIII stoljeća bili izvrgnuti progonima papa. Čak su pape protiv njih nekoliko puta preporučivali krstaški rat (papa Honorus III - 1221. godine, Gregori IX - 1238. godine, Innocent IV - 1246. godine i Benedict XII - 1337. godine. Inkvizicija je osnovana 1291. godine)Patnje koje su trpjeli bogumili u XV stoljeću postale su tako nesnošljive da su se radi svog spasa obraćali Turcima za samilost, jer su grubi postupci i pritisci bosanskog kralja i svećenstva bili takvi da im nema primjera. Njih četrdeset hiljada pobjeglo je u susjedne zemlje. Oni što nisu pobjegli poslani su u Rim, okovani u lance. Međutim, ove grozne mjere malo su usluge učinile umanjivanju bogumila u Bosni, jer se priča da je ova hereza jednako bila jaka i u 1462. godini.Sljedeće godine, kada je sultan Mehmed II podvrgao Bosnu, tamošnji su katolici napustili svoj kraj. Ključe Bobovca, prijestonice kraljeve, predao je Turcima njegov namjesnik koji je bio bogumil. Pošto su se i druga mjesta i utvrde povele za njim, za jednu sedmicu palo je sultanu u ruke oko sedamdeset utvrđenih mjesta. Mehmed II priključio je i Bosnu ostalim osvojenim krajevima. Otada se više ništa ne čuje o bogumilima. Misli se da su po turskom osvajanju u velikom broju prigrlili islam. Većina je katolika iselila u susjednu Austriju i Mađarsku, a za preostale se misli da su se mnogi od njih poveli za primjerom pređašnjih obraćenika. Neki su Evropljani pretpostavili da je mnogobrojno obraćenje bogumila u islam bilo u početku turskog osvajanja s tom namjerom da se povrate u svoju naročitu sektu, čim im se u budućnosti pruži prilika. Kao dokaz za ovu tvrdnju oni navode da su bogumili, zbog gore spomenutog stradanja i pritiska, našli zgodan put kako će namjerno zanijekati svoju staru vjeru (katoličanstvo), te budući da im se kasnije nije pružila očekivana prilika u povratak, to se napokon namjera njihovih pređa zaboravila. Obično je ovakva pretpostavka samo nagađanje, te se na nju, kao nepobitni dokaz, ne može osloniti. Mi smatramo jačim razlogom to što su bogumili pomiješani s muslimanima bili skloni islamu zbog mnogih tačaka u njihovom vjerovanju koje su slične islamskom učenju. Bogumili su odbacivali obožavanje Marije, ustanovu krštenja i sve vrste klera. Krst su, kao znamen vjere, mrzili. Smatrali su idolopoklonstvom upućivanje molitvi slikama i kipovima svetaca i relikvijama (moćima). Protivno katoličkim crkvama, koje su nedostojno ukrašene slikama, njihovi su hramovi bili skromni i jednostavni. Kao i muslimani, imali su hrđavo mišljenje o crkvenim zvonima, koja su nazivali "satanske trube". Vjerovali su da nije Isus lično razapet, nego da je to bio neki iluzorni lik, te su se u ovom pogledu djelomično slagali s Kur'anom (Njihova je tvrdnja: "Mi smo ubili Mesiju Isaa, sina Merjemina, Božjeg poslanika. Niti su ga ubili niti razapeli, nego im se tako pričinilo." - Sura IV, An Nisa', 157). Osuđivanje alkohola i sklonost asketskom životu i jednostavnosti spadaju u one sklonosti koje su poslužile zbližavanju bogumila s islamom. I oni su se pet puta dnevno molili. Često su puta padali na koljena i izražavali blagodarnost Bogu. Prema tome, za njihovo sudjelovanje pri molitvi u džamiji izgleda da nije trebalo velike preinake. Ovdje sam sakupio neke tačke koje su slične sa propisima islama, a koje se nalaze u šizmatičkoj sekti bogumila. Međutim, u bogumilskom vjerovanju ima i takvih tačaka koje sadrže formu kršćanskih propisa da ih pobožni muslimani ne mogu smatrati dostojnim za primanje. Dok su zajedničke tačke ovako nabrojene, može se zaključiti da su se uvjerili u potrebu postepenog napuštanja onih vjerovanja koje islam ne trpi. Njihovo vjerovanje, slično dualizmu manihejaca, nije se moglo izmiriti s vjerovanjem muslimana, ali je islam uvijek bio tolerantan (napisano 1913.!) prema ovakvim religioznim rasuđivanjima, samo pod tim uvjetom da ova svoja šizmatička naziranja ne izjavljuje. Turci, da omile svoju vjeru Bošnjacima, po svom poznatom običaju nagovarali su ih nuđenjem svih vrsta materijalnih i duhovnih probitaka. Svima onima koji su prigrlili islam osiguravali su vlasništvo svega njihovog posjeda, a spahije su bile oslobođene od poreza. Moguće je da su mnogi od islamiziranih pripadali plemstvu i bili lenski gospodari, te zbog svoje hereze prema katolicima bili prije lišeni tih prava. Napokon, uključivši se pobjedničkoj vjeri, uhvatili su priliku da povrate svoje vlasništvo. Bosanski su muslimani sačuvali svoju narodnost, te do dan-danas nosili prezimena kršćanska i govorili nacionalnim jezikom. Istovremeno su uvijek bili sa revnošću i oduševljenjem privrženi vjeri. Staro viteško držanje muslimana plemića, predana privrženost islamu, pored njihovog upliva i moći uvijek su na njih svraćali naročitu pažnju. Nekima su od njih povjeravana važna zvanična mjesta. Dapače, između 1544. i 1611. godine, zauzimala su devetorica od njih predsjedništvo vlade.</p>

<p>I feel obligated to correct these serious mis-interpretations on Noel Malcolm and John Fine among some users at wikipedia. <b>Non</b> of these two object that the Bosnian church was predominantly bogomil, if you for example visit Malcolm's Bosnian institute you will see that he writes that: "the Bosnian Church (with its supposedly Bogomil beliefs)". Now I'm not especially good at English I guess, but I do know that the word "supposedly" implies "the most likely" so to speak. But I do on the other hand agree with the fact that there weren't many Bogomils (adherents of the bosnian church) left when the turks came, simply because they had been practicly forced to convert to Catholicism and in a much smaller extent orthodoxism. But we also know that these "bosnian catholics" in most cases remained true to the bogomil-bosnian tradition but "officially" changed to catholicism to avoid persecution - these bogomil bosnians - who officially recognized themselves as catholics - were the same who took Islam. So catholicism is a later part of bosnian history - bosnian church is earlier than that. First bosniaks were bogomils, then "catholics" and muslims in general. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>

Would it be appropriate if we put on Croats article [+Bunjevci, +Shokci, +Krasovani, etc...] or on Serbs article [+Gorani, +Montenegrins, +Krashovans, or God forbid +Macedonians]?

<p>There is a problem in this paragraph&#160;:</p>
<p>"It is believed that Bosniak identity was lost among these people due to Turkish assimilation laws in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Bosniak immigrants to Turkey were required to change their names to Turkish or Turkish sounding ones(under the Law on Family names). As a consequence of this, today some Turks do have somewhat Slavic sounding surnames. However some also have entirely Slavic surnames, the most common one probably being "Kiliç" spelled in Turkish as compared to the Bosnian version which is spelled "Kilić"."</p>
<p>"Kiliç" is a popular name in Turkey and it is Turkish. It means "sword" and does not have any linguistic relation with the Bosnian word "Kilić".</p>

<p>Mesa Selimovic, was a muslim by religion, but by ethnicity he declared himself a SERB, AND NOT A Bosniak Many Serbs declared themselves Turks during the Ottoman occupation, but that is the language of the times and not an accurate description!

<p>After reading this article, I am confused about what 'Bosniak' entails... To be Bosniak:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must one have been born in Bosnia or is that not necessary?</li>
<li>If not born there, is it one's close personal ties to Bosnia that makes one Bosniak?</li>
<li>Must one be Muslim?</li>
<li>Must one have ancestral Muslim/Arab/Turkish etc. roots?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believed (not so sure anymore) that to be Bosniak one must (1) have close personal ties to Bosnia, (2) have Muslim/Arab/Turkish etc. roots, and (3) also practice Islam. If one does not practice Islam, but has close personal ties to Bosnia, they are Bosnian, not Bosniak. And also, since Bosniak entails an ethnic group, ethniciy is strongly dependent on ancestry. Therefore, one who has Serb, Croat, Italian, Spanish, etc. ancestry, but is Muslim, and feels a strong personal connection to Bosnia should not call themself Bosniak.</p>
<p>Am I right? Am I wrong? Correct me if I am. (Especially regarding the religion part). What are people's opinions? Any atheist/agnostic Bosniaks here who want to expand on their take on this? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 10:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</p>

<dd>According to widely accepted modern treatment, a member of ethnic group X is anyone who feels like a member of ethnic group X. The unifying traits such as language, ancestry or religion are just guidelines and, except for few oddities (<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> e.g.) don't have a particular bearing. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 08:19, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm... I would agree with you that a member of ethnic group X is anyone who feels like a member of ethnic group X, except ... the word 'ethnic' is there for a reason. Don't you think? I mean, to be part of an ethnic group implies that you have certain shared characteristics: race, religion, and whatnot.</dd>
<dd>And another thing, if we were to find out the demographics of a certain country, having to ask people which ethnic group they feel they are part of would be very time consuming, so many times this is done by assessing religion, ancestry, etc.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to say it's 'whatever one feels like' but it seems like some ethnic groups should have specific characteristics, especially in places such as ex-Yu, where the lines tend to get blurred, and it gets confusing and complicated... but then again, maybe we should start blurring the lines there more... it might lead to good things hehe

<dd>Well here are answers to your questions: to be Bosniak you have to be of Slavic origin, to have personal historical ties to historical Bosnia (not current one because historical Bosnia included some other areas too, for example Sandžak), and to have personal historical ties to Islam (but not necessary to be believer since many Bosniaks are in fact atheists). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 15:47, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or - you could be simply a Moslem Serb/Croat (and have nothing to do with Bosnia). Such is the case with even the Father of the Bosniac nation, Alija Izetbegovic - he's family's from Belgrade and has nothing to do with Bosnia at all and he was a Muslim Serb (just like his family all the way from Ottoman ages). --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 17:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the problem is that this word has not always meant what it means now. Currently it is the correct way to refer to the ethnic group previously know as Bosnian Muslims. This term is considered incorrect because Bosniaks are also found outside of Bosnia in lands which were previously Bosnian and there are a large number of non-religious or non-muslim Bosniaks. In the SFRY (former Yugoslavia) Muslim with a capital M referred to the ethnic group and muslim (lower case m) referred to the religous followers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.27.104.3_6061.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.27.104.3">216.27.104.3</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.27.104.3.html" title="User talk:216.27.104.3">talk</a>) 05:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>EGO Just draw parallel between Switzerland and Bosnia. There are no SWITZERIANS,there are French,German and Italian linguistic and ethnic groups. I understand that it is dificullt for muslims from Bosnia to admit their Serbian or Croatian background. They are like part of river cut from mainflow. But i advice all the people to read history and not pseudo-history. And it is sad that borders of today are not drawn neither historicaly neither by ethnicity. It is important to have in mind that Bysantian ruler-Konstantin the 7th named Bosnia(land around river of the same name) explicitly state of the Serbs. Name of the state could be taken from ethnical(Croatia,serbia,England) or geographical(Switzerland,Moldavia,Austria,BOSNIA) background. Those are the facts that are well known and not hidden in some pseudo-historical lectures. After all,we are all one people torn apart by religion(which wrote the most of the bloody and sad pages in worlds history. Zanimljivo je sto Hamburski Nijemac uopste nemoze da razumije Nijemca iz Bavarije ali ipak zive u istoj zemlji,imaju stardandizovan jezik i obojica kazu za sebe da su Nijemci.Svakoga ko moze procitat ovo ja smatram svojim bratom a za kraj parafraziracu Andrica:Tko ti iskopa oko?Brat.Zato je rana tako duboka i krvava.</p>

<dd>RE EGO... Also by this logic there are no Americans since they are really British, French, German, Polish, Chinese, Mexican, Cuban, Columbian, Irish... Also there are no Canadians, only British, French... Bosnia came into being over 1000 years ago. There was a Bosnian church seperate from the orthodox and catholic churches. In reality everyone is really a part of something bigger. Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Bulgarians are all South Slavs. This doesn't change the fact that they are also something else.</dd>

The bottom line is: all the Balkan peoples are a mix of indigenous peoples and settlers, the genetic issue is moot, and similar conclusions be reached (or not reached) for all neighboring peoples. (See related <a href="http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/nm/kosovo.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/nm/kosovo.html" rel="nofollow">Noel Malcolm's book</a> which pertains more to Kosovo, but I don't see a reason why it should be much different elsewhere around).</li>
<li>The "genetic evidence" presented here and in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bosniaks_d84d.html" title="History of Bosniaks">History of Bosniaks</a> is inconclusive as well.</li>

<p>Duja listen, why don't you allow me to write this text-piece (without a "cite") when you agree with the pretty much same statement in the serbian article (without a cite)? I'm starting to believe this is a missunderstanding. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncient_Land_of_Bosoni_5d1f.html" title="User:Ancient Land of Bosoni">Ancient Land of Bosoni</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Here goes a longish story: ideally, every statement in every article should be <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, preferrably using &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tags. On one hand, it provides the proof that the editor did not make it up and thus provides a ground for the assertion. On the other hand, especially in the past, citing was far more sloppy (which I confess to have done myself). Of course, citing should not be overdone for trivial statements ("sky is blue"), summary sentences, as well as for non-controversial articles written from one or two sources (when it suffices to put the "References" section at the bottom). If you read any <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, you'll see what I mean.</dd>
<dd>Now, since obviously we're far from that ideal goal in many articles, marking the statements with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} mostly serves as the marker for <i>controversial</i> or <i>doubtful</i> statements. When the entire article is uncited, it normally suffices to put {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} at the top instead of spreading <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> all over the article (like I just did on <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Serbs_c6b7.html" title="Origin of Serbs">Origin of Serbs</a>). In yet other cases, the lack of citation simply goes by, as no one seriously questions the validity of assertions in e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_5703.html" title="SpongeBob">SpongeBob</a> (although they should).<br /></dd>
<dd>So, even if we kind of reached a compromise about the sentence, neither you nor I have proven that it were or weren't Illyrians or Goths involved. Since this article (among others) does cause a great deal of controversy, it should be cited far better.</dd>
<dd>As a counterexample, look at far more controversial <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>, where every citation was painstakingly analysed and put during the course of time.

<p>I'd like to make small protest about a certain point made in the article. There are several points where it is implied that "Muslims" (Muslimani) and "Bosnians" (Bosanci) are Bosniaks who just haven't realized it yet. This smells of the same kind of nationalism used by other parties in the Balkans to claim that Bosniaks are converted Serbs and Croats. As a person from Sandzak, I can testify that many of my friends still living in Priboj, Novi Pazar etc. call themselves Muslimani or Sandzaklije. There are many cases of this, and many simply don't identify with the Bosniak nation! Muslimani were recognized as a constituant people of yugoslavia. Negating their existence has no place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Example.</p>

<p>Hi all. I'm currently mediating a case into which this article is involved.</p>

<p>For a successful mediation, I need to hear every position and its arguments.</p>
<p>In order to keep mediation-related stuff all together, I prefer if we discuss on the mediation page rather than here.</p>

<dd>There are absolutely no sources that claim "Bosnian Muslim" is considered an offensive term. And it is by far, the most widespread term in the English speaking world - most people would never have heard of the term "Bosniak" before coming to Wikipedia.

Google hits for "Bosniaks" or Bosniaks is almost <b>five times lower</b> than fon "Bosnian Muslims", so I think a source is vital for those claims.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 08:48, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bosniak became the official term when the Bosnian constitution was written.

What exactly was the weasel word? Your edit comment did not make much sense to me. I added fact templates, yet they were removed <i>with no reasons assigned</i>. What's going on? You've never edited this article before, how come you "suddenly" turned up? Were you following me or perhaps <b>did "someone" ask you to come</b>?

<dd>Please assume good faith and stop accusing other users. I asked Khoikhoi in his talk page to lock a page (Masoud Rajavi) and some hours later I looked at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Khoikhoi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Khoikhoi" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (I don't think it is any "bad" to do this) to find out what he/she has done for it. And by his three revert to this article, my curiosity led me to review the talk.</dd>
<dd>If these people really get offended by calling them Bosnian Muslim, I don't see any reason for your edits, I will try to find more sources for this. and the the changing of weasel words is&#160;: ( also -&gt; more often) you wanted to change the impact of the article to the reader, by changing those words and pushing your own POV; If I find any other sources, I will come back to this article. --<a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">Pejman47</a> 15:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you had "reviewed the talk", you would have noticed <b>in the section above this</b> that a google test returns <i>five times</i> more hits for "Bosnian Muslims" than "Bosniaks" and "Bosniacs" put together - I think this demonstrates which is "more common in English" and also raises questions on the soundness of this article's present title. "If these people really get offended by calling them Bosnian Muslim" - there is no proof that they do (which is why I added the fact templates which you removed). Reliable sources use the term, so my edit is justified (all explained by my and another in the section above this). All these plainly obvious and pointed out facts were unknown to you which as far as I can see discharges the requirement to assume good faith within reason. The guideline does not require one to assume good faith to the point of absurdity, remember that and don't ask people to do so.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 00:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
