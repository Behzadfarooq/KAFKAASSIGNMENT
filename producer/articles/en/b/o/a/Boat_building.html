<p>Each part of the hull has a different name and purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_%28ship%29.html" title="Bow (ship)">bow</a> - the front and generally sharp end of the hull. It is designed to reduce the resistance of the hull cutting through water and should be tall enough to prevent water from easily washing over the top of the hull.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulkhead_%28partition%29.html" title="Bulkhead (partition)">bulkhead</a> - the internal walls of the hull</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chines.html" title="Chines">chines</a> - are long, longitudinal strips on <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroplaning.html" title="Hydroplaning">hydroplaning</a> hulls that deflect downwards the spray that is produced by the hull when it travels at speed in the water. The term also refers to distinct changes in angle of the hull sections, where the bottom blends into the sides of a flat bottomed skiff, for instance. A hull may have 2 or more chines to allow an approximation of a round bottomed shape with flat panels. It also refers to the longitudinal members inside the hull which support the edges of these panels.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/c/Deck_%28ship%29.html" title="Deck (ship)">deck</a> - the top surface of the hull keeps water and weather out of the hull and allows the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew.html" title="Crew">crew</a> to stand safely and operate the boat more easily. It stiffens an enclosed hull.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunwale.html" title="Gunwale">gunwale</a> - The upper longitudinal structural member of the hull. Cannons were bolted to this in the earliest gun armed warships.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keel.html" title="Keel">keel</a> - the main central member along the length of the bottom of the boat. It is an important part of the boat's <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure.html" title="Structure">structure</a> which also has a strong influence on its turning performance and, in sailing boats, resists the sideways pressure of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind.html" title="Wind">wind</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keelson.html" title="Keelson">keelson</a> - an internal beam fixed to the top of the keel to strengthen the joint of the upper members of the boat to the keel</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudder.html" title="Rudder">rudder</a> - a steering device at the rear of the hull created by a turnable blade on a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical.html" title="Vertical">vertical</a> <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_rotation.html" title="Axis of rotation">axis</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheer.html" title="Sheer">sheer</a> - the generally curved shape of the top of the hull. The sheer is traditionally lowest amidships to maximize freeboard at the ends of the hull. Sheers can be reverse, higher in the middle, to maximize space inside or straight or a combination of shapes.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stem" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:stem">stem</a> - a continuation of the keel upwards at the front of the hull</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat_building.html" title="Edit section: Construction Materials and Methods">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Construction Materials and Methods</span></h2>
<p>A wide variety of materials are used in boat building:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood.html" title="Wood">Wood</a> - The traditional boat building material that was and is still used for hull and spar construction. It is buoyant, cheap, widely available and easily worked. It is not particularly abrasion resistant and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisims are allowed to penetrate the wood. Rot resistant woods such as cedar and oak are generally selected for wooden boat construction. <a href="../../../a/d/h/Adhesive.html" title="Adhesive">Glue</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screw.html" title="Screw">screws</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nail_%28engineering%29.html" title="Nail (engineering)">nails</a> are used to join the wooden components. Some types of wood construction include:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carvel_%28boat_building%29.html" title="Carvel (boat building)">Carvel</a></b>, in which a smooth hull is formed by wooden planks attached to a frame. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some water proof substance. It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranian.</li>
<li>Another method of building wooden boats is <b><a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinker_%28boat_building%29.html" title="Clinker (boat building)">lapstrake</a></b>, a technique originally identified with the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Vikings</a> in which <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wooden.html" title="Wooden">wooden</a> planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks may be mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or with adhesives. Often, steam bent wooden frames are fitted inside the hull. This technique is known as clinker in Britain and also as clench built.</li>
<li>Another method uses sheets of <b><a href="../../../p/l/y/Plywood.html" title="Plywood">plywood panel</a></b>s fixed to a frame. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines. A type of the <b>plywood panel</b> boat building method is known as the <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stitch_and_glue.html" title="Stitch and glue">stitch-and-glue</a> method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic wires pull curved flat panels into three dimensional curved shapes. These hullls generally have one or more chines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel.html" title="Steel">Steel</a> (and before that <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a>) - Either used in sheet for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy. The material rusts unless protected from water. Modern steel components are <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welding.html" title="Welding">welded</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolted_joint.html" title="Bolted joint">bolted</a> together. Until the mid 1900s, steel sheets were <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivet.html" title="Rivet">riveted</a> together.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">Aluminium</a> - either used in sheet for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are made of aluminium. The material requires special manufacturing techniques, construction tools and construction skills. While it is easy to cut, aluminium is difficult to weld, and also requires heat treatments such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precipitation_strengthening.html" title="Precipitation strengthening">precipitation strengthening</a> for most applications. <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrosion.html" title="Corrosion">Corrosion</a> is a concern with aluminium, particularly below the waterline.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiberglass.html" title="Fiberglass">Fiberglass</a> (<a href="../../../g/l/a/Glass-reinforced_plastic.html" title="Glass-reinforced plastic">Glass-reinforced plastic</a> or GRP) - Typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mold as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balsa.html" title="Balsa">balsa</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/a/Foam.html" title="Foam">foam</a> or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mold, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but isn't usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case doesn't provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fiberglass boats are currently made in an open mold, with fiberglass and resin applied by hand. Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibers are laid out and resin is pulled into the mold by admospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Composite_materials.html" title="Composite materials">Composite</a> - While GRP, wood, and even concrete hulls are technically made of composite materials, the term "composite" is often used for plastics reinforced with fibers other than (or in addition to) glass. Cold-molded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. "Cold-molding" is now a relatively archaic term because the contrasting "hot-molded" method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_world_war.html" title="Second world war">WWII</a>. Now almost all curing is done at room temperature. Other composite types include sheathed-strip, which uses (usually) a single layer of strips laid up parallel to the sheer line. The composite materials in question are then applied to the mold in the form of a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermosetting_plastic.html" title="Thermosetting plastic">thermosetting plastic</a> (usually <a href="../../../e/p/o/Epoxy.html" title="Epoxy">epoxy</a>, polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth (<a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiberglass.html" title="Fiberglass">fiberglass</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">kevlar</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynel.html" title="Dynel">dynel</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">carbon fiber</a>, etc), hence the finished hull is a "composite" of fiber and resin. These methods often give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and skills.</li>
<li>Steel-reinforced <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cement.html" title="Cement">cement</a> (ferrocement) - Strong and long lasting. First developed in the mid 19th Century in France. Used for building warships during the war. Extensively refined in New Zealand shipyards in the 1950s and the material became popular among amateur builders of cruising sailboats in the 1970s and 1980s, because the material cost was cheap although the labour time element was high. The weight of a finished ferro-cement boat is comparable to that of a traditionally built wooden boat. As such they are often built for slower, more comfortable sea passages. Hulls built properly of ferrocement are more labor-intensive than steel or fiberglass, so there are few examples of commercial ship-yards using this material. The inability to mass produce boats in ferro cement has led there to being few examples around. Many ferrocement boats built in back yards have a rough, lumpy look, which has helped to give the material a poor reputation. The ferro-cement method is easy to do, but it is also easy to do wrong. This has led to some disastorous 'home-built' boats. Properly designed, built and plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and therefore are often mistaken for wooden or fiberglass boats.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat_building.html" title="Edit section: Hull types">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hull types</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Round bilge hull - As its name implies, the hulls of these vessels are rounded and don't usually have any chines or corners.</li>
<li>Chined hull These are hulls made up of flat panels. The flat panels are commonly made of plywood sheets, but some use more traditional methods of planking. Chined hulls range from flat bottomed boats such as banks dories, sharpies and skiffs, the side and bottom are 2 distinct pieces meeting at a sharp angle known as the chine. Flat bottomed boats are simple to build and shallow in draft. Most are intended for use in protected waters, though the banks dory evolved as a fishing boat in the open Atlantic. There are also many multichine boats that have more than the one chine each side of the flat bottomed boat. This can allow a round bilge hull shape to be approximated.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_%28watercraft%29.html" title="Hull (watercraft)">Displacement hulls</a> - These are hulls which have a shape which does not promote <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planing.html" title="Planing">planing</a>. They travel through the water at a limited rate which is defined by the waterline length. They are often heavier than planing types, though not always.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/l/a/Planing_%28sailing%29.html" title="Planing (sailing)">Planing</a> hulls - These are hulls with a shape that allows the boat to rise higher and higher out of the water as the speed increases. They are sometmes flat bottomed, sometimes vee-bottomed and sometimes round bilged. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow higher speeds to be achieved, and are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. They do require more energy to achieve these speeds.</li>
