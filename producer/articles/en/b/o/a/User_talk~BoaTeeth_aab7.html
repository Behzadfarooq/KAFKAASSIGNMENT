<p>Thanks for uploading Image:BruceHornsby.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>
<p>For more information on using images, see the following pages:</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:BruceFace.jpg</b>. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

<p>I am afraid that you are wrong in assuming that I should help you replace the unfree images you upload. The onus is squarely on your shoulders, not on myself to provide replacements for unfree images that you have uploaded. The source that you have given for the images you uploaded do not state that they are {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-2.0_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cc-by-2.0">cc-by-2.0</a>}}. You have incorrectly tagged them. Also, the source for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Image%7ETreyAnastasio.jpg_215f.html" title="Image:TreyAnastasio.jpg">Image:TreyAnastasio.jpg</a> states that it is licensed under a {{<a href="../../../n/o/n/Template%7ENoncommercial_931a.html" title="Template:Noncommercial">Noncommercial</a>}}, thus the tagging on wikipedia is incorrect, as stated on that image page, and it should also perhaps be deleted. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. I am assuming good faith in that you are unaware of copyright image policy on Wikipedia. Perhaps you should read <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. We cannot just tag images with copyright licenses that are incorrect. If you do not wish your talk page filled with instructions on how to deal with your uploads, perhaps you could correctly tag the images when you upload them. As you are obviously familiar with Flickr, there is a search option with which you could find free images. This is not harrassement, simply, if I see a user uploading a couple of images under incorrect tags, then I check your upload log to see if there are more of the same. A tactic employed by many people here. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 18:04, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The three images that you just uploaded, the album cover requires a source and the two from flickr used the wrong license. They should have been tagged {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-nc-sa-2.0_086d.html" title="Template:Cc-by-nc-sa-2.0">cc-by-nc-sa-2.0</a>}} as they use a <i>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0</i> license. I have retagged them accordingly. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 23:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
