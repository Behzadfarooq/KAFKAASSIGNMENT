<p>My House adviser when I was talking to him once mentioned a term that gave him 'parental authority' over me signed over by my parents (and the parents of all boarders). My memory says that the term was Parental Locus but I can't seem to find it elsewhere on google, is anyone aware of the proper term that I am looking for?</p>
<p>In loco parentis?</p>

<p><i>"These schools take in some students as boarders and other students as semi-boarders, who would only attend school hours in the day alongside boarders and then return to their homes."</i></p>
<p>In what sense are "semi-boarders" boarders? According to this definition they are day pupils, exactly like in a day school.</p>
<p><i>"These schools might also admit some students as day-boarders. These pupils would have meals at school along with attending classes, but they live off-campus."</i></p>
<p>Does this mean that there are people who would have three meals a day on school premises, and then go home? I'm not sure what the point of that would be. If you use this term, it suggests that the definition of "boarder" is someone who takes three meals a day at the school - I always assumed it meant someone who resides at the school for some or all of term time.</p>
<p><i>"On the other hand, quasi-boarders have a different view of boarding schools as compared to most usual boarders (full term boarders), who would only go back to their homes either at the end of a term or by the end of an academic year."</i></p>
<p>As I understand it, this is hopelessly out of date. For the last few decades all schools (at least in Britain) have had half term intervals, and absolutely nobody stays for these. Moreover, there tend to be <i>exeats</i>, which are weekend times at which everyone leaves the campus. When I was there (early-mid 1990s), the only people who "only go back to their homes either at the end of a term or by the end of an academic year" were people from overseas, who had special accommodation arranged for them during exeats and half term.</p>
<p>There's also no direct mention of the <i>weekly boarder</i> (stay for the week and go home at weekends), which is the sort I was - I guess this is a kind of quasi-boarder?</p>

<p>I attended a Boarding school in the US, and we had Day students. The Day students attended the school and were in fact the majority of those attending. Of a population of 800 or so students in the pre-college school (highschool) only 160 lived in the dormitories.</p>
<p>The day students would eat lunch at the school as part of their tuition fees, and if they were not a boarder they could attend breakfast or dinner meals (or both) by paying a small fee of $5.00USD for the meal (Or charging it to their student account).</p>
<p>These day students are just that, day students. Boarders participate in dormitory activities and live in the dorms as well as must abide by curfews and other restrictions whereby any leaving campus must be notified to their dormitory office, etc. Day Students when on campus and not during school hours are responsible to them selves and their parents and are rarely found on campus on the weekends accept perhaps for club or sport activities.</p>

<p>This article might seem out of date when selectively compared to some experimental schools and elite prep schools.

<dd>I never got the impression that the school I went to was either experimental, elite or prep. Moreover, who here goes/went to a school where people stay for the half term break?

<dd>Even if in many countries half term breaks still don't exist, it's misleading considering the extent to which the article appears to have been written from a British viewpoint.

<hr />
<p>I agree that this article seems to have little to do with the, I think fairly typical, boarding school that I attended from 1995-2000. The first two paragraphs under "Boarding School Description" seem to have been written from a very odd viewpoint (why is it so important to list the various rooms, and what school has a "storehouse" for personal belongings?) and the minute cataloguing of different types of boarders is simply incorrect in relation to any school I know.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="A_General_description_of_Boarding_schools" id="A_General_description_of_Boarding_schools"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/a/Talk%7EBoarding_school_e982.html" title="Edit section: A General description of Boarding schools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A General description of Boarding schools</span></h2>
<p>An encyclopedia article has to cater to diverse readers. For those who have been to boarding schools this article might seem vague or even odd with all the details or the rooms and the various "types of boarders". But if one was to talk to people who have never seen/been to boarding schools, then the basic information they ask are those that might be considered mundane. Like different boarding schools and different systems and functioning, different schedules of going back to ones homes eg: pupils who visit homes every weekend; those on the other hand who return home at the end of a semester or term, etc....</p>
<p>Considering that many people have not been/seen a boarding school, traditional or newer ones, mundane and seemingly redundant information like "storehouse" and "bunk beds" is important detail.</p>
<p>While writing an article for an encyclopedia, one has to be general, especially considering an international readership. Writing a general or "universal" article about education systems or the like is an imperfect task, where variations are diverse. And most often the best option is to detail the mundane information, the traditional aspects, and from a general perspective and in this case a very broad perspective across developed and developing countries. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_klein_03ef.html" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 04:50, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, can I make a different point and say that to my reading the first few paragraphs of this article take a somewhat negative view of the subject. I'm not arguing facts, but tone. Particularly,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>...<i>as defined by the boarding school administrators. These activities have a predefined structure and time set by the institution. These predefined schedules and norms are to be strictly followed, the failure of which could earn punishment.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>, the suggestion in the following paragraph that boarding schools damage children in some way, and the sinister-sounding "total institution" in the very first sentence. These combine to give a negative, rather than a neutral, view of the subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a separate point, I also agree with smjg that the categorisation of "boarders", "semi-boarders", "quasi-boarders" and "full-term boarders" is confusing, apparently contradictory, and in many cases factually wrong. I would prefer to replace them with the self-explanatory terms (in order of increasing time spent at school) <b>day-pupil</b>¹, <b>weekly boarder</b>, <b>full boarder</b>, while noting that this terminology does not necessarily apply all over the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>¹ Noting that the rather more euphonious <b>day-boy</b> is invariably used in single-sex boys' schools.</dd>

<dd>You say that "Day boy" is common in American English. I'll take your word for that; I'm not qualified to judge. I'm British, went to a British boarding school, and have a number of friends who went to (different) British boarding schools. The terms "Day scholar" and "Day boarder" which you assert are common in British English are unfamiliar to me. "Day scholar" I can see could arise as a legitimate gender-neutral version of "Day boy", but "Day boarder" is contradictory. A day-[boy|pupil|scholar] is the opposite to a boarder. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteVerdon_aca4.html" title="User:PeteVerdon">PeteVerdon</a> 12:17, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At my (British, single-sex) school, the terms were "day boy", "weekly boarder" and "full boarder" (a quarter of a term at a time). I agree that self-explanatory terms should be used wherever possible. But to what extent can "full boarder" be considered self-explanatory? I guess we can suppose it means the maximum level of boarding that the school provides.... -- <a href="../../../s/m/j/User%7ESmjg_a789.html" title="User:Smjg">Smjg</a> 16:13, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Likewise, except that full-boarders were for half a term at a time, as (apart from the Junior school) we did not have exeats. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteVerdon_aca4.html" title="User:PeteVerdon">PeteVerdon</a> 19:05, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is sorry that the term "Total institution" sounds sinister. However it is the term used for these institutions by social scientists in social sciences literature, eg: Psychology, sociology, anthropology etc. So it is definitely neutral or NPOV.</p>
<p>However, the term Total Institution is not all that sinister it has 14,500 hits on the google <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_klein_03ef.html" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 15:21, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Goffman's definition in Wikipaedia, none of the paradigm boarding schools are Total Institutions: "an institution where all the aspects of life of individuals under the institution is controlled and regulated by the authorities of the organization. Total institutions are a social microcosmos dictated by hegemony and clear hierarchy. Total institutions include some boarding schools...."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This sociology is admittedly not applicable to boarding schools generally, the subject is of minority interest, and at the least contentious applicability and value (you may as well define a family as a Total Institution). This academic terminology is obscure to many readers of this encyclopaedia; and it clearly does not follow from what the author says above that it is NPOV. It sounds as though he knows little of the schools he is claiming to classify. (You can read in law reports and royal pardons how "controlled and regulated" my boarding school in central London has been!) Google will return hundreds of hits for obvious spelling mistakes, so that is hardly a measure of proper usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, this terminology is utterly inappropriate to the first line of a definition of a common phrase. <a href="../../../j/e/z/User%7EJezzabr_f3fe.html" title="User:Jezzabr">Jezzabr</a> 17:22, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the use of boarding schools as an attack upon indigenous cultures is a very important issue that may need more coverage from a historical perspective in this article (is this still happening?). At the same time, this article has an overall atmosphere of "modernity" that puts an excessive emphasis on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_theory.html" title="Social theory">social theory</a> without any real <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_wars.html" title="Science wars">scientific basis</a>. In particular I take issue with the supposed benefits of prolonging childhood by keeping children within the family structure past adolescence. Is there any evidence, aside from the very factual dominance of the ruling classes, for the positive or negative effects of boarding schools? Any social practice can be done well or poorly. Since all issues associated with human society are highly complex, we must strive much harder not to make statements that are more <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashionable.html" title="Fashionable">fashionable</a> than <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">factual</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking as a father whose children did not go to preparatory boarding schools, I think that we need to recognize that many boys and/or girls need a broader perspective than their (often disrespected) families can provide as they reach the fledgling stages of adolescence. There is a very deep and well documented history of this kind of cultural education, from the extended initiations of the australian aborigines (and other indigenous peoples) to the upper class boarding schools of the British. The main reason that my children did not go to boarding schools was expense, and it needs to be noted in this article that - mostly - boarding schools are the prerogative of the well-to-do.</p>
<p>Coming of age is a very difficult period in all times and in all places for people. Getting away from the idiosyncracies of any particular (amateur) family is one way of facilitating the process. I am writing this on the "talk" page because I am not prepared to do the research and find the citations to improve this article myself. Instead, I may take the lazier approach of asking for citations with every questionable assertion.<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunning_3955.html" title="User:Dunning">Bob</a> 00:24, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
