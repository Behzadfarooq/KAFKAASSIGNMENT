<dd>I would say it passes according to the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a>, though I accept they're neither terribly precise nor gospel. It's certainly "A forum with more than 5,000 users" and it has "a verifiable impact beyond its own user community"—board game retailers and manufacturers link to it because it's the most authoritative and comprehensive English-language site on the subject—so it satisfies criterion 2. And its Alexa rank was 10947 when I looked, so it's damn close to satisfying criterion 3 as well.</dd>
<dd>And I'm curious what your notion of "blatant plug" is.

<dd>For boardgamers, it's THE website. It's an encyclopedic database of every board game ever published, and so this entry seems like a very good idea. It's already been debated by the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia%7ECounter_Vandalism_Unit_5ae9.html" title="Wikipedia:Counter Vandalism Unit">Wikipedia:Counter Vandalism Unit</a> here: <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia_talk%7ECounter_Vandalism_Unit_Archive_3_8162.html#HELP.21" title="Wikipedia talk:Counter Vandalism Unit/Archive 3">Wikipedia_talk:Counter_Vandalism_Unit/Archive_3#HELP!</a>, and they deemed it worthy of inclusion on other pages.

<dd>I must agree that it is not a valid Wikipedia entry, and is more advertising a website than anything else. No-one really wants to find any information on BoardGameGeek, as it is just another website.

<p>Richard, have you looked at all of the Wikipedia coverage that has been given to other websites, not to mention the tremendous amount of content here is that is devoted to anime? It's generally presumptuous to claim that any given article doesn't <i>deserve</i> to be on Wikipedia. That "no one wants to find information on BoardGameGeek" is not for you or I to judge. In fact, I wonder how you came to this discussion page if you had no curiosity on the topic. No one is suggesting that we list every web page in existence, but certainly a site that defines a particular hobby and involves thousands of users is worthy of an entry here. And if we are going to eliminate entries that might serve as advertising, BoardGameGeek pales in comparison to many, many organizations and companies that should and do have entries here. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 18:29, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's more than fair to list the top 5 or 10 games according to BGG. I know it's simple (and arguably more accurate) to just link to said rankings, but to give the article a little bit more practical information (and interest to read), I think it's a safe add. It's no more wasteful than listing every Emmy or Oscar nomination and win for every category and every year. 66.190.223.36 22:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)Sean</p>

<dd>I think the including the rankings is wrong. The article should be about the site itself. If people want to know the latest rankings they can go to the site. I would take it out but I have the feeling that someone would put it right back, besides it doesn't hurt anyone. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 01:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should this page have a criticism section? There are two issues I can think of: Sexism: Male BoardGameGeek users are often accused of being overly giddy over cleavage and general images posted that involve females, at one point even angering one of the subjects of these photos to the point of almost leaving the site. Bias: Many users of BoardGameGeek are biased against party games, and will often take points away from such games just because of their genre, often not even wanting to admit that they may have liked one. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobadot_bb41.html" title="User:Bobadot">Bobadot</a> 23:51, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is a more than acceptable addition if you's like. However, I'd encourage you to find BGG forum debates, or some other citation. Otherwise, it will appear like some bitter/vengeful person. Which I'm sure you aren't. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheprosperonight_2b7f.html" title="User:Theprosperonight">Theprosperonight</a> 03:50, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would say that boardgamegeek users are no more <i>sexist</i> than society as a whole, and so your criticism seems a bit selective and unfair to me. Should we remove the entry for football because some of the fans are sexist? And as for <i>bias</i>, most party games have limited replay value and therefore compare unfavorably to more serious hobby games like Puerto Rico or Tigris and Euphrates (that said, I happen to enjoy such party games as Apples to Apples and Taboo, but I wouldn't rate them over a 7 or so). A more relevant point might be that BGG is biased in favor of adult games over children's games, but so what? This hardly makes for a bane upon society.<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 23:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps the criticism about the low status of party games should be included in the community section or the introduction. It would make it clear the average Joe's idea of a board game is none too popular on the site. I know the low status of Life and Monopoloy shocks a lot of my friends.<a href="../../../g/i/t/User%7EGittes_ee52.html" title="User:Gittes">Gittes</a> 09:48, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the addition of a war game top ten list would add more to the page. Plus The Burning Blue is no longer the number one rated game so if wanted I'll maintain the wargame section of the article.<a href="../../../g/i/t/User%7EGittes_ee52.html" title="User:Gittes">Gittes</a> 09:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly... but there are a couple of issues. The wargame list is highly volatile and therefore always changing. Are you willing to update it on a weekly basis? Also, because of the volatility of the list, the rankings are not as statistically reliable or useful as the overall game rankings. We don't want to mislead people into thinking that Burning Blue is the best wargame, when in fact it is (or was) simply the latest title to rotate to the top. I would recommend against a list of top wargames until there is some stability in these ratings. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 15:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took out the list of rankings, mainly because this is too much information for a WP article. If people want to know they should go to the site itself. This would be better for everyone, IMO. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 21:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>oppose</b> this move. The rankings were highly informative and in fact, one of the central aspects of BoardGameGeek. I don't think they were too much information at all for a WP entry, and they certainly do not take up much space. The ranking section seems rather empty and pointless without the list. --<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 21:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hmmm....IMO, an encyclopedia article should give the reader some basic information about its subject. But it should not make the reader feel that he or she now knows everything about it. It should leave him or her wanting to know more, in this case by visiting the site itself. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 00:28, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK... well, you are certainly entitled to your opinion, and "appropriate level of information" is a highly subjective issue. Nevertheless, it's not like the article was at risk of becoming overly long and complex. Furthermore, I'm not sure how removing the ratings is "better for everyone" as you suggest. Why am I better off not knowing the top rankings?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I noticed that the WP entry for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> contains the table itself and all the elements on it. By your reasoning, should we just explain the concept of a table and have people look up the elements elsewhere? --<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 04:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although BoardGameGeek is cool and should have a WP article, it is quite a few orders of magnitude less important than the periodic table. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 16:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shouldn't the article be about BoardGameGeek, not about games listed on BoardGameGeek? I support removing rankings. Rankings change. Also, there are various rankings, best board games, best card games, best party games, etc etc. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBeale_725e.html" title="User:DanBeale">DanBeale</a> 10:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's necessary or desirable to have an up-to-the-minute list of the top 10 rated games, but removing them entirely goes too far the other way. Listing several of the games that are consistently top rated would give the reader an idea of the types of games that are favored on the web site (i.e. not <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly</a>). <a href="../../../j/w/o/User%7EJwolfe_9fa5.html" title="User:Jwolfe">Jwolfe</a> 17:06, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is weird. It's been nearly a month since anyone has removed content or attempted to get this page deleted... I'm not sure a consensus was ever reached, but I guess I've gotten used to the rankings being removed. We should do something about beefing up that section of the entry though, as it is an important feature of BGG. --<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 17:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
