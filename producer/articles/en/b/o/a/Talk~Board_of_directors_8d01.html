<p>I am wondering if anyone can provide example job descriptions for a chairman of the board? What are their duties and responsibilities?</p>
<p><br />
I was hoping to find an explanation of the difference between an "executive director" and a "non-executive director"! Would someone with expertise in this topic please add this info? Thanks.</p>
<p>An executive director plays an active part in running the company, non-executive directors only offer advice.</p>

<p>Seems to me that this definition is only half a loaf. Non-profit corporations also have Boards of Directors. They do not have shareholders; they have members. Some of the principles of corporate governance are the same. But I think there are some important distinctions. Where a corporation has shareholders, it seems to me that the essential element of trust is fiduciary. Simply put, the Directors are mainly there to ensure that the money is handled responsibly and profits are distributed equitably. Naturally directors of a non-profit will have a similar role in ensuring that corporate money is handled responsibility. But there is no distribution of profits. Seems to me that directors of a for-profit corporation will be oriented towards a goal of maximizing profit while directors of a non-profit corporation will be oriented towards a goal of maximizing the influence of the corporation in its chosen field. Does this make a difference in defining the role of a director? Would appreciate some sage comment on this question. Bud Jorgensen &lt;sweep@TourduCanada.com&gt;</p>

<p>There is so little on <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Trustees_285c.html" title="Board of Trustees">Board of Trustees</a>, the two should be merged together. the opening of this article states that A Board of Directors is <i>also known as</i> a board of trustees. - <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbowtie_145b.html" title="User:Mrbowtie">Mrbowtie</a> 21:08, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me follow up to myself, here. A Board of Directors and a Board of Trustees are legally two different things with different powers and responsibilities. It is not unusual for a corporation, typically non-profits, to misname a BoD as BoT, but this should merely be acknowledged in the article. It should not be encouraged with a bad encyclopedia article. -<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardjp_053d.html" title="User:Howardjp">James Howard</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowardjp_214f.html" title="User talk:Howardjp">talk</a>/<a href="http://jameshoward.us/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="jameshoward:Main_Page">web</a>) 01:56, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do not merge whilst the terms may be interchanged in casual use they have very different definitions some of which, in the UK at least, are formalised though legislation<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bertiet (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bertiet_0020.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bertiet">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Don't merge. They are legally entirely separate concepts, and regulated in completely different ways.

<p>I am curious as to how the current system and set up with respct to Boards of directors came to be. The fact that in many (most?) cases the board of directors are not employees (or even stock holders) of the company supprised me the firt time I heard it, and I came to this article hoping to find a bit of history on it. I suspect that the <i>See also</i> link to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_governance.html" title="Corporate governance">Corporate governance</a> might cover this though for completions sake a at least SOME history shouldbe included here with a contextual link to the other article.

<dd>It comes from the fact that a Corporation is essentially a trust. Trusts have trustees that oversee the corpus for the beneficiaries' sake.

<dd>In the US most states' incorporation laws state that there must be at least three directors, unless there are less than three shareholders and then all shareholders must also be directors.

<p>Could the first "definition" of this article be expanded? I came here to find out who the board of directories is comprised of, in general, for corporations, but it has no information on this. Is it comprised of the largest/large shareholders, generally? Or, as my roommate suggests, is it non-shareholders who are suppose to provide independent oversight?</p>

<p>This article does not tell about the laws that require boards of directors, typical officers on a board, typical educations, experiences, contacts, etc. of board members. There is also nothing about the history of the concept of boards of directors. Almost the entire article is devoted to pointing out the alleged shortcomings of boards, and none of the statements have sources to verify them.

<p>I know someone that has started up a non profit corporation and in the Incorporation Papers they are listed as the Directors of this Incorporation. Also in the Incorporation papers it said that they too are the four Officers required to have an Incorporation until such time a new group of Officers are appointed. Since the Incorporation there has been a new oppointment of three Officers of V.P., Secretary, and Treasure. The Presidents position still remains one of the Board of Directors. Also the Incorporation has also become a 501 C 3 Non Profit Public Charitiy. If for some reason the Position of the four Officers were not always occuipied what would happen in ways of the Incorporation? Could the President which is also the Board of Directors take over the dailey operations and continue to run things until such a time of reappointment of the Officers? Such as paying bills, etc.? What will happen to the Incorporation? 162.40.224.129 23:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
