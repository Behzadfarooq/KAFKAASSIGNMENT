<p>I have removed the following passage from the article to the talk page as it seems to be a personal opinion of the editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the film <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love%21_Valour%21_Compassion%21_34f6.html" title="Love! Valour! Compassion!">Love! Valour! Compassion!</a> a group of gay men are reading a book and laughing about the improbable people the book outs as "gay". This is likely an discreet commentary on Hadleigh's books.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several books by other authors dealing with homosexual celebrities. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 10:38, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I put in a dispute notice on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A linguist with the ability to converse in five languages, Hadleigh has an M.A. in journalism and has traveled to 48 countries. He has been called the "<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Pepys_035c.html" title="Samuel Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>".

<p>The review of Hadleigh's <i>Conversations With My Elders</i> published by <i>Midwest Book Review</i> should not be removed from the article page. Established in 1976, the <i>Midwest Book Review</i> publishes several monthly publications for community and academic library systems in California, Wisconsin, and the upper Midwest. It is an organization of volunteers committed to promoting literacy, library usage, and giving priority consideration to small press publishers, self-published authors, and academic presses. They accept no financial donations from authors or publishers for their services. It is certainly a reliable source. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 01:10, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Midwest Book Reviews are written by <b>volunteers</b> whose credentials are not made public and <b>they do not provide <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_criticism.html" title="Literary criticism">Literary criticism</a></b>. Literary magazines do not quote Midwest Reviews. They specialze in small press or self-published authors who can't get a review by the authorative professional sources. Major publishing houses do not submit their books to Midwest, but a "volunteer" reviewer who likes a book can review any book on the market they please. As such, Hadleigh's book was reviewed by an unknown volunteer. Since Jim cox made a financial arrangement a few years ago with Gale Research Company, Midwest no longer charges for a book review. However, in 1987 when Hadleigh's book was published, they did charge. It is a good idea to know what you are talking about in an encyclopedia - not a quick cut-and-paste of selected information from the Internet to suit a purpose. - <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">Ted Wilkes</a> 16:32, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, Ted. I didn't know that there is such an Amazon source. So the year of Hadleigh's birth may be included. However, is the source reliable? Who has provided the alleged year of birth? According to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_Journal_05f8.html" title="Library Journal">Library Journal</a>, Hadleigh had been an "entertainment journalist since the 1960s" who "conducted volumes of off-the-record interviews with celebrities reputed to be gay or bisexual..." If it is true that he already worked as a journalist during the 60s, he cannot be born in 1954. Thus, it is more likely that he has been born in 1934. It could well be that the entry from <i>Contemporary Authors</i> is a misprint. Further, I am not satisfied with Ted Wilkes's latest edits. They seem to be personal research. I have now removed some passages, as the year of Hadleigh's birth is still uncertain (two sources contradict each other) and the claims included by Wilkes were based on the fact that Hadleigh was actually born in 1954. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 16:44, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Interesting: Onefortyone please tell us what the digital reference volume published by Thomson Gale, says about Hadleigh's education? - 16:44, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well done, Ted. You may be astonished, but I am accepting your line of reasoning. Hadleigh's own account of his first meeting with actor <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sal_Mineo_9172.html" title="Sal Mineo">Sal Mineo</a> in his book, <i>Conversations with my Elders</i>, certainly supports the view that he was born in 1954. However, I am still of the opinion that your text partly includes some personal research and interpretation. Therefore, I have now revised and tightened up the text in order to make it more neutral. I hope this is satisfactory to all. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 18:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section on "Questions regarding the authenticity of his writings" challenges his work primarily based on his age, as if being young somehow invalidates what he says. In fact, the interviewees frequently comment on his youth, and show surprise that someone so young should know so much about film and Hollywood history. I read the entire entry as editorially biased against Mr. Hadleigh, with the only "evidence" offered being the above challenge based solely on his age at the time of some of the interviews. The entire entry should be rewritten in a less biased form, with the controversy over the authenticity of some of the interviews relegated to a section that deals with specific charges that are based on verifiable information.</p>
