<p>Thank you for your willingness to actually try to help. I do appreciate it. If the article is left locked until, as one admin said, Oliver and we "agree", if will remain locked forever. Oliver has no incentive to negotiate or change the article, since the article is exactly as he liked it. The only ones who seem interested in participating are Oliver, and those of us whom Oliver claims are political (as opposed to himself). Still, in the interest of AGF (Is that the TLA - three letter acronym?), I did as you suggested and proposed a section - on rupture. Every statement in this proposed material is true and accurate - eg not slanted or inaccurate for failure to omit an important fact. I do not care for that type of inaccuracy, regardless of one's views on this or any other issue. It is intellectually dishonest.</p>
<p>I also do not think that every single point or study (positive or negative) should be belabored. Oliver raised the two studies that report the least percentage of rupture. Those are the ones I left, with no other studies (that do exist and arguably are as accurate as the ones he claims are 'random'). It is not randam when one deliberately excludes implants removed because of rupture, when considering the prevalence of rupture (amazing!). The authors of that study acknowledge that they underrepresents rupture, as a result, but do not include this in the conclusion, or report how many ruptured implants were excluded. Anyway, other studies suggest rupture prevalance rate is much much higher than either of these two studies. I have omitted mention of them entirely. And, there are no studies that examine rupture rate in implants older than 10 years. Please take a look. And I hope you are not the only one who will participate.Jance 00:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC) <a name="G_Patrick_Maxwell--_Fluff_piece_is_back" id="G_Patrick_Maxwell--_Fluff_piece_is_back"></a></p>

<p>Would you take a look at this article again, please? Some of the complaints re WP:Peacock seem to be re-added by Droliver. This was his teacher, and he wrote the article as an accolade, and seems intent on recreating it. For example, as a citation for Maxwell's becoming 'known as the first...' he used a commercial product catalog. A couple of other references are non-existent. He bolded "Best Doctors in America" as an award, which is not a very credible award (rather like the "whos who of college students and the like). I admit to being biased re Oliver, as I find him detestable. Therefore, I won't revert, but I'd appreciate some outside input.Jance 06:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback to the NoFollow discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html#rel.3Dnofollow_WE_NEED_THIS" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">WikipediaProject Spam</a>. I also read the long post at <a href="../../../p/a/s/User_talk%7EPascal.Tesson_Archive_4_dd6a.html#Nofollow" title="User talk:Pascal.Tesson/Archive 4">Pascal's Talk Page Archive</a>. I can completely relate to the problem of getting tired of repeating the same stuff over and over again. Because of that reason did I move discussions with relevant content to the topic to a consolidated place on my website <a href="http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/scraps/20060417_What_is_Googles_Rel_No_Follow.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/scraps/20060417_What_is_Googles_Rel_No_Follow.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I did that, because I saw in the year I am a wikipedian more than one discussion disappear from the Wiki (including history). You can't add comments there which is not so good. I need to reinstall the Mediawiki again on that server one day.</p>
<p>I see your point of the discussion and why you don't want it enabled in the article space and make it a choice for the user pages, however I see also some flaws in it. I think that a link in an article MUST be first and foremost be relevant to the article and add value to it. For whom? The human visitor that is reading the article. Search Engines are secondary. I will come back to that one a bit later. I also think that internal links should have a nofollow attribute as well, except internal links from one article to another. The effect if some external links have the attribute and some don't would reduce the effectiveness of the attribute considerably. If the rule is general with no exception, also the spammer in the furthest region on the planet will learn about it. It would be big news and send out a message that is today only a whisper. "PageRank is dead". The original principle is becoming less and less of a factor for the major search engines because of massive abuse. MSN has the least developed algo's and is the most susceptible to attacks of the big 3. It was <a href="http://www.revenews.com/wayneporter/archives/002069.html" class="external text" title="http://www.revenews.com/wayneporter/archives/002069.html" rel="nofollow">"nicely" demonstrated this summer</a>.</p>
<p>But even Google and Yahoo have problems with this which are still not solved effectively. The SE's know that and the only tactic they have today is to scare people to death to reduce the problem that way as much as they can to buy themselves time to actually come up with a solution. Don't buy links, don't exchange links, don't cross link sites you own, add nofollow etc. They could have said: Either don't add or at least flag any link that you would not protect with your life or at least not "co-sign" for, because we do a bad job in determining intend and relevance of links at the moment. We work on it, but in the meantime please help us to suck less. Okay, let us help them and add nofollow to any link that is not to somebody I would trust with my life. Let that become standard practice and Google will become able to calculate PageRank in real-time, because there will not be much to calculate anymore. May be that would cause the SE to increase their efforts to come up with a solution that works better. Until then will Spammers care about links nobody sees, even if only 1 in thousand creates results. If the result is $0.0000000 after a week of work, nobody would SPAM in that fashion, unless it is for research purposes.</p>
<p>Spammers need then to shift their focus ENTIRELY to areas where it is seen by a human at least one of them and there must be at least a remote chance that this human will act on it a way that benefits the spammer. If you spam a site with a 100% readership of strong believing Muslims and offer delicious pork chops, your conversion will be 0, regardless if you spam once or a billion times. The same results would have adult entertainment merchandise which involves young and pretty women with little or no clothes when promoted to an audience of 100% catholic priests. The more it becomes targeted, the less it becomes SPAM actually. SPAM that actually benefits me is not really annoying and I will be forgiving the fact that I did not ask for it. The more the spam moves to the visible space the more relevant does it need to become or the easier it is to detect automatically without a human even seeing it. The latest Blog Spam plug-ins are a very good proof for this. Also "learning" Email Spam filters work extremely efficient and over time almost 100% accurate. It is obviously currently not feasible or possible for the major search engines to use the same principles to solve the spam problem. If it is relevant, the spam filter will not catch it, but it also is not really spam anymore. I removed dozens of external links just because they were not discussed (what we made a principle for some of the heavily spammed articles with an active editor community), good links to highly relevant sites which I found out about, only because of the "spam". I would have left some in the articles but know that this is of no use, because the link will be removed by somebody who does not care about the article itself because of one or more Wikipedia principles that were violated. Some of those principles and guidelines are factoring in PageRank etc. as motivation. It seems to become sometimes the simplest excuse why a link was removed from an article. You avoid spending time justifying the removal.</p>
<p>Another important thing you need to consider in all this, is the fact that search engines today do not treat Wiki Name-spaces differently (unless told so via Meta Tags or Robots.txt). User Name-space or Article Name-space are equal in the eyes of SE's. They can as much benefit the site as they can harm it at the same time. Editors are busy enough to watch the article space. They should not need to have to check other areas for developments of damaging linking schema's that have the potential to harm Wikipedia in one way or another, automated penalties or issues with stuff showing up in Search Results or related results. In the latter case is Wikipedia to a certain extend liable. It will be hard to find content of that nature if it is not included in the search results at all. It must be linked to from a visible and busy place to be seen.</p>
<p>If the spam must become more relevant and closer to good content it must become less spam in nature. It is today already possible to detect spam that is too much off topic. Filters could be developed and be very efficient that work on the principles of existing blog comment/trackback spam filters and email spam filters and remove obvious spam automatically. Those filters could be developed already and they would also help under the current situation btw. If stuff remains in the Wiki after all that, the validation of the provided content will happen on a very different premise than today. It would become a very healthy process in my opinion and probably increase the popularity of wikipedia. The good thing is that it is realistic to get there for Wikipedia today. Search Engines are trying to get there. I am absolutely convinced about that. They don't have a practical solution for it yet, but why should we make their life easier that they have to work less hard on the solution for them?</p>
<p>All this sounds nice, I know. My problem is, that I can not find any data about the extend of the issue, the current methods against it and their effectiveness. We can speculate all day long and probably not come to an agreement if we don't know the numbers to make speculations about the impact of a solution and also re-evaluate solutions that are implemented, if they are as effective as they promised to be or not.</p>
<p>I try to learn and find out more about detection and handling of Link Spam at Wikipedias and also try to find Wikipedia SPAM related statistical data. You have much more experience and are also more involved in things here at Wikipedia that you might be able to point me into some directions or even have some information yourself which you might be willing to share with me.</p>
<p>At the end of the day do we have the same goals. We just have to find and verify the right way to get there and make adjustments if we detect that we got a bit of track or the road a bit too bumpy to better check for a detour.</p>
<p>It got pretty late, but hope that all this still makes sense&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 11:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi BozMo,</p>
<p>Nice meeting you. I am also interested in math. I can see you are a Christian. Can you please take care of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a> article. I really feel it is biased against Christianity. For example, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Golshani#Christianity_and_the_Development_of_Modern_Science" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Golshani#Christianity_and_the_Development_of_Modern_Science" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>Criticism of Christian Ethics section should at least state how Christian Ethics improved the ethics of humanity.

<p>What I mean here is that an objective person (someone without biases) attempting to learn about Islam with an open mind would come to the conclusion that Muhammad was a bad man and Islam is false. Similarly, some of the people Muhammad killed were good people who just didn't agree with him. The teenaged boys of the last Jewish tribe he destroyed, for example, didn't do anything wrong, but in Muslim thought they were damned. That doesn't make sense. A perfect God would not damn someone like that. I'll be away for a few hours but will be able to respond later. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 14:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The concept is even stronger in evangelical Christianity, where anyone who doesn't say their formula goes to Hell. In Islam if you, with a certain degree of knowledge, reject Islam then you're damned. That just doesn't make sense because an objective person would reject Islam (though, of course, many people wouldn't). That's what my userpage was saying. God wouldn't damn a fair, open-minded person who approached "his" religion with an open mind. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 14:44, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BozMo. Just wanted to quickly let you know that a large number of editors consider it bad form to respond to the oppose votes in the RFA itself. If I were you I'd either contact the editors directly on their talk pages or take your discussion to the RFA talk page.

<p>I think that humans are very complicated, and their religious beliefs are influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are out of their control. So the idea that someone will go to hell for having the wrong belief conflicts with the idea of a perfect God. On the theoretical level my problems with fundamentalist Christianity are the same as with (necessarily fundamenalist) Islam. The reason I don't really care about Christianity is that I don't see Christians hijacking planes and blowing up buildings in the name of Christianity. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The anti-Sikh thing in India has died down. I encourage you to learn about Islam for yourself. Muslims are encouraged to wage jihad, i.e. fight. I think what says it all is that you don't see Palestinian Christians performing suicide bombings in Israel. You don't know this but the Kashmiri Muslims kicked out 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus, almost all of them, from Kashmir in 1990, and they're still living in refugee camps elsewhere in India. You see this kind of thing all over Islam's borders with the rest of the world. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 09:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the main schools of thought on Islam were set in place a while ago. The writings of midieval scholars are still thought to be authoritative. Basically there are a few equivalent of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> in Islam that are still looked to as giving the correct explanation and interpretation. They have the Quran and books about Muhammad's life and sayings called <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> that they believe are authoritative, and then the key to understanding a verse in the Quran is to see when it was delivered by Muhammad, i.e. what was going on in his life, and for that they use the hadith. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 11:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is written according to a Salafi point of view, but that of course doesn't make their arguments less valid. As for your friend(s) that argue that Jihad isn't about fighting "infidels", I find that rather strange. Almost every single trustworthy hadith that exist, speaks about jihad in the context of fighting.

You mention that you are happy to ignore some of the cruel things that can be found in Leviticus. I am not too familiar with the details of the Christian religion, but it is my understanding that the Christians has actually never wanted to apply these things to their society, and that Jesus clearly rejected having any secular political power, right from his meeting with Satan in the desert? -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 20:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello BozMo,</p>
<p>First I'd like to say sorry for long delay of response. Actually this is my first note to any widipedia editor. I worked more at dmoz.org. Let me introduce myself first. I'm working as a System Administrator of an ISP and love to be involve with voluntery activities [within my limitations], I once worked as a professional webmaster when very few sites were from Bangladesh. This is the reason of my interest, specially if sites are related to Bangladesh.</p>
<p>I've seen the post from Nposs, I'll write him too. I admit that I did not go through in details of WP:External links and Wikipedia:Spam. I will soon. I was the consultant of Online Banglapedia who made it possible to free the encyclopedia [project of Tk. 50m, 7 years] for the Internet community after 8 months of effort to convince the copyright owner and hours of discussion and demonstration, 5 times meeting with the board of editors in year 2003. I served voluntarily. So yes I've link to Banglapedia and all of it's mirror sites. I'm not yet aware of if it prohibits me from editing. I'll check the wikipedia policies. But <a href="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd" class="external free" title="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd" rel="nofollow">http://banglapedia.search.com.bd</a> is the oldest, authorized, frequently maintained and most important the maximum availability among the other sites though they have ads. You may check <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd</a> even the beginning of the article have link to that site. Yes, I'll mind the ads issue as you've told. Please don't hesitate to write a mail for more discussion. I'm not sure if we can continue here as forum discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks. zbd 16:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me. You will find the first presence of the contents of the encyclopedia at archive.org on Apr 06, 2004 [ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040406225728/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040406225728/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20040406225728/http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/</a> ]. If you take a look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403171219/http://www.banglapedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403171219/http://www.banglapedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20050403171219/http://www.banglapedia.org/</a> you'll see banglapedia.org is even parked at banglapedia.search.com.bd. Even the starting [05:58, 31 March 2005] of this article by an individual contains <a href="http://banglapedia.search.cm.bd" class="external free" title="http://banglapedia.search.cm.bd" rel="nofollow">http://banglapedia.search.cm.bd</a> at wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banglapedia&amp;oldid=11713469" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banglapedia&amp;oldid=11713469" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banglapedia&amp;oldid=11713469</a>.</p>
<p>Here is little more of the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Domain Name: banglapedia.net Created On: 18-jan-2005 Content of Encyclopedia came on: Dec 31, 2005</i></li>
<li><i>Domain Name: banglapedia.org Created On:27-Jan-2003 Content of Encyclopedia came on: Apr 03, 2005</i></li>
<li><i>banglapedia.search.com.bd Content of Encyclopedia came on: Apr 06, 2004 [Experimental Hosting Mach, 2003 to convince the publisher]</i></li>
<li><i>banglapedia.net was registered and under control by individual until 2005 when registered again.</i></li>
<li><i>banglapedia.org were registered and under control by individual until 2003 when registered again.Even banglapedia.org was hijack after that and had to buy again in 2005.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>All happened because of unawareness about the Internet &amp; technical issues by the concerned authority. How do I know all these? Because I wanted to free the encyclopedia for Internet community. I considered the stability and of the sites preference among them with my own set of parameters. Anyway, please do what you find correct and better for wikipedia.org.

<p>Hi BozMo,</p>
<p>Criticisms of X articles, I think, should also include a response section. I am not sure but Arrow is probably refering to this section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Qur%27an#War_and_violence" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Qur%27an#War_and_violence" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> arguing that the quote of Patricia Crone should be excluded. Please note the size of the criticism section and response section. Even if we include the Crone's material, the criticism section will take 2.5 times more space than the response section. As you can see from the responses section<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Qur%27an#Responses" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Qur%27an#Responses" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, the response to critics is that they self-interpret the Islamic literature, take verses out of their contexts, and then criticize it. For example, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a> asserts that the scholarship and interpretations of the critic, Robert Spencer, are fundamentally flawed. The quote from Crone presents a short summary of an academic view of Qur'an with respect to warfare contrasting the academic view with Critic's view. I would be more than happy to see your comments on that. Cheers, --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I have been thinking about this one overnight. You made a similar point about the Criticism of Christianity Article being imbalanced as well. Part of the problem is that the word "criticism" is ambiguous: often it means assessment (as in theatre critic, source criticism) often it means negative assessment. There is also a difficult issue about the notability of the criticism versus the notability of the subject (e.g. in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Religion_6f56.html" title="Criticism of Religion">Criticism_of_Religion</a> quite a lot of the reasons for not being religious seem to me to be true (a lot of people give them) but not perhaps notable as reasons (the truth of the religion gets the notability not its criticism). This seems too hard to call: I will go and try to find a consensus on the issue. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BozMo, I think criticism is good when the positive sides are also acknowledged. For example, the criticism of Christianity article doesn't talk at all about the ethical reforms of Jesus. I obviously feel that from the Bible but I don't have hard WP:RS proof-texts available at the moment to be able to contribute to the article. Unfortunately I don't have a strong background in Christianity either. I plan to do some research when I get free though. There are also other reasons to discuss positive and negative points together: For example the idea of monotheism has had an enormous effect on humankind moral developments. It is clearly against aristocratic privilege and hierarchy. It leans towards equality between men in all senses. It unifies people under one religion and forms a community. Monotheists were more concerned with the situation of poor and needy. On the other hand, monotheists have proved to be more exclusivists and engaged in wars much more than others. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> writes: "Polytheism was essentially tolerant, each group worshiping its own god or gods, offering no objection to the worship of others. Indeed, one might have been willing to offer at least a pinch of incense to some alien god, in courtesy as a visitor or, even at home, in deference to a suzerain."</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I think having criticism of X articles is good since it is a response to editors who want to criticize a religon and some people are specifically looking for these criticisms and their responses.</dd>
<dd>And I think the main rival of all religions today is science not one or another religions. But I need to do some deep research on that before start writing anything. I today noticed that the Encyclopedia of Religion has an article on the relation of different religons and science. That should give us an idea of how today's leading scholars think. There is certainly a war going on, the article said. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i just want to ask one thing&#160;: The links you have deleted contains many links which contains articles which are copy righted by me (mostly technical ). For example in case of Manometer or Vena contracta .Should i stop making new technical pages by taking contant from my site.</p>
<p>you people have also blamed me for low profile spammer , you page on diesel cycle does not contain content about diesel cycle , who ever has made the page has not taken action even i and others drop few lines into discussion , so i added a relevent page which has correct description of the topic.</p>
<p>If you mind the things i will only put matters into discussion , Then please tell me how much time should i wait before doing the alteration ..</p>

<p>I would be most grateful for your advice. I have just added the paragraph below to the deletion discussion page for Royaldutchshellplc.com. I can supply the email received from the journalist mentioned if you would like to see it as proof that I am being truthful. However, you may feel that I should delete any reference to the possibility of the article. Please do so yourself if you deem it appropriate. User: JohnaDonovan. 22.09, 30 January 2007.</p>
<p>"Rather than clutter up this page with a list of links, I have compiled a list on a separate webpage. Apologies at the time taken to provide the links promised above, but other events intervened, coincidentally including a long interview with a journalist from a quality national newspaper. The contact results from the Prospect article. The intention is to publish a story about the website and the Sakhalin-2 connection this weekend. I have the emails confirming this development. However, on past experience the story could be spiked for any number of reasons, so both this and the other pending article mentioned above should obviously be entirely discounted from consideration at this time. I assume that if a collective decision to delete is made, then I could resurrect the article at a later date and provide evidence of further publication of major articles to support the claim of notability. If on Thursday the preparation of the weekend article is progressing and is likely to be published, I may ask for a delay in the decision process until Monday so that the article can be taken into account. User: JohnaDonovan. 22.00, 30 January 2007."</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice which I much appreciate. I promised to supply the "hits" figure for January for the website and the percentage of articles authored by us, compared with those from other sources. This can be done in just a few lines. I will say nothing more than that. I have been informed this evening that an article similar in content to the Prospect article will be published on Sunday in a UK quality national newspaper. A photograph of my father and I will be featured. Of course this does not guarantee that publication will actually take place. If it does, than it could be used as added evidence of notability at a later date, if needed. User: JohnaDonovan. 20.52, 31 January 2007.</p>
<p>FYI only, a major article about the website is being published in a broadsheet newspaper on Sunday. However, as per your advice, I will say nothing on the deletion discussion page and will let events take their course without further involvement by me. I have not voted because that does not seem appropriate. Thanks again. User: JohnaDonovan. 19.30, 2 February 2007.</p>
<p>Hello, thought I ought to contact you since no article has been published today. At the moment I have no idea why. A photographer took about 50 shots of my father and I on Friday and a journalist read the article to me over the phone yesterday to make sure it was accurate and that quotes attributed to me were correct. So it was good advice on your part not to make further mention on the discussion page. On request I will happily let you have copies of the email correspondence so that you can verify that I have not been fibbing and gave information in good faith. I have not named the paper here because I do not want to cause any upset in case it is just a delay. It proves that you cannot be certain until an article is actually in print.

<p>Hi Bozmo - we spoke last week regarding thebestof - and the message has gone out internally, so no further linking will be done from within TBO. The last comments from yourself and A. B. suggested that now we are sorted on the spamming issue, that in future any linking attempts will be considered by the individual editors for the towns concerned - is that correct? How does one know who the individual editor for a particular page is? I want to make sure no further transagressions are made and that approaches are done in the right way.

<p>Okay now I'm little confused, you deleted bunch of links to my website under claim they are shallower the article including those which were stated as source/reference - my website has 2000 pages!! <a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/sitemap/" class="external free" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/sitemap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/sitemap/</a> <a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/sitemap/" class="external free" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/sitemap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/sitemap/</a> Also you ONLY target my website while leaving everyone else links with even less content intact!?</p>
<p>Same thing happened with Croatian wikipedia were crazy admin removed tons of my links which people used (and still use) to write articles, I already specifically banned Croatian wikipedia (after removing few links admin missed) from using my site as source since using my website as source and then deleting links in nothing but stealing.</p>

<dd>I agree some links should were badly out of date and/or had no place on Wikipedia (i.e. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomislav_Dretar_527e.html" title="Tomislav Dretar">Tomislav Dretar</a> made his personal autobiography and added link to my website since I published his biography there), some articles are stuck both on Wikipedia and my own website because of lack on information but for few of them my website has more info then any other place on the net including official websites like <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Croatia_4fd9.html" title="Military of Croatia">Military of Croatia</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_People%27s_Army_55be.html" title="Yugoslav People's Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partisans_%28Yugoslavia%29_2e4c.html" title="Partisans (Yugoslavia)">Partisans (Yugoslavia)</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jure_Franceti%C4%87_e7c4.html" title="Jure Francetić">Jure Francetić</a>...</dd>

Only reason my entire website isn't at Wikipedia is that it is very expensive hobby so unless Jimbo is willing to cover my cost of buying books and bookshelves I need every cent I can squeeze from affiliates since PayPal and donations are still far away from being available in Croatia.&#160;:-(</dd>

<dd>hi BozMo , thanks for your reply. As i understand the standards for notability , the subject of the article must have received attention in the press and public arena. Aloka has been mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald as one of only 2 stupas in Sydney having the Buddhas relics from his birthplace. this woudl necessarily make it notable .

<dd>Gutenberg does not produce PDF. Electronic texts come in many formats. The five main formats which should have at least one representative example: a plain text version, a HTML version, a text to PDF version, a book scanned version (ie. Google Books), and a audio version (ie. LibriVox). Within each of those you can have duplicates if it warrants (different editions or substantial differences). Just because the owner of the site did the upload is not reason alone to remove it, sometimes it really is a valid contribution. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
