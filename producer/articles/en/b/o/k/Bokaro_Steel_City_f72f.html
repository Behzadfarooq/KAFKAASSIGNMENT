<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/k/Bokaro_Steel_City_f72f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Formerly there was a sleepy village named Maraphari deep in the jungles of ChotaNagpur. The closest village cluster was Chas. Purulia was the closest town and the area was ruled by the Maharaja of Kashipur. Folk lores have it that this area came under Mughal rule by the conquests of Man Singh. The region was named ManBhoom after him (VeerBhoom and SinghBhoom are the neighbouring regions also named after him, Veer Man Singh).</p>
<p>This remote place came into prominence when Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru planned to build the first swadeshi steel plant with the help of the Soviets. The proximity to coal, iron ore, manganese, and other raw materials helped in the selection of this place. The steel plant was originally incorporated as a limited company on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">29 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, and was later merged with SAIL and came to be known as <a href="http://www.sail.co.in/plants_bokaro.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.sail.co.in/plants_bokaro.asp" rel="nofollow">Bokaro Steel Limited(BSL)</a>. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw heavy construction of the steel plant as well as the township. The first blast furnace started on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. The Sector III and Camp I and II were the first to come in the township followed by Sectors II, IX, IV and so on. The first private school came in the form of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Xavier%27s_66f4.html" title="St. Xavier's">St. Xavier's</a> School which the Jesuits from Hazaribagh built on invitation from the BSL management. The 1980s saw rapid development of the township with new sectors coming up, new schools, parks, zoos and other public amenities coming up. Township development ceased with the completion of IV/F and IV/G. In all bokaro steel city consists of 12 sectors out of which setcor- 7&amp;10 do not exist. Entire township is so meticulously planned that very few cities in India can match, trees are planted all along the roads giving shelter to passersby during the summers. Every sub section of a sector has one or two huge play ground, all schools in bokaro have two to three big play grounds. The late 1990s saw sprucing up of the city park and creation of islands, new schools and the success of Bokaro's students in all India level competition exams, specially IIT's. During this period Bokaro also emerged as the eastern hub for studies for engineering after high school. Bright and hard working students of Bokaro beloging to different schoolos like DPS, DAV, St. Xavier, KV, MGM, Chinmaya etc has put it into the so called 'powerhouse' map of the country.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/k/Bokaro_Steel_City_f72f.html" title="Edit section: Economy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
<p>The economy of the Steel City is heavily depended on the Steel Plant which is the primary source of income for the employees. After the 2001 downturn, steel prices hardened due to huge rise in consumption by <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. This resulted in huge profits by SAIL which crossed a record Rs 6000 crores (USD 1.3 Bn)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> by the end of FY' 06. The primary economy is supplemented by BIADA which is an industrial area supplying most of the industrial supplies for the steel plant, and there are some small mills making finished products out of steel as well as cement from the slag.</p>
<p>The primary economy is well supported by the services sector. The city market situated at the center of the city is full of shops selling the basic requirements of groceries and furniture, to the latest tech gizmos. Of late a lot of shops selling computer hardware have come up along with a lot of computer training institutes making Bokaro a hub of computer studies for the region. The old chas bazaar still remains a cheap option of wholesale market, and <i>dundi baad</i> is one of the biggest vegetable market for the region. Besides these, each sector has its own small shopping center catering to the day to day needs of the people. Being an industrial area, agriculture has taken a back seat and is nothing worth mentioning except small amounts of paddy grown in the fringes of the city by the villagers.</p>

Jagannath Temple, Sector 4</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Kali Mandir</b> - Located in sector 8, it is one of the oldest temples of the city. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to one of the incarnations of Shakti, Goddess Kali. Besides the religious activities it is also a major socialing place for the Bengalis of the city. The temple organizes an annual painting competition attended by hundreds of students from the schools of the city. We have to go to see this place.....</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>City Park</b> - Bokaro has a well maintained City Park with an artificial lake. Recently three artificial islands have also been added. These islands were designed in Japneese style. The park used to have some small animals but they were all transferred to the Jawaharlal Botanical Garden in the early 90s. There is a small guest house that is used to host parties for visiting dignitaries. A small restaurant also stands at the eastern edge of the lake. There is a small toy train that is run for some time early every year. The park hosts an annual Basant Mela (Spring Fiesta) in early February. The southern part of the park is used by thousands during the annual <a href="../../../c/h/h/Chhatth.html" title="Chhatth">Chhatth</a> puja in October/November. A new small beautiful park opened in 1ST jan 2007 to make city park more beautiful and make people more enjoy chat new year picnic</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Jawaharlal Nehru Biological Park</b> - The botanical garden was built in the late 80s and early 90s. It has animals and birds from different parts of the world, with the big cats being the biggest attractions. The zoo came into limelight after multiple breedings of white tigers, royal bengal tigers, and the Asiatic lion over a short span of time. The cubs were sent to different zoos in India and abroad, since the available resources were not good enough to cater to the needs of so many big cats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chas</b> - Once a small grain trading hub of the region, this town first became famous during the Second World War when the British Government used it as a base to supply soldiers fighting on the eastern front against the Japanese. After the decision of Government of India to establish the Bokaro Steel Plant it gained in stature. It was the administrative headquarters of the area when Bokaro was a part of Dhanbad district, and later when Bokaro became a district. Recently the headquarters were moved to the steel township. Chas continues to be a trading hub, but has declined in importance after the rise of the township to the west.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Babudih</b> - A village in Chas Block famous for 75 foot (23 m) high tower.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pupunki Ashram</b> - The last Kasba in the Bokaro Dhanbad route is Pupunki. The village, along with its fields and captive fishery ponds is squeezed between NH-32, Bokaro-Chandrapura Railway line and the Damodar river. Opposite to this village across the NH-32 is the pious Pupunki Ashram "THE MULTIVERSITY" Established by Akhanda Mandaleshwer Sri Sri Swami Swarupananda Paramhansha Deva, popularly Known as BABAMANI. This Ashram was an age old home for Gurus who used to harbour Gaushalas with 100s of students being imparted scientific and spiritual knowledge in the past. One can still see the reminents of the past with many rituals still intact in this Ashram. This place is also a popular picnic spot these days.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chandrapura</b> - A town famous for Chandrapura Thermal Power Station, a unit of Damodar Valley Corporation. It was a big source of pollution for the adjoining areas owing to the coal based generators, but things changed after electrostatic precipitators were installed in the chimneys, and large scale afforestation was carried out. The town lies on the northern edge of perhaps the most polluted river in the world, the Damodar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tenughat</b> - Headquarters of Bermo SubDivision, famous for Tenughat Dam and Tenughat Thermal Power Station.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>Besides the steel plant, Bokaro is also known for what the students from the city have achieved over the years. Today students from all over the state and elsewhere come to the city to make a difference to their professional lives. City has provided hundreds of civil servants (IAS, IPS, IFS officers) to the country.</p>
<p>The city has a plethora of excellent schools affiliated to the central and state education boards. The more famous of these in alphabetic order are Chinmaya Vidyalaya, DAV Public School, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi_Public_School_012d.html" title="Delhi Public School">Delhi Public School</a>, Guru Govind Singh Public School, Holy Cross School, Kendriya Vidyalaya, MGM Senior Secondary School, Pentecostal Assembly School and St. Xaviers School and five bokaro ispat senior secondary school.Then there are schools run by the steel plant management, and some run by the state government. The city hardly offers anything after you have graduated from school, and this is probably a blessing in disguise, since it forces the students to look for avenues outside, and they excel in most such entrance exams.</p>
<p>The wave of success was started by Prasoon Kumar (AIR 1) and Neelkanth Mishra (AIR 4) who topped IIT JEE in 1993 followed by Chandan Mishra (AIR 3) and Late Rajeev Ranjan Rakshit (AIR 8) in 1994. Subsequent years saw students from the city excelling in all major entrance examinations of the country. The city also boasts of very large expatriate population in US, Europe, Australia and New Zealnd. Most of these people graduated from schools in the city in the eighties and nineties, before moving to some other city, and finally out of the country. But even today the city holds a special position in their hearts: home sweet home!</p>
<p>The sad part is that often after studying from these top schools and attaining almost above 90% marks, almost all of them are now settled outside Bokaro and often outside India, principally in the US and UK.</p>
<p>None of these are actually contributing to the welfare of the bokaro township in any means.</p>
