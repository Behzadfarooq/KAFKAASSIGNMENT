<p>Bokak (as Taongi Islands) is claimed by the <i>Government of the Dominion of Melchizedek</i>, an embryonic <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_state.html" title="Ecclesiastical state">ecclesiastical state</a>. The claim was rejected by the Government of the Marshall Islands<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nv/micronations/images/marshall2b.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.angelfire.com/nv/micronations/images/marshall2b.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,however, subsequent to the RMI encouraging friendly nations to avoid recognizing any claims of Melchizedek that are within RMI's territorial limits, the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroijlaplap.html" title="Iroijlaplap">Iroijlaplap</a> of Taongi declared on film which was broadcast on Australian SBS TV <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sbs.com.au" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that he granted Melchizedek a 50 years sovereign lease over Taongi, valid until 2049.</p>

<p>Bollar, what claims did Melchizedek make at the time of the RMI memo, probably none? If i remember they only had an assignment of deveopment rights, but after the memo, it was on SBS TV in Australia that they received a 50 years sovereign lease from Taongi's Iroijlaplap. (Anonymously posted by <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.123.207.17.html" title="User:68.123.207.17">user:68.123.207.17</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>DOM had already announced their plans for Bokak, as indicated on their own site as of December 12, 1998. The RMI memo directly addresses this plan. As for the SBS broadcast, please cite the source and broadcast date. Is this a broadcast of the "interview made for DOM TV?"</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>On the 4th day of September 1987, Murjel Hermios, the recognized Iroijlaplap (king or paramount chief) and owner of the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands', Ratak Chain, granted a Special Power of Attorney to Robert Moore wherein Mr. Moore as Alab, gained for 55 years, the assignable right to develop Taongi Atoll and determine its highest and best use. On May 28, 1997, Robert Moore assigned all of his rights, title and interest in Taongi; and authorized the "Dominion of Melchizedek to do every act and thing necessary to transfer unto itself said rights, title and interest, and sanction(ed) its objectives to develop, govern and administer an environmentally sound business community, investment and tax haven paradise at Taongi Atoll, ultimately styled after that of Hong Kong". According to a former DOM Minister of External Affairs for Asian Pacific, the uninhabited Taongi, located at approximately 14.35 North latitude and 169.0 East longitude is one of the most beautiful group of islands in the world. The RMI has denounced DOM's plans to move Taongi into a sovereign status under Melchizedek, yet some of the RMI's top officials have indicated a willingness to discuss the RMI officially recognizing DOM.<a href="http://http://web.archive.org/web/19981212030918/http://www.melchizedek.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://http://web.archive.org/web/19981212030918/http://www.melchizedek.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>A lot of relevant information culd be written about such atol.

<dl>
<dd>I disagree, and don't know where you get your information, because what I have learned is that far more than some low notability fraudster simply using the name of Taongi, when in fact, there is not only a sovereign lease from the recognized Iroijlaplap of Taongi to Melchizedek documented on by SBS TV Australia, but Melchizedek has official and formal diplomatic recognition as "an ecclesiastical sovereignty" from at least one UN member state and treaties of peace and recognition from three other UN member states. Not only has the fact of recognition been published by media around the globe, but Melchizedek has been featured on many international TV networks. I don't know of any micronation that has received the media attention nor the level of recognition that Melchizedek has received, regardless of the negative spin often presented.</dd>

<p>An unknown user has been editing this article as well as related articles inserting POV statements into the articles. To this unknown person, please stop. If you would take the time to read and follow the rules of Wikipedia you would have alot more sucess in getting your point across. Instead, you push your own agenda regardless of the guidelines set by Wikipedia. Until you do so, myself as well as others will continue to revert the vandalism that you insist on adding to these articles. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 9/14/05 10:25 (UTC)</p>

<dd>David: Please look up Wikipedia's meaning of vandalism, and note that Bollar added Melchizedek to this topic, not I, and you are the one that is obsessed with removing it, as i'm only trying to restore it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bokak_Atoll&amp;oldid=5910940" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bokak_Atoll&amp;oldid=5910940" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bokak_Atoll&amp;oldid=5910940</a> with reasonable editing, however, I do appreciate your trying to help me to get my point across. I'm a slow learner and am making slow progress in this regard. Please be patient with me. Regards, John <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.124.49.20.html" title="User:67.124.49.20">67.124.49.20</a> 21:07, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless, your claims have not factual basis. You continue to revert this page back in violation of the rules of Wikipedia. The last 5 edits were done by you under the unidentified user 67.124.49.20. I'm not sure how you are claiming someone else posted those revisions. Maybe a ghost did it? Nevertheless, we will continue reverting this page and ban you if necessary.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 9/15/05 4:22 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>David, there is plenty of evidence of the factual basis for the editions all of which I believe I have provided. Please take a specific point that you believe is not factual and lets take one point at a time. I'm not saying the last 5 reversions with id 67.124.49.20 weren't mine, I'm saying that Bolar is the one that started mentioning Melchizedek on this page, not me! Cordially, John <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.124.49.20.html" title="User:67.124.49.20">67.124.49.20</a> 07:19, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off, just because you say that someone (in this case Bolar)talked about something, doesn't give you the right to post anything you want. Reading back through the conversation, it was indeed you that mentioned ROM first. Second, there has to be a concensus of people that agree with the facts that are in dispute. You have failed to take that into consideration. If I went to the page for Bush and started spouting off things that were unproven, I'd get banned. This is what happened to you. If you would like to play by the rules, then great. How hard is it to sign up for an ID if you have no ill intentions? Please answer that question. I hope you enjoyed your vacation from Wikipedia, as I'm willing to give you one anytime you need it. Sincerely, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 9/15/05 2:24 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>David, I really don't think that I have violated the spirit of the rules here as all of my work has been in good faith. The example you give of spouting off about Bush is way off base. You didn't give me any words that I wrote quoted back to me that you feel is spouting off. I believe that my numerical id is more honest than a lettered one, because the numbered one gives a more real id, i.e. phyical or cyberspace location and makes it harder to make multiple ids. I don't recall if I was first to mention Melchizedek on the talk page, but I'm certain that I wasn't the first to mention it on the article page, so if you really believe what you wrote give me the link that predates Bollars that I showed above. My only point is that I'm not the one to have the idea to put Melchizedek in this article, but can't understand why some feel it doesn't belong there. If my rewrite of Bollar offends you let me know what part is so bad, and recommend a change to it. Looking forward to your more studied response and more success on my part from this approach. Sincerely, John <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.124.49.20.html" title="User:67.124.49.20">67.124.49.20</a> 07:42, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, your IP is not that real of an ID as I learned the hard way today. I reverted what I thought was vandalism based on an IP address of someone who had been trashing pages. Someone told me that more one person can be working of that IP. I'm just trying to point out that it can cause some confusion. Second, I'm not trying to be mean, I really do think you should try to build more of a consensus on what you are trying to add to the article. Just because you agree with the proof, doesn't mean a large number of Wikipedians agree with it. So my suggestion is to revert the edit, I won't put vandalism this time. Instead I will put "See Talk Page" or something similar. Hopefully that will be seen as a kinder more gentle act by you. Thus we will be at a truce.</dd>

<dd>Davidpdx, OK, I took your advice and got a user name. It won't take 500 pages to get my point to you, as it isn't that complicated. Let's just take one point at a time. You can pick the first thing that you see I have posted and give me the reason that it isn't correct, and I'll give you my response, how's that? When I tried to click onto your name above it sent me somewhere other than your page.

<dd>Yes, I did drop the ball. The reason is larger then just simply this page, but more over some of the bs that is going on Wikipedia. I got into a hot argument with someone over another page due to the political garbage (much worse then what is being posted here) that was being posted. I basically blew off Wikipedia for a few days.

<dd>I have severe doubts about the claim. The thing I'm trying to prevent is a revert war. Basically I'm saying, let's settle this once and for all. After that, if it continues it then becomes vandalism in my opinion. There are discussions going on in terms of what to do about the pages for <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_state.html" title="Ecclesiastical state">Ecclesiastical state</a> and <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_government.html" title="Ecclesiastical government">Ecclesiastical government</a> as well. The same claim is being made on those pages as well as many others. At some point it's either provide the proof and see if it's sufficiant, if it isn't then it can't be posted anymore. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 9/29/05 7:43 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Davidpdx, this may be the place that I felt you approved a version that I endorsed, and if I misread you here I ask for you to forgive me, as it was an honest mistake. As Drini said that he liked the new version much better which was a version that was just posted before he wrote that, and your response led me to believe that you liked the toned down version, where you wrote, "you would hope so", in response. Additionally, I think you misunderstand my approach which isn't to prove that DOM is good in any way, but to let readers decide the case by putting both sides of the story there from acceptable sources and build it from things that there is already consensus for.

<dd>Bokak (as the "Taongi Islands") has been claimed as part of its sovereign territory by the "Government of the Dominion of Melchizedek", an entity, aspiring to statehood, that has a history of licensing banks that defaud investors. The only basis for this claim seems to be related to a "sovereign master lease" granted by the Iroijlaplap of Taongi Atoll.</dd>

<dd>I think it is much easier to deal with this seperately because it is a much smaller issue than the entire Melchizedek story. Therefore, over here please consider that this version appears to perfectly factual and balanced, because it has claimed as part of its sovereign territory Taongi and DOM clearly is an entity, aspiring to statehood, that has a history of licensing banks that defaud investors. This gives the counter balance in a polite way, that "The only basis for this claim seems to be related to a 'sovereign master lease' granted by the Iroijlaplap of Taongi Atoll." There is no dispute over whether or not the Iroijlaplap granted such a lease, only the fact as to the meaning of the lease, which should be left for readers to decide without opinions of our writers inserting stuff.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelSpade_9457.html" title="User:SamuelSpade">SamuelSpade</a> 22:46, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respectfully disagree, it is very much part of the Melchizedek issue. If it can't be proven that Bokak Atoll or any other territory it claims is legitimate, then it should not be mentioned in this article.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to the claim of it being "perfectly factual and balanced" this is something neither you nor John has proven yet. If you look at John's talk page, I posted links to the rules on Wikipedia in terms of sourcing. The proof that the two of you are using is not sufficent at this point. If I don't change it, I guarentee someone else will. You can't simply break the rules that are set by Wikipedia to create what you think is a fair and balanced article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of this article and the DOM article, there is still no consensus. Therefore, until there is it has to remain as it is written currently.

<dd>There is consensus that the Iroijlaplap of Taongi was seen on SBS TV saying that he "granted Melchizedek a 50 year master sovereign lease over Taongi." The only dispute is over the significance of that lease. The way this is written now clearly lets the reader decide the significance of that instead of a Wikipedian making his or her opinion of its meaning, so please revert to the compromise version that is clearly factual and balanced. If you don't revert it, you can be sure someone else will. This is clearly a smaller issue than the entire article about Melchizedek. While the entire article of Melchizedek may never be resolved and end up a reversion war, this issue is small enough to resolve now.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelSpade_9457.html" title="User:SamuelSpade">SamuelSpade</a> 20:18, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Davidpdx, Gene, here is a quote that has been left the same by every editor for very long time and is in the protected version, that both of you have reverted to, quoting from the DOM article: "the recognized <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroijlaplap.html" title="Iroijlaplap">Iroijlaplap</a> (chief) of Taongi appeared on an Australian television current affairs programme in which he was quoted as saying he granted Melchizedek a 50 year sovereign lease over Taongi Atoll."</p>
<p>Can we agree that the rest of the article gives the necessary discloures? I think it is best not to use more inflamatory language hoping not to upset people like Wikifacts.

<p>I have removed the Melchizedek nonsense from this page. This is an uninhabited sovereign territory of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and they haven't given it away to anyone. Furthermore, nobody from "Melchizedek" has ever set foot there, nor are they ever likely to, and hence they have no way of asserting their "claim". Indeed, the fact that they "claim" it is totally meaningless. They might as well "claim" the moon. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 13:48, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Centauri, The only reason that most people know about Taongi is because of the lease that Melchizedek has over it, from Taongi's Paramount Chief. Melchizedek's claim to Taongi has been mentioned in several credible news sources, and is in the Wiki article about Melchizedek, a micronation. Micronations are one of the 500 most popular topics in Wikipedia. We don't know if any Melchizedekian has ever set foot on Taongi, and it really doesn't matter either way. You have been accused of being a sock-puppet of Gene Poole and as you both use "nonsense" so often that encourages me to believe the argument. Having a claim to the moon is a far fetched comparision. And a lease from a Iroijlaplpa is not meaningless. Sincerely, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 18:48, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The paragraph that begins "A Wikipedian article about the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a>..." cannot be placed into this article because it is a violation of the guidelines in <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:16, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The paragraph is also clearly not approved by the consensus of the editors on this article, as only one has attempted to insert it, but several have reverted. It has definitely not won consensus on the talk page. Consensus on the talk page is necessary when you insert something and it is reverted: the reversion indicates that consensus does not yet exist and you should discuss your change and obtain consensus on the talk page before inserting it again.</p>
<p>Johnski, this edit warring has got to stop. The three revert rule is not a license to make three reverts per day. You are consistently making as many reverts as you possibly can so that you violate the spirit of the law while not violating the letter. That's unacceptable. I'm going to look into where I can report you for this.</p>
<p>If you want to have any hope of exerting any influence over these articles, you had better listen up and start confining yourself to proposing changes on the talk page and waiting for consensus before editing articles. Otherwise you are going to be reverted by multiple editors as long as you are here and will ultimately find yourself blocked because of edit warring. You can and will be blocked for edit warring even if you have never technically violated the three revert rule.</p>
<p>I want to encourage you to read completely through <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarmonious_editing_club_c3f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club">Wikipedia:Harmonious_editing_club</a> before proceeding.

<dd>Mr. Davids: It appears you have never taken the time to read or study a subject for which you claim to be experts. The parts that are quoted come from the article about Melchizedek that you and your supporters have repeatedly reverted to, and Gene Poole, et al have edited to their liking, are those portions. The real reason, as I see it, is that you just don't like the subject, so you want to remove it from Wikipedia. To me, the subject is interesting, and famous enough like other subjects to be covered in all of its notorious aspects. Melchizedek claims Clipperton, but I don't see that that is worth including in the Clipperton article, because that claim doesn't rise to the fame of Taongi and Solkope, nor are there leases involved.<a href="../../../k/a/j/User%7EKAJ_fcba.html" title="User:KAJ">KAJ</a> 19:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Johnski, I never once claimed to be an expert on DOM. You are wrong, I have read some about DOM and I do honestly believe it is a fraud. I have no problem with their being articles on the issue on Wikipedia, but they must (as the rules state) have the sources to back them up. You have repeatedly made claims that did not have the sources or used bogus sources (such as the blog) to try to prove points. In addition, you have reverted pages without consensus, lied about having consensus, misrepresented the rules of Wikipedia to push your own agenda and so on. If you want to continue to sit on your high horse and scream foul, that's fine. However, myself and others are not going to allow you to hijack Wikipedia to further your own cause. That's not why Wikipedia is here. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 19:20, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As to your accusation that I lied, please tell me what lie you think I told? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 00:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is you that is reverting articles that you don't agree with merely because you don't want to hear or see anything about DOM, which is the issue that makes this article most worth having in Wikipedia, as has gotten the most news for Taongi that I can find. I quoted from the article about DOM that you claim has consensus, that you repeatedy reverted to, but you can't accept that, and lie that there is no consensus for the facts quoted about the Iroijlaplap lease to DOM. Another lie is that you claim that I am a sock-puppet. It may not be intentional that you lied, but when I have more time, I'll try to find the other lies I've noticed in the past.<a href="../../../k/a/j/User%7EKAJ_fcba.html" title="User:KAJ">KAJ</a> 08:00, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad your claiming self-rightously that you've never committed an act in bad faith. That should be pretty easy to counter since you, Johnski, have reverted many articles including the DOM article (60+) and yes this IS ON RECORD. Maybe you should just go put your head in the toilet and flush it. That's about how clueless you are about your own behavior. 09:43, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. Davidpdx: Are you ready to humble yourself and admit that you "comitted" any acts in bad faith. It is really funny you calling me "self-rightous" when you are the one that has been saying that you are the only one right and everything that I and those that I agree with are either puppet-masters, sock-puppets or are never right about anything. I've seen efforts to bend your way, but nothing coming from you, with the exception of Solkope, which you are now taking back. Your behavior has been less that that hoped for in Wikipedians according to <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a>. Perhaps I should examine myself, but I doubt that I've been self-righteous. It has been pointed out to you that you shouldn't call a good faith edit/reversion attempts vandalism, but in your self-righteousness you continue in that behavior. In mean words, you have called into question my intelligence, but I have tried to be civil towards you. Nevertheless, I admit that I have not always followed the highest standards of Wikiquette. Your many false and mean accusations make you the self-righteous one.<a href="../../../k/a/j/User%7EKAJ_fcba.html" title="User:KAJ">KAJ</a> 18:50, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This looks good. I don't think it's a good idea to list "Gene Poole" and "Centauri" as separate users, since there is a belief that these two people are the same user (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=18864451&amp;oldid=18864198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=18864451&amp;oldid=18864198" rel="nofollow">look here</a>); however I have dealt with this editor before, so go ahead and add my name to the list. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a>, 16:41, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost all of your edits have been to add DOM content when other users do not want the content in question. When a new editor appears out of the blue and takes sides in a controversial edit, we assume the editor is a sockpuppet; even if it is a separate person, it is still considered a sockpuppet. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 06:13, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said on the DOM page, all we ask is that you follow the rules of consensus. The truth is your didn't have consensus, yet you still reverted articles. That is not good faith. If you agree to follow the rules, there is no arbitration and the pressures off. The ball is in your court. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 06:30, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editing During Arbitration</span></h2>
<p>Since arbitration is going forward, no one should be editing this article. Everyone involved should wait for the outcome of the arbitration case before anything else is done. I would hope this is just merely common sense, but I guess I have to say it.</p>
<p>If either <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solkope.html" title="Solkope">Solkope</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/k/Bokak_Atoll_d124.html" title="Bokak Atoll">Bokak Atoll</a> are edited again, I will ask for a TRO and/or page protect against editing. Honestly, I shouldn't have to do this, but if it becomes necessary I will. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 13:49, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a reminder, the Arbitration case is still yet to be decided. This page has been unprotected by systops, however it is still possible to protect again if it is reverted. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 07:36, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
