<p>Boost Mobile is a rip off. I had the premium service for almost a year. Every month they would debit my account two days early, they made it difficult to cancel the plan, and for some odd reason every day when my free night minutes were suppose to kick in, my phone would be down for about two hours. The last time they debited my account early, I asked them to cancel the plan and put me back into prepaid status. The "Supervisor" did not explain to me that I would loose my $49.99 that they had already taken out of my bank account. She made it seem like I would get a charge back to my account and would just go back to being prepaid. Two months later I am still trying to either get my money back or the $49.99 credited back to my phone. They have a million "Supervisors" who don't help and a lot of miscommunication going on. I asked for a phone number and address that I could call/write to to file a complaint, and they don't know that either. If anyone has any information please let me know. Because I don't think this is fair. I just got hustled out of 50 dollars on Boost Mobile's behalf. Word of mouth is something serious and Bad business is never good. So think twice before you sign up with Boost Mobile. They don't even know how to get in touch with their corporate office.</p>

<p>I was watching the Travis Barker Boost Mobile commercial, and what caught my attention was that "Kid" Travis's trainer had long-ish hair. Keeping my eyes focused one the trainer, I though he looked like HHH, which would make sense, seeing as there are a lot of muscle bound WWE Wrestlers. So, could perhaps someone could see if that is indeed a HHH Cameo? <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.96.98.74.html" title="User:65.96.98.74">65.96.98.74</a> 05:37, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just found out that when a stranger uses the Walkie Talkie feature, you get charged 1 USD, even if you don't respond. Basicly, they might have workers who call random BM customers just to make them lose money from their accounts. I am putting up one of those nuetrality things until all the mentioned critism is properly put in place. --Can Not 14:45, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Check the Boost Mobile TOS. I know on Nextel-- if *you* Walkie-Talkie *me* and *I* respond to you before 5-6 seconds and we volley- back and forth without having any 5-6 second pause on either end the whole--- call will be billed to the person that initiated the connect (in this case you).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, If you walkie-talkie me. And the symbol on the phone actually goes away after 5-6 seconds and then I chirp you and bring it back up and we Volley again back and forth then you're seen as an initiator of a 6 second call. And then I would be billed for however long our second chat continues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's sort of confusing but to simplfy it think of it this way. When the chirp is pressed it raises that small tab on the screen. If you-- caused the tab to be raised it's tallied under your minutes. If the tab goes away and I bring it back- then I pay for it. This is true of Nextel I'm not certain about Boost. I would say your safest bet would be to chirp them right---back immediately so that you don't end up initiating the call and thus risking the fee. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 15:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me state this in very simple terms: I did nothing. I was charged $1.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the complex version: I recieve a call early in the morning, I do not respond or press any buttons because I do not recognize the number, then later BM's website says I am charged $1 for the walkie talkie feature. A feature that I did not use. I do not use the walkie talkie feature, I have never given out my walkie talkie info, and I do not know anyone else's walkie talkie number. It is completely indisputable whether or not this is an unfair charge. Even if their ToS allows this, it <i>is</i> important to point out unfair business practices. This is either a (widespread) billing error, or a malicious attack on customers. I would normally think the second would be silly, if they did not charge $2.99 for 14 seconds of music as opposed to $0.99 for a whole song (<a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a>). --Can Not 23:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's likely you accidentally bumped the alert button on your phone when checking who was calling you. With Boost, if you even press that button when someone chirps you or you have a number up, it's treated as a valid walkie-talkie use and charged. As to ringtones, that's the pricing every company out there does. Ringtones are a ripoff, but the music &amp; cell industries have a stranglehold on the pricing. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>!!!!!!VIEW FROM THE INSIDE!!!!!! Here you guys go, this is a view from the inside of Boost Mobile and some celarification to all things mentioned on this page.</p>
<p>When you are speaking to a "Boost Mobile" supervisor you are actually speaking with a regular care rep, not an actual supervisor. Actual Supervisors know nothing of the inner workings of Boost Mobile. You see Boost outsources their customer care to three companies Teleperformance USA (TPUSA), Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), and Accent. While Boost standardizes the training that reps get, the three companies are competitors and do not operate on the same page. Only ACS gives it's employee's proper training. At several sites, Supervisors have never even spoken to a boost mobile customer. The most knowledgeble people you can speak to are the care reps that answer the phone. As far as speaking to Boost Corporate is concerned, good luck, contact information is not provided to the three companies because the people at Boost Corporate, wouldn't know how to handle anything without contacting Customer Care themselves.</p>
<p>As for billing issues, it is impossible for Boost to confirm if someone uses the Walkie-Talkie service or not so "TOS" include that if the Walkie-Talkie is intiated both parties are charged $1....it is actually the cheapest way to go, lots of money saved. Ringtone downloads and other downloads are provided through 3rd party vendors and Boost is not at fault for their short comings. Alot of people dont understand the cell phone industry, alot of the charges that appear on your account are not from Boost Mobile, and care agents are not provided any contact info for third party companies.</p>
<p>Yes, Boost mobile does have it's downfalls, but coming from someone who has had years of experience in customer service and cellular technolgies, let me just say "learn everything you can about Boost Mobile" Why?? Because it really is the best pre-paid phone out there. just take time to understand what you are buying</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have <a href="../../../n/e/x/Nextel.html" title="Nextel">Nextel</a> and my plan has unlimited chirp.... When I first got it, I got chirps from all kinds of people I didn't know... No doubt because someone before me had the same walkie talkie number... (similar to if you get someone's old telephone number.)</dd>
<dd>Reason being, don't forget Nextel, Boost Mobile, SouthernLinc, or even Telus in Canada etc. etc. etc. Or- for that matter any company with an <a href="../../../i/d/e/IDEN_02cf.html" title="IDEN">iDEN</a> made phone by Motorola can chirp to one another.... It may cost you "International Rates" to some chirp numbers, or even local to others but none the less different iDEN carriers have different "area ID's" given out by Motorola and different "Network ID's" that the Carriers themselves hand out See the article on <a href="../../../m/o/t/MOTO_Talk_7db8.html" title="MOTO Talk">MOTO Talk</a> for more information about the Motorola's "MOTO Talk" service(Which Nextel/Boost rebrands as the name "CHIRP"). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 02:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I work for one of the support companies listed above. There's no phone number for the corporate office to register complaints, but you can leave feedback through the Boost website, or through the PO Box the agents give you when you call in. And yes, any time you use the chirp, you get charged, even if you're responding to someone else's alert. Plus, as <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> pointed out, phone &amp; walkie-talkie numbers do get recycled. It's especially bad on pay as you go carriers, as they have a higher turnover rate than standard phones.</dd>
<dd>I would step in to edit the article to be more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, but since I work their tech support there might be a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> issue. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fail to understand the complaints of bias. Seems to be rather factual and fails to even mention significant favourable info like Boost Mobile is by far the largest pre-paid cellular provider in North America. I know of no factual basis for the statement "Boost will be adding postpaid options next year, which may threaten to put it in almost direct competition with Nextel."</p>

<p>"By far the largest pre-paid cellular provider in North America"? Really. How many subscribers do they have? How many does Virgin Mobile have? 65.124.139.139 15:44, 5 April 2007 (UTC)Paladin</p>
