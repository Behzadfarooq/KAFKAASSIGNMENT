<p>The <i><b>Book of Common Prayer</b></i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> is the foundational prayer book of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> (and hence <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>). It was one of the instruments of the Protestant <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> in England, and was also adapted and revised for use in other churches in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. It replaced the various 'uses' or rites in Latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in English so that "now from henceforth all the Realm shall have but one use". First produced in 1549, it was drastically revised in 1552 and more subtly changed in 1559 and 1662. It remains, in law, the primary liturgical prayer book of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, although it has, in practice, been largely replaced by more modern prayer books, the most recent of which is <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Worship_74eb.html" title="Common Worship">Common Worship</a></i>. The Book of Common Prayer is also the name of the current liturgical book in the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church</a> of America as well as some <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> churches.</p>

<p>The work of producing English language books for use in the liturgy was, at the outset, the work of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cranmer_521e.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> under the reign of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>. Whether it was Cranmer who forced the pace or whether the King was the prime mover is not certain, but Cranmer was not one of the "advanced thinkers" who were in touch with contemporary German reform, but rather an observer. His first work, the earliest English-language service book of the Church of England, was the <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhortation_and_Litany_%281544%29_c328.html" title="Exhortation and Litany (1544)">Exhortation and Litany</a>. This was no mere translation: its <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> character is made clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints, compressing what had been the major part into three petitions. Published in 1544, it borrowed greatly from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litany.html" title="Litany">Litany</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/l/Myles_Coverdale_2a26.html" title="Myles Coverdale">Myles Coverdale</a>'s <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, and was the only service that might be considered to be "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>" to be finished within the lifetime of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a>.</p>
<p>It was not until Henry's death in 1547 and the accession of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a> that the reform could proceed faster. <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranmer.html" title="Cranmer">Cranmer</a> finished his work on an English <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Communion</a> rite in 1548, obeying an order of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> that Communion was to be given as both bread and wine. The service existed as an addition to the pre-existing Latin <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a>.</p>
<p>It was included, one year later, in 1549, in a full prayer book, set out with a daily office, readings for Sundays and Holy Days, the Communion Service, Public <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a>, of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation.html" title="Confirmation">Confirmation</a>, of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrimony.html" title="Matrimony">Matrimony</a>, The Visitation of the Sick, At a Burial and the Ordinal (added in 1550).<sup id="_ref-Comm_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Comm" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began: "There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted". The original version was used until only 1552, when a further revision was released.</p>
<p>The 1549 introduction of the Book of Common Prayer was widely unpopular especially in places such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> where traditional religious processions and pilgrimages were banned and commissioners sent out to remove all symbols of Roman Catholicism. At the time the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_people.html" title="Cornish people">Cornish</a> only spoke their native <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_language.html" title="Cornish language">Cornish language</a> and the forced introduction of the English Book of Common Prayer resulted in the 1549 <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer_Book_Rebellion_a7d0.html" title="Prayer Book Rebellion">Prayer Book Rebellion</a>. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into Cornish were suppressed and in total some 4,000 people lost their lives in the rebellion.</p>
<p>The 1552 prayer book marked a considerable change. In response to criticisms by such as <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietro_Martire_Vermigli_7cc6.html" title="Pietro Martire Vermigli">Peter Martyr</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bucer_1193.html" title="Martin Bucer">Martin Bucer</a> deliberate steps were taken to excise Catholic practices and more fully realize the Calvinist theological project in England. In the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, gone were the words <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a>; gone was the '<a href="../../../k/y/r/Kyrie.html" title="Kyrie">Lord have mercy</a>' to be replaced by the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>; removed to the end was the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria.html" title="Gloria">Gloria</a>; gone was any reference to an offering of a 'Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving' in the Eucharistic prayer, which ended with the words of institution (This is my Body..This is my blood...in remembrance of me.) The elevation of the host and all other manual acts were omitted. The part of the prayer which followed, the Prayer of Oblation, was transferred, much changed, to a position after the congregation had received communion. The words at the administration of communion which, in the prayer book of 1549 described the eucharistic species as 'The body of our Lorde Jesus Christe...', 'The blood of our Lorde Jesus Christe...' were replaced with the words 'Take, eat, in remembrance that Christ died for thee..' etc. The Peace, at which in earlier times the congregation had exchanged a greeting, was removed altogether. Vestments such as the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stole.html" title="Stole">stole</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasuble.html" title="Chasuble">chasuble</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Cope.html" title="Cope">cope</a> were no longer to be worn, but only a surplice. It was the final stage of Cranmer's work of removing all elements of sacrifice from the Latin Mass. In the Baptism service the signing with the cross was moved until after the baptism and the exorcism, the anointing, the putting on of the chrysom robe and the triple immersion were omitted. Most drastic of all was the removal of the Burial service from church: it was to take place at the graveside. In 1549, there had been provision for a Requiem (not so called) and prayers of commendation and committal, the first addressed to the deceased. All that remained was a single reference to the deceased, giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world'. This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped-down memorial service designed to definitively undermine the whole complex of traditional beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer.</p>
<p>Before the book was in general use, however, Edward VI died. In 1553, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a>, upon her succession to the throne, restored the old religion. The <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> was re-established, altars, roods and statues were re-instated; an attempt was made to restore the Church to its Roman affiliation. Cranmer was punished for his work in the Protestant reformation by being burned at the stake on March 21, 1556. Nevertheless, the 1552 book was to survive. After Mary's death in 1558, it became the primary source for the Elizabethan Book of Common Prayer, with subtle if significant changes only.</p>
<p><a name="The_1559_prayer_book" id="The_1559_prayer_book"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Edit section: The 1559 prayer book">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1559 prayer book</span></h3>
<p>Thus, under <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>, a more permanent enforcement of the Reformed religion was undertaken, and the 1552 book was republished in 1559, along with laws requiring conformity to the new standards. In its Elizabethan form, scarcely altered, it was used for nearly 100 years, thus being the official prayer book under the Stuarts as well as being the first Anglican service in the American colonies. This was the prayer book of Queen Elizabeth I, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donne_3c1c.html" title="John Donne">John Donne</a>, and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_28e0.html" title="Richard Hooker">Richard Hooker</a>. It was also at the core of English liturgical life throughout the lifetime of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The alterations of the 1559 Prayer Book from its 1552 precursor, though minor, were to cast a long shadow. One related to what was worn. Instead of the banning of all vestments save the rochet (for bishops) and the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surplice.html" title="Surplice">surplice</a> for parish clergy, it permitted 'such ornaments...as were in use...in the second year of K. Edward VI'. This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain at least some of the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration. It was also to be the basis of claims in the 19th. century that vestments such as chasubles, albs and stoles were legal. At the Communion the words 'the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ' etc. were combined with the words of Edward's second book, 'Take eat in remembrance..' etc. The prohibition on kneeling at the Communion was omitted. The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that Elizabeth's Protestantism was by no means universally popular, a fact which she herself recognised; her revived Act of Supremacy, giving her the ambiguous title of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Governor_a6b4.html" title="Supreme Governor">Supreme Governor</a> passed without difficulty, but the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Uniformity_7b8f.html" title="Act of Uniformity">Act of Uniformity</a> passed through Parliament by only three votes.</p>
<p>Still, the 1559 Prayer Book offered enough to both traditionalists and radical reformers to establish it at the heart of the first relatively stable Protestant state in Europe -- the "Elizabethan settlement." However, on her death in 1603, this book, substantially the book of 1552, having been regarded as offensive by the likes of Bishop Stephen Gardiner in the sixteenth century as being a break with the tradition of the Western church, as it was, by the seventeenth century had come to be regarded as unduly Catholic. On the accession of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I</a>, following the so-called <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenary_Petition_84cc.html" title="Millenary Petition">Millenary Petition</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Court_conference_4e9c.html" title="Hampton Court conference">Hampton Court conference</a> of 1604, a meeting of bishops and Puritan divines, resisted the pressure for change (save to the catechism). By the reign of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> (1625-1649) the Puritan pressure, exercised through a much changed Parliament, had increased. Government-inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy 'root and branch' resulted in local disquiet in many places and eventually the production of locally organised counter petitions. The government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between Catholics and Protestants, but between Puritans and those who valued the Elizabethan settlement.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> The 1559 book was finally outlawed by Parliament in 1645 to be replaced by the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory_of_Public_Worship_cea2.html" title="Directory of Public Worship">Directory of Public Worship</a> which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book. How widely the Directory was used is not certain; there is some evidence of its having been purchased, in churchwardens' accounts, but not widely. The Prayer Book certainly was used clandestinely in some places, not least because the Directory made no provision at all for burial services. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Lord Protector <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell</a>, it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to England.</p>

Laud's abortive 1637 Prayer book</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the uniting of the two thrones, King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_2c18.html" title="Charles I">Charles I</a>, with the assistance of Archbishop Laud,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> had sought to impose the prayer book on Scotland. The book concerned was not, however, the 1559 book but very much that of 1549,the first book of Edward VI. First used in 1637, it was never accepted, having been <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Geddes_6342.html" title="Jenny Geddes">violently rejected</a> by the Scots. Following the English Civil war, the Church of Scotland was re-established on a presbyterian basis but by the Act of Comprehension 1690, the rump of Episcopalians were allowed to hold onto their benefices. For liturgy they looked to Laud's book and in 1724 the first of the 'Wee Bookies' was published, containing, for the sake of economy, the central part of the Communion beginning with the Offertory. Between then and 1764, when a more formal revised version was published, a number of things happened which were to separate the Scottish liturgy more firmly from either the English books of 1549 or 1559. First, informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the eucharist; secondly, as a result of Bishop Rattray's researches into the liturgies of St. James and St. Clement, pubished in 1744, the form of the invocation was changed. These changes were incorporated into the 1764 book which was to to be the liturgy of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> (until 1911 when it was revised) but it was also to influence the liturgy of the Episcopal Church in the United States (See below). (A completely new revision was finished in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, and several revisions to the communion service have been prepared since then.)</p>

<p>The 1662 prayer book was printed only two years after the restoration of the monarchy, following the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savoy_Conference_2ffd.html" title="Savoy Conference">Savoy Conference</a> convened by Royal Warrant to review the book of 1559. Attempts by <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterians.html" title="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a> led by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Baxter_d32d.html" title="Richard Baxter">Richard Baxter</a> to gain approval for an alternative service book were in vain. In reply to the Presbyterian Exceptions to the book only fifteen 'trivial' changes were made to the book of 1559, some of which were the opposite of what they wanted. Among them was the inclusion of the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offertory.html" title="Offertory">Offertory</a>. This was achieved by the insertion of the words 'and oblations' into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the Table (instead of being put in the poor box) and the bread and wine placed upon the Table. Previously it was not clear when and how bread and wine were produced. The so-called manual acts, whereby the priest elevated the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration, which had been deleted in 1552, were restored. After the communion the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away and used for any other occasion. By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further subverted, leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite. One change was made that constituted somwhat of a reversion to Cranmerian theology was the re-insertion of the so-called Black Rubric,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> which had been removed in 1559. This declared that kneeling in order the receive the communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor 'to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood' - which, said the rubric, were in heaven, not here.</p>
<p>Unable to accept the new book 2,000 Presbyterians were deprived of their livings. This revision survives today as the "standard" Parliament-approved <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> in England, with only minor revisions since its publication (mostly due the changes in the monarchy and in the dominion of the former Empire). Many parishes still use it, but usually only for an early morning Sunday communion, or evensong. Most services in the Church of England are from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Worship_74eb.html" title="Common Worship">Common Worship</a>, approved by General Synod in 2000, following nearly forty years of experiment.</p>
<p>The actual language of the 1662 revision was little changed from that of Cranmer, with the exception of the modernization of only the most archaic words and phrases. This book was the one which had existed as the official <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> during the most monumental periods of growth of the British empire, and, as a result, has been a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches worldwide, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgies</a> of other denominations in English, and of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> as a whole.</p>

<p>After the 1662 prayer book, development ceased in England until the twentieth century; that it did was, however, a bit of a close run thing. On the death of Charles II his brother, a Roman Catholic, became <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James II</a>. James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith, whose practices were still banned. This, however, drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery'; talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air. But with the flight of James in 1688 and the arrival of the Calvinist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a> the position of the parties changed. The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without, therefore, their having to submit to the Church of England, even with a liturgy more acceptable to them. They were now in a much stronger position to demand even more radical changes to the forms of worship. John Tillotson, Dean of St. Paul's pressed the king to set up a Commission to produce such a revision The so-called <i>Liturgy of Comprehension</i> of 1689, which was the result, conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of 1661; but when it came to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convocation.html" title="Convocation">Convocation</a> the members, now more fearful of William's perceived agenda, did not even discuss it and its contents were, for a long time, not even accessible. This work, however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies.</p>
<p>By the 19th century other pressures upon the book of 1662 had arisen. Adherents of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Movement_bf89.html" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, begun in 1833, raised questions about the relationship of the Church of England to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship. Known as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractarians.html" title="Tractarians">Tractarians</a> after their production of 'Tracts for the Times' on theological issues, they advanced the case for the Church of England being essentially a part of the 'Western Church', of which the Roman Catholic Church was the chief representative. The illegal use of elements of the Roman rite, the use of candles, vestments and incense, practices known as <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritualism.html" title="Ritualism">Ritualism</a>, had become widespread and led to the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Worship_Regulation_Act_1874_94ce.html" title="Public Worship Regulation Act 1874">Public Worship Regulation Act 1874</a> which established a new system of discipline, intending to bring the 'Romanisers' into conformity. The Act had no effect on illegal practices: five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved Bishop <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_King_%28English_bishop%29_4631.html" title="Edward King (English bishop)">Edward King</a> of Lincoln, it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon. Following a Royal Commission report in 1906, work began on a new prayer book, work that was to take twenty years.</p>
<p>In 1927, this proposed prayer book was finished. It was decided, during development, that the use of the services therein would be decided on by each given congregation, so as to avoid as much conflict as possible with traditionalists. With these open guidelines the book was granted approval by the Church of England Convocations and Church Assembly. Since the Church of England is a state church, a further step—sending the proposed revision to Parliament—was required, and the book was rejected in December of that year when the MP <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Joynson-Hicks%2C_1st_Viscount_Brentford_a3d8.html" title="William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford">William Joynson-Hicks</a> argued strongly against it on the grounds that the proposed book was "papistical" and insufficiently Protestant. The next year was spent revising the book to make it more suitable for Parliament, but it was rejected yet again in 1928. However Convocation declared a state of emergency and authorised bishops to use the revised Book throughout that emergency.</p>
<p>The effect of the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further attempts were made to change the book, other than those required for the changes to the monarchy. Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led eventually to the publication of the 1980 <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Service_Book_b9f3.html" title="Alternative Service Book">Alternative Service Book</a> and subsequently to the 2000 <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Worship_74eb.html" title="Common Worship">Common Worship</a></i> series of books. Both differ substantially from the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service altering only one or two words and allowing the insertion of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) before Communion. Order One follows the pattern of modern liturgical scholarship.</p>
<p>In 2003, a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> adaptation of the BCP was published called the <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Divine_Worship_990d.html" title="Book of Divine Worship">Book of Divine Worship</a></i>. It is a compromise of material drawn from the proposed 1928 book, the 1979 <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">ECUSA</a> book, and the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Missal_ff3d.html" title="Roman Missal">Roman Missal</a>.

<p>With British colonial expansion from the seventeenth century onwards, the Anglican church was planted across the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the use of the Prayer Book, until they, like their parent, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which come under the general heading of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical_Movement_fbc4.html" title="Liturgical Movement">Liturgical Movement</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a></b> separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, having been established in the United States in 1607. Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources, the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Seabury_df37.html" title="Samuel Seabury">Bishop Seabury</a> of Connecticut has brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup>. The preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says that "this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require." There were some notable differences. For example, after the words of institution there follows a Prayer of Oblation follows from 1549, but into which were inserted the words 'which we now offer unto thee' (in small caps) with reference to the 'holy gifts' An <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiclesis.html" title="Epiclesis">epiclesis</a> was included, as in the Scottish book,though modifed to meet reformist objections. On the whole the book was modelled in the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> and modified the Scottish Liturgy to bring it substantially into line with the English.</p>
<p>Further revisions occurred in 1892 and 1928, in which minor changes were made, removing, for instance, some of Cranmer's Exhortations and introducing such innovations as prayers for the dead.</p>
<p>In 1979, a more substantial revision was made. There were now two rites for the most common services, the first which kept most of the language of 1928, and the second using only contemporary language (some of it newly composed, and some adapted from the older language). Many changes were made in the rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions. However, there was arguably a greater degree of continuity than was the case in England, which may account for the fact that all the books of the series, from 1790 to 1979 retain the same title. The 1979 book owes a good deal to the Liturgical Movement and to the 19th century Catholic revival.</p>
<p>Even so the revision caused some controversy and in 2000 an apology was issued by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church to those "offended or alienated during the time of liturgical transition to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer".</p>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a></b> , known until 1981 as the <i>Church of England in Australia and Tasmania</i> became self-governing in 1961. Among other things the General Synod agreed that the Book of Common Prayer was to '...be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this Church...' In 1978 <i>An Australian Prayer Book</i> was produced which sought to adhere to this principle, so that where the Liturgical Committee could not agree on a formulation, the words or expressions of the BCP were to be used. The result was conservative revision.</p>
<p>In 1995, a similar process could be observed as elsewhere with the production of A Prayer Book for Australia which departed from both the structure and wording of the BCP. The process was accompanied by numerous objections, notably from the deeply conservatively evangelical <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Anglicans_dad0.html" title="Sydney Anglicans">Diocese of Sydney</a> which noted the loss of BCP wording and of an explicit 'biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement'. On the other hand, the rest of the Australian church has not proved as difficult as prayer book revisers might have supposed. The Diocese of Sydney has developed its own small prayer book, called <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Services_e286.html" title="Sunday Services">Sunday Services</a>, to supplement the existing prayer book and preserve the original theology which Sydney asserts has been changed.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Canada_1d0f.html" title="Anglican Church of Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a></b> developed its first Book of Common Prayer separate from the English version in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. The revision of 1962 was much more substantial, bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive 1928 book in England: the language was conservatively modernised, and additional seasonal material was added but, as in England, whilst many prayers were retained the structure of Communion service was altered: a Prayer of Oblation was added to the Eucharistic prayer after the 'words of institution', thus reflecting the rejection of Cranmer's theology in liturgical developments across the Anglican Communion. A French translation, <i>Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne</i>, was published in 1967.</p>
<p>After a period of experimentation with the publication of various supplements, the <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Alternative_Services_aaa5.html" title="Book of Alternative Services">Book of Alternative Services</a></i> was published in 1985. This book (which owes much to Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and other sources) has widely supplanted the 1962 book, though the latter remains authorised. As in other places there has been a reaction and the Canadian version of the Book of Common Prayer has found supporters.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_South_India_5e7f.html" title="Church of South India">Church of South India</a></b> was the first episcopal uniting church of our age, consisting as it did, from its foundation in 1947, at the time of Indian independance, of Anglicans, Methodists, Congregationists, Presbyterians and Reformed Christians. Its liturgy, from the first, combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherance to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the Eucharist, much in line with the Liturgical Movement. Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non-Christian culture, practice varied wildly but the retention of Cranmerian language, and a sympathy with his theology, in the 2004 revision, is a reminder of both the richness of his language and the breadth of his influence.</p>

<p>The <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> has had a great influence on a number of other denominations. While theologically different, the language and flow of the service of many other churches owes a great debt to the prayer book.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a>, an Anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a> wrote, "I believe there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety than the Common Prayer of the Church of England." Many Methodist churches in England continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the 20th century.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> adopted a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_of_Paul_VI_a3d5.html" title="Mass of Paul VI">revised mass</a>, many translations of the English prayers followed the form of Cranmer's translation.</p>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> The <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_title.html" title="Long title">full name</a> of the English <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> is <i><b>The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the Church of England together with the Psalter or Psalms of David pointed as they are to be sung or said in churches and the form and manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of bishops, priests, and deacons</b></i>.</li>

<li id="_note-1"><b><a href="#_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> <i>Prayer Book and People in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England</i> by Judith Maltby (1998)</li>
<li id="_note-2"><b><a href="#_ref-2" title="">^</a></b> The work was primarily that of the two Scottish Bishops, Maxwell and Wedderburn: Perry ibid</li>
<li id="_note-3"><b><a href="#_ref-3" title="">^</a></b> It was so called because of the 19th. century practice of printing it in black type (as distinct from red normally used for rubrics - though it was not actually a rubric at all, but a declaration).</li>
<li id="_note-4"><b><a href="#_ref-4" title="">^</a></b> The ecumenical liturgy of the Church of South India (1950) was followed by the Liturgy for Africa (1958) which was taken up in East Africa (1966) and Nigeria (1966); others were to follow - see below.</li>
<li id="_note-5"><b><a href="#_ref-5" title="">^</a></b> The Scottish liturgy itself derived from Archbishop <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laud.html" title="Laud">Laud</a>'s 1637 revision of Cranmer's first book of 1549: <i>The Scottish Liturgy - Its Value and History</i> W. Perry (Mowbrays 1922)</li>
<li id="_note-6"><b><a href="#_ref-6" title="">^</a></b> <i>An Historical Account of the American Book of Common Prayer</i> W.McGarvey D.D. The General Convention of 1785 proposed, inter alia, that the Psalms be freely revised into sixty centos, the Nicene Creed removed from the Holy Communion, and the Apostles Creed altered, and removed from the Baptism Service. Adherence to the liturgy of the Church of England was 'disgusting to many of our Communion who neither like the doctrines held by the Church of England, nor the liturgy as it now stands'- Revd. W. Parker of Boston in a letter to Dr. White, later bishop of Pennsylvania.</li>
