<p>I think Champion of Champions should be added within his titles history. I think its a valid title just like King of the Ring, or Royal Rumble Winner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Yeah I don't really see why it's not in there... <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickurass00_08e4.html" title="User:Kickurass00">Kickurass00</a> 22:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Champion of Champions probably won't be added in unless they have another Champion of Champions match again at Cyber Sunday next year. Until then just leave it out I guess. <a href="../../../5/t/i/User%7E5TimeWCWChamp_039e.html" title="User:5TimeWCWChamp">5TimeWCWChamp</a> 04:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC) King Booker won with the help of K FED thts ALL!</p>
<p>Still it should be there even if they dont use it again as he still has the title. he now and again states that he is the champion of champions. Maybe not in title history as it is not a title like the world heavyweight championship but maybe at the start of the article. (where it states his real name and that he is a six time world heavyweight champion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack6989_9e62.html" title="User:Black6989">Black6989</a> 13:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)Black6989</p>

<p>In the WWE book <b>Unscripted</b>, Booker says that is son has a lot of anger toward him and they have a strained relationship.Just thought I would add this.<a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMgHoneyBee_39e0.html" title="User:MgHoneyBee">MgHoneyBee</a> 03:35, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says before going into the succession lists that Booker T has won the title 36 times. So why list all of them? I propose that the list be clipped to only show the WCW heavyweight, WWE US Title, WCW US Title, and WWE Intercontinental title, if even those last two. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamionOWA_5283.html" title="User:DamionOWA">DamionOWA</a> 04/10/06</p>
<p>So why list all of them? Because it's important! Every wrestler has every known championship succession listed like that. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrosk_f539.html" title="User:Trosk">Trosk</a> 16:31, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The boxes have dissappeared, someones deleted them (time is 18.41, 1st June 2006). Is it possible to reverse vandalism? I can't find his championship reigns anywhere</p>

<p>That's not his name. He may have said he was going to do it. But as of May 23rd, he is still known as Booker T. I'm changing it back.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The person that put it in ran with an article on a wrestling site that WWE had trademarked the name. However, it shouldn't be put in until he actually is referred to it in the ring announcements.</dd>

<p><sup>Booker is the first black champion in WWE. The Rock doesnt count as he looks samoan and is samoan. Someone compared it to Halle Berry but you can tell shes black.

<p><sup>Whether his blackness is noticeable or not is irrelevant. Just because he looks more Samoan doesn't change the fact he is also black. He's black as well as Samoan, therefore the first black champion.

<p>actually his blackness is 100% relevant because he is the first actual african american to win a world title in wwe. The Rock isnt African American he is African Samoan.

<p>Your right his blackness is 100% relevant (I was talking about The Rock's "blackness" btw, not Booker's), your changing your argument. I said whether his blackness is <b>noticeable</b> is irrelevant. And he is not African-Samoan. He is African-American AND Samoan. His dad is African-American, his Mom is Samoan, making him both.

<p>The Rock is not african american. therefore he is not the first african american champion. to even suggest this is a insult to every black person there is. The Rock, as great as he may be isnt black hes a mix. Eddie Guerrero was the first mexican champion because he was full blooded mexican. Booker is the first African champ because hes just that African. <a href="../../../w/r/e/User%7EWrestlinglover420_7c01.html" title="User:Wrestlinglover420">User:Wrestlinglover420</a></p>
<p>So you're saying then that Halle Berry shouldn't considered the first black woman to win an Oscar because she has a white mother and black father? My friend, you are insulting African Americans by saying The Rock isn't one, and you are also insulting Racially-mixed people by basically telling them you don't count for anything because you are more than one race. The Rock's dad is African-American, Therefore The Rock is considered African-American, making him the first African-American World Champion. And I quote "'When he was a child, Dwayne asked me what he was, and I told him,' says Rocky Johnson. 'And I taught him to appreciate and represent the Black race because that's what I did.'"

<p>Thats exactly what im saying. Rock is not black hes a mix period. He may be the first half black champ but he is not the first black champion. Besides that Halley Berrey and wrestling are two different things. <a href="../../../w/r/e/User%7EWrestlinglover420_7c01.html" title="User:Wrestlinglover420">User:Wrestlinglover420</a></p>
<p>So racially mixed people don't count for anything? And as for Halle Berry and wrestling, yes they are two different things, but the situation is the exact same. Halle Berry and The Rock are of mixed races. Halle Berry is "half-black" but yet considered the first black woman to win an Oscar. The Rock is "half-black" and therefore is considered the first black person to win a WWF/E World Title. I have even provided you with a reliable source that says so. <a href="../../../b/m/g/User%7EBmg916_32e8.html" title="User:Bmg916"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">B</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">mg</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">9</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">1</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../b/m/g/User_talk%7EBmg916_77ed.html" title="User talk:Bmg916"><font color="navy"><strong>Speak to Me</strong></font></a></sup> 17:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you provide me with a link from WWE where they clearly state The Rock is the first black WWE Champion then ill beleive you. Until then a rumor website does not count. Im not saying that mixed races dont count. I'm saying they dont count the same as some who is full breed. <a href="../../../w/r/e/User%7EWrestlinglover420_7c01.html" title="User:Wrestlinglover420">User:Wrestlinglover420</a></p>
<p>Well, do you have a link from WWE or PWI that states Booker and NOT The Rock is the first black WWE Champion? If not, then Booker is not considered the first black champion either. And yes, they do count the same as "full-breed" in this world.

<p>The Rock is the first WWE Champion of African-American descent. That is the encyclopaedic bit. Classifying people on how brown or white or green their skin is has no place on Wikipedia. Saying Booker T is "blacker" than the Rock is asinine and sounds like the Wiktionary definition of racialism (<i>The belief in the existence and significance of racial categories</i>). <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 19:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether Rock is 100% black, 50% black, or even just 10% black, he is still black. He was the first black world champion in WWE, plain and simple. You are the one insulting all African-Americans by saying he isn't black just because he is mixed.

<p>Whoah... Wrestlinglover420, did you honestly use the term "full breed"...??

<dd>You are wrong, period dot dash. The Rock is black, he won his first world title before Booker, even a 6 year old can put 2 and 2 together.

<p>The Rock is not black! He has never stated he was black. He always puts how hes a proud samoan. As a matter of fact I remember everytime he was champ never once did he even say he was black. He might be bothe but he counts his samoanism more.

<p>Just because The Rock doesn't state he is black, doesn't mean he isn't black. And by the way, yes, he does say he is black. Just because someone doesn't state their race doesn't mean that they aren't of that race. The Rock's dad is black, therefore he is black, just get over it already. <a href="../../../b/m/g/User%7EBmg916_32e8.html" title="User:Bmg916"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">B</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">mg</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">9</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">1</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../b/m/g/User_talk%7EBmg916_77ed.html" title="User talk:Bmg916"><font color="navy"><strong>Speak to Me</strong></font></a></sup> 21:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Justice is served? The Rock is black, and the first black champion is WWE. That is a FACT and there is no arguing against it. You are 100% wrong, whether you admit it or not.

<p>What kind of dumb thread is this? The Rock is half-black half-samoan thus he is the first ever period. -<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame"><i><b>DDF</b></i></a></p>
<p>(Hybrid bangs head on desk.) The Rock is of African descent, so he is the first black champ. Saying that he isn't black enough, or it isn't obvious enough, or whatever is subjective. POV won't change the way we consider things. The Rock was the first, period.

<p>I have edited before but it gets reverted back. Something about being to specific. on certain topics. SuperCalo 23:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was probably what we call <i>week-by-week</i> information, meaning that it wasn't notable to his overall career. For one example, an unsuccessful title match before a feud unrelated to the title. It seems notable at the time, but it doesn't affect the course of his career, so it really isn't notable. This is a more specific form of the policy stating that Wikipedia isn't a repository of random information. The results of unimportant WWE matches fall under this category, and <a href="../../../p/w/_/WP%7EPW_f376.html" title="WP:PW">WP:PW</a> has been at this long enough to recognize a match that will be unimportant in the long run, so we remove them on sight. I hope that I have been helpful.
