<p>Hi Boothy,</p>
<p>I wasn't the one who added the <a href="../../../g/e/t/GET-UP_7c13.html" title="GET-UP">GET-UP</a> comment (you can see my non-anon work on <a href="../../../g/e/t/GET-UP_7c13.html" title="GET-UP">GET-UP</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/s/GESO_3e71.html" title="GESO">GESO</a>, <a href="../../../g/s/o/GSOC_331a.html" title="GSOC">GSOC</a>, etc. I agree with you that the poster went overboard ("our" votes were never counted) but I've been thinking for a long time that the Penn page needs a controversy section like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> has. There definately should be something about the following controversies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Summit and Spice Rack sit-ins</li>
<li>Rodin's compensation package</li>
<li>Rodin's positions on multiple corporate boards while President</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trammell_Crow_c128.html" title="Trammell Crow">Trammell Crow</a> affair</li>
<li>The decade old and the more recent crime problems</li>
<li>The "Water Buffalo" incident</li>
<li>The death of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Gelsinger_7cd9.html" title="Jesse Gelsinger">Jesse Gelsinger</a></li>
<li>Union busting in the case of:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The Hospital workers</li>
<li>Facilities (Trammell Crow again)</li>
<li>GET-UP</li>
<li>Allied Barton security workers</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>No doubt there is more. I've been a little unwilling to do it partly becuase of the time required and also because I wasn't sure if it should have its own page or if it should go on the main page. So while the anon post was obviously inapropriate I think it's about time that the controversy section was started. Your thoughts? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 01:18, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Boothy, thanks for your comments! I can definitely see your point about people overdoing it with criticisms, although I think there is definitely a place for it. I think that the Summit and Spice Rack issue would fit nicely in the "History" section, as it's not a current criticism and resulted in a prohibition of secret research which continues to this day. Rodin's issues probably really belong on her own page (mentioning that she sat on the board is NPOV, and I think mentioning that faculty and students questioned this is also ok). The "water buffalo" thing belongs on Hackney's page, as it really defined his presidency in the end. So that leaves the union issues, which I think definately need to be on Penn's page. I'm sure it can be covered without taking up much of the article - I'll try to do it at some point. I wonder if there should be a "criticisms of US academic institutions" page? As they say on the Harvard page, many of the "corporate university" criticisms are levelled at most other Universities too.</p>
<p>ps. Just wanted to make sure you saw the top of my other post (I wasn't sure what you meant by "my honesty in the matter"). I think it should be obvious from my other work that I would know better than to write a tirade at the top of an article! <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 16:16, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I can help out but probably not for a bit (maybe next weekend). Someone (you?) suggested removing the list of majors, that'd be a good start (or spinning it off, that would be fine, although I really don't think it's necessary). Some Penn undergrads have a pretty serious complex about how "world class" Penn is - it is a very good school, and it does do very well in the rankings, but the recent anon poster who said that Penn is unknown outside of the US is also right. I think it would even be fair to say that it's mostly unknown outside of the NorthEast. This may be in the process of changing, but I don't think anyone who lives in Pennsylvania could be a fair judge of that. Do you know of any really good pages for a school to look at for ideas? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 17:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The time that you made the change, for the second, was <i>before</i> you mad your comments at the workshop, and after i invited you to the worksop to discuss the changes, and the time stamps can back me up on that. Also you did not post anying on the workshop untill after your changes were reverted. So to call me a liar is just false, considering you were invited to make a comment before you tried to implement your changes also calls into question your willingness to participate, along with your now comments above, in the worksoop to gain a consesus. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 07:39, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have received this message because you have edited a Salt Lake City media article in the past.

<p>Hi! I have added another option to the survey which I believe is a better option than the others as it removes a large amount of bias and the "drop and paste" statements that occur in the other versions.

<p>Have to disagree with culling the extra categories. It seems with the category section you would want as many as possible. The point of them is to make the actual category page itself as robust as possible. Besides, if you are going to cull Irish American then you might as well pull the vaguest of all categories - 1962 births. --<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooper5920_0b5b.html" title="User:Looper5920">Looper5920</a> 07:41, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your comments would be welcome at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>. One user, without even bothering to go through the proper procedures, wants to rename the article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">Prime minister</a> and keeps moving it to push that version!!! While there is an article for all uppercasing or all lowercasing, half-casing (which is all WP allows, as all lowercasing is not possible in article titles) would produce a semi-literate mess that would make WP a laughing stock.

<p>There are many names, such as place names and common words (e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>) where primary topic dis-ambiguation is appropriate. However, I see no reason to use primary topic dis-ambiguation for callsigns such as WCAU. What reason is there for callsigns to use primary topic dis-ambiguation?? (The most likely reason for this according to my speculation is that the primary one is current and the other(s) ceased to have the callsign more than 10 years ago. Is this the correct reason??) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 00:01, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have recently discovered in other templates how to use a void most effectively, see Template:Infobox Irish University for my implementation; the option uses class="hiddenStructure{{{"variable"|}}}" which is quite effective and simple. With this option you get a very clean table even if a variable is not used - the variable prevents the row from appearing altogether as if the table was tailored for the article.</p>
<p>See, for example, how <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_Ireland_e8c2.html" title="National University of Ireland">National University of Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Inns_cb41.html" title="King's Inns">King's Inns</a> differ with the same template. Could be useful for the mirad of Irish city, county and town infoboxes; as it has the potential of being effective for one master template.</p>
<p>All the best. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 23:03, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well it was just a matter of time before the admin responce happened, and it just goes to show how lazy that this particular admin only looking at the surfface whiule solding me. Apparently he failed to examine the prior malisious attempt that the other user has engaged in regarding the subject, how that the other usere continues to disregared and ingnore the general consesus of editors on the subject, which are loged on the Phildealphia, Pennsylvania page, not to make the change or to merge. The user admin also disregards that user is attempting to divert subvert a CFD decision on the category, which was no change based on lack of majority <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_November_8#Category:_Philadelphia_County" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_November_8#Category:_Philadelphia_County" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, in which the user has ststed that he will disregard and which he has proven by his actions. What i find more disappointing then you actionis and apathy, is the apathy of other useres to stand up and activatly take on this malicious user whos edits at best are now better then bad faith and vandlism, as per my interpertation of the vandalism policy (considering that all ploicy is left open to user interpertation) would include blanking (removing articles form a category in order to seek it eventual deletion), Official policy vandalism (disregarding of a cfd decision that did not allow for the deletion of the category, as well as a disregard and active oppisition of editiors general consensus on the dispute), Talk page vandalism (while his actions have not constituted vandalism the user has remove comments that were not personal attcaks from other useres on the subject that do not conform with the users stance all of which can be found in the history of his talk page). And his edits to said pages involved are no less then distruptive. But as usuall this will fall on deaf ears. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 08:27, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My dear Boothy Sir, I would suggest that comments implying general shortcoming/s on any particular group of wikipedians may please be avoided: such sweeping comments serve no purpose, except generating avoidable stress, and is detrimental to the interest of the project. By the way, warnings once issued are sufficient, and issues like <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">three revert rule</a> are well codified and generally accepted policies. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 07:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sorry but i disagree, i belive that all useres should actively confront the misuse and abuse of powers of the admin structure, becausw it is the realiscitaly the useres that threw an "election" that give the admins the powers in which the have, theifor should it not be that that admins are answerable to use as usere on their conduct, bscuase i find a lot of their actions to be detrimental to the interest of the project. As for the merrits of the 3rr, i am not arguing with them, but with the enforcment of the mish-mash of policy, which is so rediciously open to interpertation, that we intrust thses other usere to perform. I am sorry but i do not see this project, in its current stucture, being suscessful 5 years let alone a year down the line, and i am just waithing for the announcment that a takeover bid. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 08:27, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you are free to disagree. But, if you re-read my comments you will discover that I was not talking in the context of any particular group of users, I was talking with reference to all concerned, and was indicating the negative insinuation implied in your comments towards a particular group of users, in their specific capacity. All administrators are basically editors, and to be an administrator is not a big deal, to be a good editor, in the wiki-environment, is more important, and this environment implies the ability to work collaboratively and constructively, in an environment of trust, goodwill, and mutual respect. As regards the future of the project, I am unable to comment, as I do not have a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>. I am not sure whether a non-profit organization like Wikemedia Foundation may be subject to a <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeover.html" title="Takeover">takeover</a> bid, as the term is understood in the normal sense. I have remained an optimistic, and shall continue to be so.

<dd>But you are, while you do not come out an blaently say that they arew directed to particular usere or a particular set of users, just by making the comment in the context of this dicussion infers that a particular group of users is being "called-out". My thing would be that if you did not ant to infer, in either a blaent, subduded, or inadvert, you should have not stated what you did. As for my comments being negative, yes their are, and i have no problem with them being that way, based on the actions and comments that your peers engage in. While i understand admins are editors, they are not editors on the same level that i am, they are editors that have been granted addational powers, thatgiven them the ability to restrict users activites, acess to pages for editing puropes, delete pages, among other things based upon their individual interpertations of wikipedia policy and guidlines, with no realistic oversite of their actions. To say that is not a big-deal, is a joke, thats a sigificant amout of power that is granted, with basicaly nil chance of it being removed. More or less admins are the police of wikipedia, but they also seve as judje, jury and exctioncutior as well, thats a big deal. How would you like it if the police just ddecided to go around you town, and just start interpertation laws as they see fit, not saying that they dont, but at least their is some oversite to the sructure where as here their is pratically none. If it was so not a big deal, then ever user should be granted the same power as the admins, or their should be no admins at all, because if it is not big deal, we really dont need admins then. And if thats how you fell about it, then ovibious you dont take your position seriously, and i would recomend that you step down. As for your wiki-environment, while its great that you tout the company line, and the compay line looks and sound great, and dont get me wrong, i love to see it happen, the reality is, that it is far from the case here, and the actions of the admin structre on up, from their enforcment to the policy is not condusive, in my opinion, to leading this "project" towards this utopian goal either. As for Xiong, while i do not agree with actions all of the time, i understand where he is coming from.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 09:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Howdy Boothy,</p>
<p>I noticed your comment to Borghunter, and it motivated me to say hello. I always respected your RfA oppose votes, because I believe in the example of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Plumer_93c4.html" title="William Plumer">William Plumer</a>, and admire respectful dissent, even where that dissent is likely to have little influence, and is mostly symbolic. I'm surprised, though, that you were so strongly upset by a passing comment like BorgHunter's; surely, you understand that the price of repeated symbolic acts is that one becomes known as a symbol? Or, is it that you objected to comparisons with MassiveEgo, who has few useful edits apart from his votes, and is thus less respectable in some way? Just wondering, sympathetically, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:05, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of thank you for your comment, i am not to up on the ideas of Mr Plumer so i will have to examine that further. As for dissent, i have always belived that dissent, or at the least a devils advocate, is an important role in any community in which community opinion is requested to form matters of policy and direction, i cant say thay i am the best at it, and i find it disturbing that their is not more of it here, but have my own opinions in why that is the case. I would not say i was strongley upset, even if he had not made the comment i would have still opposed on the basis fo that i do not belive that 3.5 months is a long enough time for any user (regardless of the number of edits) to quailify as a admin. More so i was distressed at the comments, made by this user. Why, well first off this person is a admin, regardless of the age of the user, all admins need to be held to a higher standard of user conduct, which i belive also includes comments made about other useres in a open setting such as a talk page. Secondly this usere on both his user page and talk page quotes dont be a dick as being one of the creeds that he belives in, while he does not exactly say that the box infers that, yet makes a comment that is very much dickish. Basically i find his comment, which based upon the the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> that i have been blocked on, also could be considered a personal attack as well. As for MassiveEgo, i can not say one way or their other, prior to the incident i was not aware of any user called MassiveEgo nor am i aware of his conduct, but i will say that in the context that the user used in his comment, it sould be infered that the user is making me out to be a sockpuppett of MassiveEgo or visa versa, which i will state is not the case. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 05:23, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that still is my opinion, as I was refering to the numberous times that you violated WP:NPA before. Just because one time I don't think you should have been blocked does not mean that I do not think that you violated the rules on previous occasions. Stop being so dramatic, you could have dropped this act along time ago and would have been better for it.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 03:19, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No i think you mare acturcatly stated your opinion on the RFA, the way i see it i have violated the NPA no more then it has been violated aginst me, but to be honest this has less to do with npa then it does my oppisition of adminstrator actions, and the RFA admin handout. To say that i violated the npa on this occasion is no less a joke, espically since the comments are comming from people whos comments about me have been no less then personal attacks. As for me being dramatic, i'll stop being that way when their is fiar play. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 03:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well once again i am not supprised by the good ol'boys club, protect their own and overlook the descressions of their own. I fail to see any reason why i was blocked and the other person was not, other then he an admin, for that the same reson that i have been blocked his comment is no lee an PA as well. The only thing i can say is that either you really didnt read either comment, or you didnt understand the context of either comment, which either way would not supprise me, considering that their is shoot first then disuss for the next several days. Oh well so i guess the policy is when you question a admin on their interpertation of policy, your gonna get blcoked, thats got to keep the peons in line, social order. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 05:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would recomend that the next time you make an accusation that you have at least something to back it up with, otherwise it called a lie. Prior to this incident i have never commented on, or to <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">User:BorgHunter</a>, let alone even knew that their was such a user, to say anyting different to that, at ulike yourself i can site the 2 coments that were made prior, is a lie. As for your other comments, i would hope that you be just as offended by the comments of an admin aginst another user, how would you have like that a admin described you as a troll, which based upon the impression of massiveego that i have recived from other usere is not favaborable, yet the admin has never interacted with you nor contacted you to discuss you actions. Now i am not saying you are a troll, but i would think, in beliving that your some kinda of reasonable person, that you would not take to kindly to Comments. Anyway even if he had not made the comment, i would have opposed the nomination anyway. I'll just take it to your age, as for your reaction, also, i'll go to say that you did not understand the context of either comment, but i would recomend that you would come up with evidence before making fanciful accusations aginst other users. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 05:42, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have attached a <b>direct copy and paste</b> of your oppose vote and its responses. And for the record, I <i>would</i> be offended at such comments by an administrator, and would probably be more offended, as Admins are supposed to be those we look up to.

<dd>Yes i am, considering that his comments were made in direct relation to the nomination, in what i see as no less an attempt to discredit my opinion, which i find unacceptable by an admin,. As for seeing civil or NPA, whould you also like to point that to BH, as his comments towards myself, were no less civil, nore less of a personal attack then any comment that i made towards him. And also as i stated before, even if i had not opposed on the grounds of the nominator not acting in a civil matter in his nomination and his discussion of his nomination with the nominee in which he made a PA (as it is being enforced aginst me) aginst another useres voting activity, i would still have opposed the nomination anyway.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 23:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well i am only following the example set by admins, who on a regular basis, also violate the same rules that they enforce aginst others. As well as a gross misinterpertation of poorly done regulations, which seem to absolve admins and above of praticaly any indescression of policy that they do them selves. I have been acused of violating point, by opposing a nomination, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_27#Weyes:_The_Fat_Lady_Sang" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_27#Weyes:_The_Fat_Lady_Sang" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, yet the usere who accused me of that, never requested a reason nor the the nominee, nor could that person state any point that i was trying to make.

Based upon the broad deff of what a personal attack is, ot that a PA is in the eye of the beholder, i do consider thee comments made by the useres, regardless of the context they were made in or what they refered to, to be nothing less then personal attacks aginst me. As for Point, i dont belive in the policy, it agin is another exaple of an i-ll defined openend social policy that basically has alloed usere to define it any way that they want. The keep point of the policy is distruption, a part of the policy that is overlooked, guess what <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruption_55ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruption">Wikipedia:Disruption</a> points to, vandalism, so beign that i am not vandaling anything i cant be called breaking point, which cant be broken anyway as it is not a poicy but a guideline. The only times that i have seen it really being use is aginst other useres who are in oppsition, with the straw man statment being basically, sicne you dont agreee with us/or you dont do as well do, then your activity is trying to distrupt the normal activity of wikipedia, i am sorr i just cant get with a policy(guideline) that can be so brodaly defined, and is used outside of the area in which is was basically defind for. As for your support of his comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABorgHunter&amp;diff=36161871&amp;oldid=36104668" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABorgHunter&amp;diff=36161871&amp;oldid=36104668" rel="nofollow">here is the diff</a>

<p><i>"And by the way, your comment was nothing like a personal attack."</i></p>

To me thats an endorcment. Prior to the enggement, i was not aware that their was a user called massive ego, so basically i took it (as writtern and in cotext) as if i was going on a ego trip, in whcih i was not, which i find a PA,. Since then i have invesgated Massiveeggo and his issues, in which he also has been accused of editing in bad faith/being a troll. So i find BH comments, regardless of my prior actions and comments, to be saying nothing less then i am a troll/bad faith editor, which i find coming from a admin to be unacceptable, and i find it even more unacceptabel in that way that he states it as a good thing to discredit myself, in my actions in voting, espcialy in the consideration of an rfa he in nominating, i see his comment as being nothing less then a discounting of my voice. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 09:18, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
