<p>Since this usage of Boot Camp was invented yesterday, April 5th, I don't think it should be the main page for boot camp.

<p>It provides an Apple machine the ability to emulate a PC by providing *code* that allows it to do so. Hence, translation emulation, at least in my book. I agree the distinction between compatibility layers and translation emulation is sometimes slim, but in this case it overcomes BIOS incompatibility, significant hardware differences and everything. Translation emulation, in other words.</p>
<p>Oh, also, the main *point* of translation emulation is that an operating system has the capability of running *natively* on the same processor. Just because something *natively* can use the same processor doesn't mean every other bit of hardware is native; a good example is the Amiga running classic Macintosh software.

<dd>Please take five minutes to read up on what Boot Camp actually does. <b>Boot Camp only does TWO things.

<dd>Mattabat, Dude, The CD that has to be burned has NOTHING to do with running Windows. It is a Driver package that is needed for windows to interact with the Macintosh hardware. Why? Because Apple hardware is designed to run on a system running OS X. When I installed XP on my iMac, XP booted and ran on my hardware, but XP had dificulty interacting with my hardware properly until I had installed the drivers. Debate with me if you want. I'm talking about what I saw and did for myself. To call Boot Camp emulation, is nothing more than speculation. It's not emulation, because Apple isn't pretending to have a X86 processor. I does have an Intel inside. It's not pretending to have a Bios, It has an EFI that has enough things in common with a BIOS to boot Windows. Boot Camp is a Boot Loader.</dd>

<dd>Also, here's the deal with the re-partition. WINDOWS CAN NOT EVEN SEE OR INTERACT WITH HFS, OS X RUNS ON HFS. Why would you want to put an OS onto a partition that it can't see or interact with? That's just asking for trouble. Plus, Why would you want to have Windows on the same Partition as OS X? That's just asking to have one OS screw up another OS. --Liquidmark 21:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't help but think that a "boot loader" that allows an operating system to load that was *designed* not to work with it is for all practical purposes emulation. The architectural differences between the two machines are significant. Just because it's not as obtrusive as the average emulator application and doesn't operate as an application doesn't mean it isn't emulation. Just because a system doesn't pretend to not have the same processor doesn't mean it isn't emulation. There are examples of this, hence the Translation Emulation article. BTW, I am aware that some other emulators let you share filesystems (WinUAE for instance) and I agree the results are not always pretty - so what? Other emulators take advantage of partitions, e.g. Shapeshifter/Basilisk II.Mattabat 11:42, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not emulation, because Windows is not running "on top of" other software. Windows runs on newer Apple hardware the exact same way that it would run on a Dell, Compaq, or HP. Yes, you need device drivers, but you would need them on a Dell too. Emulation is when you start one operating system first and then start the second one on top of it. That's not what we're doing here.Mobrienil 05:31, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am completely aware of the firmware update. I installed the software myself, didn't I? But in my mind, both are part of the same package. Without the firmware update, there is no reason to download Boot Camp. Without Boot Camp, the user would have to whipe their hard drive and repartition it yourself. This causes the user to loose all of their old data, which is unappealing. The software doesn't resize anything. It repartitions (On the fly) part of your Hard Drive into a format that Windows can work in. Your hard drive is still the same size.</dd>

<dd>I agree mostly but I assume Boot Camp must resize your partitions since it seems rather unlikely that your existing Mac/HFS partitions would not fill up the hard drive completely (unless you purposely left space when install MacOSX I guess, if that's possible). Point being, I suspect Boot Camp does usually non destructively resize partitions, it couldn't work otherwise. NB, if you have have an existing partition that is 30gb and you change it to become 20gb, that's resizing a partition. There's no two ways about it.</dd>
<dd>Of course, your HD is still the same size, if anyone actually thinks your HD can change size, they probably shouldn't be using a computer, let alone Boot Camp. I'm not quite sure however what the relevance of the fact Boot Camp resizes partitions has to do with anything. It doesn't affect whether it's an emulator (clearly it's not) or anything of that sort... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:56, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed - this is rubbish. What the user is probably referring to is a VLK edition of Windows XP that he got from his university, in which case it would just be Windows XP Home or Professional. There is no special student edition. --<a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbrown_535f.html" title="User:Mrbrown">Mr. Brown</a> 01:04, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The academic license versions (as they're actually called) of XP are typically XP Professional using a VLK which needs no activation.

<p>I don't understand it. Since 1984, Macintosh users have been going on about how superior the Mac OS is over the supposedly junky, inferior, glitchy, crashing Windows. I've known many Macintosh users who swore they'd never, ever touch Windows. However, now that Macintosh computers can run Windows, everyone who uses a Mac is super-excited to install Windows on their Mac. Does that make any sense, especially based on the last 23 years of Mac loyalty? 72.43.143.92 20:09, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some of us are pragmatists, not zealots. Most sensible people would agree the ability to run multiple operating systems is a good thing, whether some users choose to or not. Jshiell 10:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand that and you're right, but I'm pointing out the faulty logic that many Mac fanatics have used for the past several years. Remember the "Think different" and "It just works" campaigns? How about the current "Mac vs. PC" campaign? Apple has tried to make Windows look like a difficult, glitchy, stupid piece of junk for years, but the truth is that now Mac users are buying Windows. Way to go, Apple. 72.43.143.68 14:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll give me take on this. It's been said and should be said again, Apple wants to sell hardware. OS X has never been a major revenue generator for them. By allowing people that have only used Windows their entire lives to have the option to buy a Mac now versus a Dell increases Mac sales, which keeps revenues up and keeps the stockholders happy due to increased market share and hardware sales. The idea is, those who no nothing but Windows will at some point use OS X on their new Mac's and may fall in love with it, therefore creating yet another dedicated OS X user. Case in point: I was able to switch someone simply by owning a MacBook. He used my old PowerBook and wasn't quite thrilled. He said OS X was crap and just liked Windows better. However when I showed him my new MacBook and how it boot both Windows and OS X he went out and bought one a week after he used my Mac for the day. He said the ability to boot Windows was a strong reason for his purchase. However, every time I see him using his Mac he's in OS X! I think it's a solid strategy overall, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Games are simply written for Windows, and I am so happy that I can use both Windows and OS X on my computer for the reasons of gaming. Simply put, if you don't like Windows, don't install it. As long as OS X is tied to Apple hardware the strategy is golden and it's still a better OS. I only use Windows for games, which is not very often. And my friend, and old Windows junky who bought a Mac because it could boot windows rarely ever uses it now. So obviously there's still 'something' about OS X over Windows. <a href="../../../n/j/a/User%7ENja247_5969.html" title="User:Nja247">Nja247</a> (<a href="../../../n/j/a/User_talk%7ENja247_3395.html" title="User talk:Nja247">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nja247_1211.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nja247">contribs</a>) 17:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I use Mac OS X 10.4 for 35 hours a week at work and it's decent, but it's too cartoony looking for me and it doesn't give me enough customization options. What if I don't want cartoony, jelly-like scroll bars or buttons? Too bad, I'm stuck with them. In Windows XP and Vista, which I have at home, I can customize everything to look and act the way I want it to. Also, on the two Mac G5 computers I have at work, the programs crash. It's rare, but it happens. I used to have problems with Windows 95 and Windows 98, but with XP and Vista, I haven't really had any crashes, and I push my home computers the hardest. Finally, what's with Apple charging over $100 for minor updates to OS X (10.2, 10.3, 10.4, etc.)? Microsoft lets users download and install Windows updates for free. 69.203.64.174 22:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's nice. How is this relevant to Boot Camp or anything being discussed on this talk page? As a side note, Windows Vista Ultimate costs $400 per license and many consider Windows XP SP3. In fact, you can take a Windows XP installation and install IE 7, WMP 11, Windows Defender, Google Calendar and Picasa, and something called Vista transformation pack which will give you the "Wow" of Vista for free. Criticise OS X all you wish, but attempting to do so in terms of its pricing when compared to Windows is asisine. Again, I use both OS X and Windows, but Windows is only for gaming - plain and simple, however Vista broke gaming in Windows, albeit temporarily. Oh and OS X gets many updates for free; how else can you explain starting at 10.4.0 and working your way up to 10.4.9? Finally, it was Windows XP which was referred to the Nickelodeon OS by reviewers when it came out -- not OS X. Go figure. <a href="../../../n/j/a/User%7ENja247_5969.html" title="User:Nja247">Nja247</a> (<a href="../../../n/j/a/User_talk%7ENja247_3395.html" title="User talk:Nja247">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nja247_1211.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nja247">contribs</a>) 21:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
