<p>Err... didn't Archbishop Laud draw up the Book of Common Prayer in the reign of Charles I? What's going on here? <a href="../../../j/l/k/User%7EJlk7e_f298.html" title="User:Jlk7e">john</a> 03:12 21 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>There may be a link, though: Cranmer drew heavily on the German Reformed theologian Martin Bucer. I know nothing of the Heidelberg liturgies, but it's plausible that they may have drawn on Bucer. 81.79.144.196 22:20, 3 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the picture of the 1979 US BCP; it doesn't add anything to the article and it is hardly the best choice for the most prominent picture in this article. Surely a better picture would be of the title page of a 1662 Prayer Book.<a href="../../../g/s/t/User%7EGSTQ_b012.html" title="User:GSTQ">GSTQ</a> 05:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>John Wesley did not 'convert'; he simply carried on his preaching and organisation of groups which eventually formed the Methodist Church. Both he and Charles, his brother, died technically as Anglicans. Methodist worship in both the United States and England now use books much influenced by the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical_Movement_fbc4.html" title="Liturgical Movement">Liturgical Movement</a>. The material on the Presbyterian church is about worship books without clear reference to their indebtedness to the BCP. Prebyterians in the UK used the very different 'Book of Common Order' Its relationship to the BCP would need to be demonstrated in detail but in a separate article <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 22:21, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have altered the material for these two for the following reasons. ECUSA existed as a church with a liturgy from 1607 not 1789. The material took no account of the difference between incremental change in the early twentieth century and the considerable changes which took place after WWII when the Liturgical Movement began to make its impact. Whereas in England the government prevented changes which would have put it at the forefront of liturgical development in 1928, these proceeded in the rest of the communion. There should be a section on NZ too, but, liturgically speaking, the new liturgies of the late twentieth century show more evidence of a debt to the Roman Catholic church than they do to Cranmer. I have tried to indicate that the diminution of Cranmer's influence began in 1559 (!) and has proceeded ever since; but the watershed is undoubtedly the 'new liturgies' following Vatican II. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 11:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The treatment of the introduction of the 1979 Prayer Book in the US is very confusing; the changes were more extensive than in previous prayer books, but it is still the Book of Common Prayer in the US, and that's not really all that confusing. It is not a new book given an old name, it is a substantial revision.</p>
<p>There was a claim that the older American prayer books are all canonically authorized. This is not true. Please cite a canon here if you wish to argue otherwise. <a href="../../../t/b/_/User%7ETb_b6f8.html" title="User:Tb">Tb</a> 16:33, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be appropriate for those who defend the 1979 book as being a descendant of the BCP to show this. It owes far more to the liturgical movement and I think it would be hard to refute this. Does Tb know a lot about the history of the BCP and the influence of the liturgical movement? <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 19:54, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having had sight of the 1979 BCP I think that my latest revision is more accurate, but mroe could be done. My apologies to Tb; it is a moot point how much it owes to the English BCP. I think it would be useful for a new article to be produced perhaps with the title of 'Anglican liturgies'. I confess to Tb that I was not aware how conservative the 1979 BCP was in its language. What I would still argue is that Cranmer would have been appalled by it - which is not a criticism of it as liturgy - and that many self-respecting Engolish Anglicans would likewise find it unacceptable. It would never have got through the Church of England General Synod. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 22:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course it wouldn't have. The American church has always been far more Anglo-Catholic in many details, including from the very beginning its use of the Scottish Eucharistic prayer. The US is not Britain: a fact which took George III some trouble to learn, and which +Rowan still seems to have some trouble digesting, and now perhaps you. I would note that the 1979 BCP does *not* represent any change in the observance of saints days over what existed previously in the American church. Talk of a departure "in theology" is nowhere near NPOV, since the position of the American church is that it does not represent any such departure. I see no need for your attempt to lobby pot shots at the 1979 BCP; you seem to want to say it's bad, while not actually being allowed to say *that*. Can we simply try not to pass judgments on it at all? I've made a new change which I think preserves the idea, without trying to diss the book. <a href="../../../t/b/_/User%7ETb_b6f8.html" title="User:Tb">Tb</a> 02:13, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the contrary, my capacity for concealing my own views is obviously better than I thought! I am hugely in favour of the 1979 book. However, the article is about the BCP - that which began in 1549 and ended up as 1662. That the Church in the United States moved away from Cranmer early was not known to me and I did not at first trespass on this section. I attempted to improve it with inadequate knowledge and am glad you have corrected it. However, while I am grateful for the corrections and don't have the material in front of me, I should be surprised if the first (P)ECUSA book of 1789 incorporated the insights of the Liturgical Movement which did not get going until the 20h century. You tell me that the Sanctorale was never lost: I never knew that. I must do some work on the Scottish Episcopal church. However, to repeat: either I have expressed myself very badly or you have jumped to a conclusion that my sympathies lie with Cranmer. I consider him a great stylist and his theology dismays me utterly. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 13:19, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, then all I can say is that I'm sorry, and I'm delighted that I my judgment was a misjudgment. Of course the 1789 book did not incorporate the insights of the liturgical movement; but that doesn't make something radical; the whole point of the liturgical movement was to make plain what had been there all along, if obscured. If "Book of Common Prayer" identifies only an English book, then it does not apply to Scotland, the US, or any of the other provinces which have long not used the English book. In the US, it has long meant the book that is authorized by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church as being such. There may seem to be an abuse of language on that side of the pond that we call our book the "Book of Common Prayer", but we have always done so and aren't about to change. (Now and then people would ask me what the "Alternative Service Book" in England was, and I would reply: It's what they have *instead* of a Book of Common Prayer. I think that the American church, by revising the BCP [whether in little ways or big ones] has kept the spirit far better than those provinces that have more or less moved to storing the BCP on a shelf to be honored but not used, and having some other book for the actual liturgies of the church.) <a href="../../../t/b/_/User%7ETb_b6f8.html" title="User:Tb">Tb</a> 15:03, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tb and I have had a considerable debate on our own pages about this section. In particular there are issues, which editors might regard as not necessary in this article, about the disputes wshich took place between Seabury's consecration in 1784 and the publication of the 1790 US Prayer book, My concern is that just as the prayer book was at the centre of storms blown by liberals and conservatives (to use untechnical terms) in England, so between those dates there were those who wanted to keep the prayer book unchanged apart from the necessary removal of references to the English monarch; there were those who wanted to remove or alter much material (rewriting the psalms, removing the Athanasian Creed, altering words in the other Creeds and removing reference to them in the Communion Service) and there were those who wanted to import 'catholicising' elements form the Scottish liturgy and, with the encouragement of Seabury not to approve what was not approved by episcopal authority. This is of course an article about the BCP not about the history the of (P)ECUSA. I hope we have got the balance right. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_Arguile_a33f.html" title="User:Roger Arguile">Roger Arguile</a> 19:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where does the ubiquitous 'Till death do us part' come from?
