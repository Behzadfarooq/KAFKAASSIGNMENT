<p>Hey everyone! I just wanted to have a discussion on the upcoming book. So, Christopher Paolini has stated that a dead character is going to "rise" up. Who could this be? Is it a good guy or a bad guy? How about Brom, Garrow, a person from Carvahall, or some other person? What do other people think? *Why does everyone think Orik might be a rider? Read my edit (hopefully not over-edited). If it was erased, it was said during Eragon's training that humans, dragons, and elves share a bond through magic, and that dwarves weren't included.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I think the reason why everyone thinks that Orik will be a rider is because he is the only character who is not already a rider that talks to Saphira like an individual. Although, I agree that Orik will not be the next rider. I think that Orik will become king of the dwarves. If this happens, and Arya becomes queen of the elves, then Eragon will be the person who connects the races. There will be harmony in the land, and then Eragon can leave. This is my theory, but I'm not basing that on anything. What do you or others think?</li>
<li>Orik cannot be the next rider, nor will any dwarf......as it is stated that dwarves do not share the connection with dragons that elves and humans share. Now with him being king and all....in ELDEST when hrothgar is killed and is being mourned orik says-"now the leaders of the clans will gather together and choose a new king from among THEM" now if he is refering to the dwarf clan leaders......then orik cant be the next king because he isn't a clan leader. Although after that he also says that hrothgar made him his heir. If this is a monoarchy like a humans well....then he will be king.
<ul>
<li>First of all, if you look at the <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not</a> page, you will clearly see that Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a "crystal ball," i.e., it's not a place for unverifiable speculation. This means that the majority of the article should be removed. Secondly, speaking of removing content, you might not be very familiar with what happens when an edit is made. Wikipedia's servers store a copy of the article every time an edit is made. In response to your concern about being "overedited", you could have included a link to the differences page (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empire_%28Inheritance_trilogy%29&amp;diff=30856599&amp;oldid=30176045" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empire_%28Inheritance_trilogy%29&amp;diff=30856599&amp;oldid=30176045" rel="nofollow">this</a>) to show everyone the changes you made. Finally, an formal decision has been made on many pages (for example, <a href="../../../e/p/i/Talk%7EEpisodes_of_Lost_%28Season_2%29_dd89.html" title="Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)">Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)</a>) that Wikipedia is not a fansite. This is not a Wikipedia policy for all articles, but it definitely deserves to be. Neither the article on Empire nor it's talk page should be used as a "fan site" for discussion about the book. All of that should be conducted on fan sites. For a list of fan sites, please see the article on <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html#External_links" title="Eragon">Eragon</a>.

<li>However, almost all of the people who come to this article look for speculation and rumours for what could happen. Anyways, this article is 'crystal ball' speculation, whatever it contains, because this article contains info prior to its release. Moreover, you may have seen the article Prior speculation on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. How come that is still kept, event though it's blatant speculation, none of which was confirmable prior to it's release. Also, there is a section of speculation in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Harry_Potter%7E_Book_Seven_08de.html" title="Harry Potter: Book Seven">Harry Potter: Book Seven</a> which is tagged with {{<a href="../../../o/r/i/Template%7EOriginalResearch_5c79.html" title="Template:OriginalResearch">OriginalResearch</a>}}. Maybe we could do the same here. So, even though I won't restore the speculation till I hear your response, I feel the speculation is an important, and frankly, the only notable part of the article even though it goes against <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. But for archival purposes, I am adding this link to let all people who wish to see the speculation:</li>

<p>I'm very sorry this is not warranted usage of this space, but I just wanted to tell you peeps that I am creating a fourm at <a href="http://s10.invisionfree.com/InheritanceTrilogy/" class="external free" title="http://s10.invisionfree.com/InheritanceTrilogy/" rel="nofollow">http://s10.invisionfree.com/InheritanceTrilogy/</a> so that any and all SPECULATION can be fourmized....................:P but it is not complete, i will inform you when it is......DR7</p>

<li>I want to know something. Why is a whole bunch of information deleted from this site? Even the confirmed details were deleted! Is there a reason why all the questions are unfit to be on this site? Why are some examples of speculation not allowed, but others are? What is going on? I don't want to change anything back because I am not sure about the "rules" that were violated, and some new information was added that I don't want to delete. Please explain what and why this all happened. I am completely confused and outraged at the same time, for over half of the article is suddenly gone. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Canadian_9f21.html" title="User:Evil Canadian">Evil Canadian</a></li>

<li>I want to know why a lot of people think that Selena was "loose". How many guys did this woman have kids with? Morzan, Brom, and Ajahad are just a few names that this woman has supposed to have had children for. I will be supremely supprised if this is how Paolini depicts the mother of the protagonist of this epic. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Canadian_9f21.html" title="User:Evil Canadian">Evil Canadian</a> 23:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>THis article should not be named empire yet. It should be reverted to "book 3(untitled)" for it is <i>likley</i> to be named that, not that it <i>is</i> As always, <i>speculation</i> should be on the discusion page, and <i>not</i> on the article page. Please revert back to that title. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_pointer_outer_dd90.html" title="User:The pointer outer">The pointer outer</a> 20:18, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To The Pointer Outer,</li>
</ul>
<p>First, the door is to the left, and secondly, if the main article does not have speculation on it, then their would be nothing on it because the book is not out yet. And thirdly, I like the name Empire and it should be titled Empire instead of lousy book three. The page discussion should be for this kind of stuff, stuff that does not make sense, stuff that needs explaining, pr stuff that should be argued about. -Chris P.</p>
<ul>
<li>About the theories of Brom's sword being under the Menoa tree: sorry to break it to you, but Brom's sword has been distroyed. Rhunon told Eragon that the Forsworn had distroyed all the Riders' swords. Even though she was surprised to see Zar'roc, it does not give hope that maybe she was mistaken on Broms sword also. Brom had gone to Rhunon and asked her to replace his lost sword. Since his sword has been lost, and "lost" is another word for "nevermore," it is logical that Broms sword had been distroyed. It is gone and it is not underneath the Menoa Tree.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sorry to break it to you too, but it was stated in Eldest that all but TWO swords were destroyed and were held by the two oldest elven families in Du Weldenvarden. That was why Rhunon was surprised to see Zar'roc. So when Brom said his sword was lost, he could have meant it literally- somewhere unknown. And i don't think it was literally under the tree either. The two oldest elven families, Brom's old sword, and plus, the Menoa tree was originally a girl, and she was around before the elves became immortal so she is very old, too. K.G.</li>

<p>I know what evil Canadian means!I had a friend over the day before it was moved and we were going to study it the next day.68.196.121.7 11:06, 9 April 2006 (UTC)Lalalalad</p>
<p>I think the dead rise up means that guy, whats-his-face, Murtagh's teacher (Tornac)</p>
<p>I was looking through Eragon yesterday, and i found out that selena died. Murtagh was telling Eragon that when news reached him that Morzan was killed, Selena came back after being gone for many months. She was very sick and within a fortnight, she died. And then in Eldest, we find out that Selena was also Murtagh's mother. This also means whoever Eragon's father actually is, is dead. Personally, i think it's Brom and he died as we all know. i also did some calculations with my friend, and we realized murtagh's age is only about 18 because he said to eragon that he escaped at his last birthday when he turned 18. That means morzan was killed 15 years ago because Murtagh got his scar from Morzan when he was 3. So when you think about it, Brom came to Carvahall 15 years ago, Eragon was born 15 years ago, and after morzan died, Selena returned to Murtagh and she died. many events happened at that time and that is one reason i think borm is eragon's father.

<p>The rumors on the article page make things messy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Important things that people have over looked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selena, Eragon and Murtagh's mother, talked to Solumbum. She was also one of the three people that Angela told their fortune too. This could be significant, because as of now we still don't know that much about Selena. People also overlook what Eragon represents in contrast to Murtagh and Galbatorix. Eragon represents all of the fallen Dragon Riders. He has, without intention, borrowed from many of the improtant riders of the past. He has the original rider's name, Eragon. He also has a dragon named after Brom's old dragon and for the majority of books one and two he used Mrozan's sword. He uses Oromis's and Gleadr's training and as a result he represents the Riders as a whole. He also represents a connection between all of the races. He is a human (and part elf thanks to the Dragons), trained by the elves and bound by their magic, and part of the Dwarven clan of Orik. These facts are going to be very important in the upcoming conclusion to the story!</p>
<p>Incidentally, I was given to believe that the gift under the menoa tree was the elven powers granted to Eragon by the dragon dancers. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnand_Karia_e4e9.html" title="User:Anand Karia">Anand</a> 23:32, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Moved from article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roran will be the third dragon rider because Eragon is in the middle,Murtagh is the Eldest and</li>
</ul>
<p>as Roran and Eragon are distant relatives they all might possess royal blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>correction-eragons the youngest and roran would be in the middle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eragon and Roran will kill the Ra'zac.(Arya might help out)</li>
<li>The next Rider may be Arya, and her dragon (likely green) may become Saphira's mate. This may create the additional impetus necessary for Eragon and Arya to become romantically involved as well.</li>
<li>Eragon's lost sword may be replaced by Brom's old Rider sword</li>
</ul>
<p>IT CAN'T BE BROM'S SWORD BECAUSE HIS SWORD WAS DEYSTROYED!!!!!! (Telioty)</p>
<p>OK, In the books, it NEVER said Brom's sword was destroyed. Brom said it was LOST! Meaning a lot more than just possibly DESTRYOED!!! Many things can be interpreted from this saying of "LOST" wiht no explanation.</p>
<p>i think brom "lost" it because he had a vision or something and he saw that someone in the future would need the weapon so he put it somewhere for safe keeping until it was needed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>We may find out about the one who cannot lie, and he may tell Eragon his true name</li>
<li>The weapon under the Menoa Tree might be the first Eragon's sword</li>
<li>Eragon may learn the forbidden secrets of how Galbatorix grows stronger</li>
<li>Oromis (a.k.a. Togira Ikonoka) may die.</li>
<li>We may see Vroengard, which is possibly the location of the Vault Of Souls</li>
<li>The Quote that follows tells how Eragon and Murtagh are indeed brothers, however, one might be one means that one is more like the father, the other line states that one might be two which is the mother</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>While two may share two,<br />
And one of two is certainly one,<br />
One might be two.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Roran may be the logical successor to Galbatorix, as he and Eragon may possess the "royal blood" that still flows in Palancar Valley. It is noted in the books how Eragon and Roran are different from the other people in Carvahall.</li>
<li>In Eragon's first premonition in <i>Eragon</i>: Deathwatch, the two people walking arm in arm are Eragon and Arya, and the man on the beach is either Galbatorix, Roran, Murtagh, or Oromis.</li>
<li>The Vault Of Souls was, according to Solembum, to be used by Eragon when he was in need of great power. We have yet to see how this is achieved.</li>
<li>The two dragons circling in the chapter "Deathwatch" could be Saphira and the third Green dragon who could become Arya's.</li>
<li>The dream Eragon has in "Deathwatch" could be of him and Arya leaving the land Alagesia forever.</li>
<li>Elva will play a much larger role in Book 3.</li>
<li>Nasuada may be Eragon's half-sister because Ajahad is her father, but no one knows who her mother is and Selena might have been pregnant with Nasuada before she had Eragon making Murtagh the Eldest, Nasuada the middle, and Eragon the youngest.</li>
<li>Brom is the most logical person who will rise again considering that the Inheritance Trilogy is very similar to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Brom could be compared with the wizard Gandalf, who comes back in the second book of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy as as an empowered leader. Brom probably will come back to life (maybe by the vault of souls) to help out Eragon, as Gandalf came back to live to help out his comrades.</li>
<li>Linnea(the menoa tree) could be the one to rise again, she was around when the elves were still young and she might have met the grey folk and learned the name of the ancient language, thus being able to help destroy galbatorix.</li>
<li>Both Eragon and Murtagh are the sons of Morzan, who was a powerful, albeit evil, Dragon Rider. Dragons chose to hatch for both the sons, and now they have become Riders. It therefore makes sense if the third Rider for whom the last (and presumably green) dragon will hatch will be the descendant of a Rider. The only old Dragon Riders we know are the king, Morzan, Brom and Oromis, and apart from Morzan it is not known if any of the others had children. The last Rider may be an entirely new character if it follows the pattern of Morzan's sons, or it may be an existing character with no blood ties to the old order of Riders.</li>
<li>Roran will become King of Men. This might be true especially if he is a descendant of King Palancar.</li>
<li>Orik will become King of the Dwarves, as he was adopted by the late dwarf king Hrothgar.</li>
<li>Arya will become Queen of the Elves, as the only heir of Queen Islanzadi.</li>
<li>Nar Garzhvog will become the King of the Urgals.</li>
<li>We shall also see a lot more of Arya's earlier life and will understand why she secludes herself ,and behaves in such a haughty manner.</li>
<li>Brom could be the one to come back because Saphira used dragon magic to transform his tomb. That magic, or maybe magic that happens later at the tomb, could resurrect him, as dragon magic is unpredictable.</li>
<li>There are rumoured to still be dragons in Alagaësia. They could be hiding in the spine.</li>
<li>in death watch two persons are eragon and arya going back to the ship 'dragon wings' towards VROENGARD and the person watching is roran.</li>
<li>Faolin may have been Arya's love. This may be why she is so secluded. She refuses to answer Eragon when pushed on this matter.</li>
<li>Eragon may become the Dwarf Clan Leader, as he is King Hrothgar's adopted son. This may cause tension between Eragon and Orik</li>
<li>Orik may also claim the dwarven throne, as he was adopted before Eragon</li>
<li>Eragon removes the missaid blessing</li>
<li>The elves attack the empire</li>
</ul>
<p><i>"*The weapon under the Menoa Tree might be the first Eragon's sword"</i></p>
<p>This may be true since we dont have an exact time line and it is highly possible that since the first Eragon bonded with a Wild Dragon he may have powers beyond that of those who's dragons hatched from those made after the Elves and Dragons ended their war (Urbanninja3)</p>
<p>The Quote <i>"While two may share two, And one of two is certainly one, One might be two."</i> could be seen as "While two may share two &lt;Farthers&gt; ,And one&lt;Child&gt; of two&lt;fathers&gt;is certainly one&lt;Mother&gt;,One&lt;Mother&gt; might be two&lt;sons&gt;". this sujests that even though Eragon and Murtagh share the same mother Eragon may have a different Father who could be Brom.</p>
<p>Elva who in the second book had aged very fast since Eragon's curse may have matured into an adult by book 3 when Eragon breaks the curse. however we do not know what Saphira's blessing may cause this could mean she is intended for the third and final egg having been marked by a dragon this could me that Elva (a matured adult) is the one who becomes involved with Eragon as the two Dragons mate. She may also be the key to the vault of souls because it is said she may play a greater role in the 3rd book (Urbanninja3)</p>

<p>I think this theory makes a lot of sense, as Roran is an even better leader than Eragon - on par with Nasuada, I should say. He's matured a lot, he is intelligent, loyal and brave, and he vows to avenge his father's death. Also, the idea of a family of Riders sounds like something an author would like, especially if Eragon and Arya marry, and their child becomes a Rider. Eragon's child would have such a history: father, grandfather, uncle and father's cousin all Riders, the mother a <i>princess and the grandmother a queen</i>. There is also a suggestion that Roran and Eragon are descendants of King Palancar through Selena and Garrow and Eragon's biological father was royalty among the Riders, which is heady stuff. Paolini definitely puts a lot emphasis on lineage in his books, and I think that this is a concept that would appeal to him when taken in the context of the books. I would really prefer Elva to become a Rider, but I somehow feel that Roran has better chances - better than even Arya, maybe. - Jessix, March 26th 2006 I just want to add something to your theory,Jessix.Evandar was killed at Illirea so could he have been a rider?```` Lalalalad [Evandar went out with the Elven army as their leader, their king]</p>
<p>However, if Roran is to have the bloodline of King Palancer, then he might be king of men. As said in the book, no one man should rule forever and if Roran is a dragon rider, then he would rule forever. Surely that was said for a reason, other than to help the conglict against Galbatorix.</p>
<p>Yes, having Roran as a rider does have a nice ring to it, but one must consider the book itself. In order for Roran to become the rider and a good plot to emerge, the last egg has to be obtained, it has to hatch for Roran, and <b>Roran has to be trained!!!</b> The time in the book would be a huge amount of time. Unless Eragon goes away for a year or so while Roran is being trained, the third book will be too much like the first one. There cannot be another "introduction to the Riders" section because Paolini is a better author than that. Also, there cannot be a sentence like "Many months went by while Eragon and Saphira trained Roran and his dragon." Paolini is too good an author to allow this to happen, and he cannot write a Roran version of Eragon (the book), for it would be boring, useless, and long. So, even though having Roran as a rider would bring closure to this special family, it does not make sense with Paolini's writing style and his choices for content. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Canadian_9f21.html" title="User:Evil Canadian">Evil Canadian</a> 03:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC) but what if he didn't have to train?(just asking)Lalalalad</p>
<p>Having Roran be the third rider does make a lot of sense, many could come to that conclusion. However, the one thing people over look is how Roran is related to Eragon, through Eragon's mother not Morzan. Therefore, Roran would not have the same bloodline that both Eragon and Murtagh have, which in turn may have been a factor in the dragons choosing them.</p>
<p>I don't think Roran should be the next Rider. He'd have to be trained. That would make the book way too long! Also I thnk that Nasuada will become the next rider. Paolini said that the next rider will be a bit of a surprise and Nasuada is possibly Eragon and Mutagh's sister. Also, I believe that the person standing on the beach(Eragon:Deathwatch)is Eragon whilst Roran and Arya walk hand in hand. This thereby(assuming Roran becomes King and Arya becomes Queen of their respective races)would unite the races of Alagaesia. Meanwhile neither is a Rider and Nasuada's dragon is female thereby making Thorne Saphira's mate and turning Murtagh good(he'll either turn good after Galbatorix is dead or during the "final battle"... please gimme some feedback on this extra bit. WRITTEN BY: A HUGE INHERITANCE TRILOGY FAN. &lt;One little thing: the last egg is a male. Just to let you know:)&gt;</p>
<p>I acctually do think that is extreamely possible, you summed it up so fast though, but it all made sense, I do think that your theory is something to think about, but why would Arya and Roran marrie, at least Eragon and her have somwhaat of a history. And besides, It would make more sense if Arya married another Elf. Also, not that I don't think it will happen, just that i think that Murtaugh and Eragon might not reunite, because Paolini also said that Galbatorix sealed his bond tight with Murtaugh, so another possibility is that the shred of love Murtaugh still has for Eragon might make him save Eragon in the last battle, therefor dying himself. Remember these are just theorys, so "A HUGE INHERITANCE FAN", punch in some more if I didn't get what you were trying to say. -vince.sg</p>
<p>Actually,roran just might be the rider.After all,he is going to Galbatorix's castle.What could happen is just that he and eragonould sneak in,but are broken up.Roran could stumble into where galbatorix is hidong the unhatched dragon egg.He would touch it and voila!But there also is the possibility that he encounters galbatorix and the king would convince him to stay with him for katrina.</p>
<p>i dont think that roran will be the next rider actually. he seems kind of blind to some things and out of it. Besides you would need someone who already knew something about dragons and magic because they cant waste a lot of time training someone totally oblivious to this concept and who only learned that they existed a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p><br />
In the Limited Edition of Eldest, there is the third chapter of the third book. In it, Eragon and Saphira are by themselves,and they reach Helgrind, and something happens to Eragon...then it ends. we also know that Roran was going with Eragon to Helgrind, not Galbatorix, to catch the Ra'zac. So this means that something happened to Roran or he didn't go. I don't agree though, it would him as rider.</p>

<li>they know a lot more about the ancient language than a lot of people so they might know a way to do that</li>

<li>What is the exact nature of Dras-Leona's religion

<li>It's possible that the people of Dras-Leona worship the Ra'zac, as the give up parts of their body to Helgrind, where the Ra'zac live, and the Ra'zac have been revealed as eating humans.

<li>What the weapon is underneath the Menoa Tree and where and what the Rock of Kuthian and the Vault of Souls is</li>

<li>i think the vault of souls might be at helgrind, why else would there be two deadly creatures that guard it so carefully.</li>
<li>the weapon under the menoa tree isnt really under the tree its with one of the two families
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>you see roots doesnt just have to mean the roots of a tree it could also mean where you came from, like your origin which would be your family. so if you traced linneas roots back to her mother and father and then back to there parents you would get two families. with that being said since there are two families there might be two weapons but its a matter of eragon finding the right one. one of the weapons could very well be broms sword since it never said it was destroyed, just "lost." the second weapon could be the firsts eragons sword or something else.</li>

<p>A note inferred from Eragon: Roran has a polished rock. Could it be a fourth dragon egg? Paolini would not mention it without purpose. I think this was more Roran forgeting Eragon and Eragon feeling hurt, because of similar objects, this is pretty ironic, but I don't think it was done on purpose, and It seems a very unlikely thing to happen, especially since it was left there and Carvahall is now destroyed.</p>

<p>This is complete speculation, but I have to write it down and have it criticized. The Grey Folk were the race who created the Ancient Language. Therefore, they must know the name of it. If Eragon was to meet a Grey Folk, he could learn this word and have control over all who use the language. This is all the magic users in Alagaesia, including King Galbatorix. Now, about the Menoa tree. The Menoa Tree is really the elf Linnea. She lived in a time <b>before</b> he elves were immortal. Oromis had said to Eragon that the Grey Folk were around when the elves were a young race. Since the elves have been immortal for a great span of years, wouldn't that make Linnea part of this young race? Is it possible that the Menoa Treen is old enough to have met a Grey Folk and have learned the name of the Ancient Language? Could that possibly be the weapon found under the Menoa tree? --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Canadian_9f21.html" title="User:Evil Canadian">Evil Canadian</a> 03:39, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe linnea will be the soul that is brought back to life since she wasnt actually killed she just turned herself into a tree. Its just like shes trapped in a cage and if they can find a way to unlock it they bring her back to life. <i>She</i> would be the weapon under the menoa tree and if she had met the grey folk and new the name of the ancient language she could help destroy galbatorix.</p>

<p>DR7&gt;.&lt; OK, first of all, your right about the rock being left behind, but i think that the "rock" was nothing but that, a rock. and as for it being destroyed, it also said that the eggs were very strong and hard, so i doubt that the smashing of the house would destroy a egg. and if you are right and it was a dragon egg, how can roran become the next rider if it was destroyed?????? DR7&gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Wait, that doesn't mean that Roran can't be the next Dragon rider. It was just a freaking worthless polished rock, the dragon egg is still in a different possession, so he could still be the next dragon rider, we have yet to find out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the page reference! It's so not a dragon egg.</p>
<ol>
<li>If Eragon could find it, Galbatorix could. Moreover, Galbatorix would have known if there was a fourth egg to begin with.</li>
<li>It should have resembled Saphira's egg, which would have made Roran try to sell it (thus bringing it to everyone's attention so when Saphira's egg appeared they'd see the resemblance), or which would've meant that Roran at least would have recognized Saphira's egg.</li>
<li>If Roran's meant to be a Rider, the rock/egg would have hatched long ago.</li>

<p>And, he could bounce it in his hand for crying out loud! Unless the dragon inside will only be about 4 <i>high when it's fully grown, then it is</i> <b>not</b> <i>a dragon egg.</i> Also, I think the only significance of the rock was to show that Roran was trying to leave things that would bring back memories of either Eragon or Carvahall, for some reason. --<a href="../../../%CF%89/_/_/User%7E%CE%A9_37a1.html" title="User:Ω">Ω</a> 13:39, 16 April 2006 (UTC) But remember two things:one,that Paolini never mentioned the size of the rock and 2:he didn't mention if Roran slept with it.68.196.121.7 19:18, 6 May 2006 (UTC)lalalad</p>
<p>DR7&gt;.&lt; First of all, Roran will not become a rider, this is because he may be royal blood, but that would only make him king of the land.. secound of all his "polished rock" is not described in any way, shape or form like the dragon eggs.. and his egg would have already hatched because of the presence of another dragon.... so roran is not the next rider. As for arya, there is a better chance of that because of the magic thing. and maybe the elf who fought Eragon in Elsmeria could become the next rider. i personally think that Brom should come back and take the position.. but he is dead and unless Eragon can call his soul back from within the valt of souls, that will never happen.. DR7</p>
<p>If this "rock" or "egg" was a dragon egg then when Eragon's egg hatched he would have relized that Roran's rock was a dragon egg. He would not just leave it there if it was. Now who has a better answer than that?</p>
<p>i agree, good point but back to what the person before you said about aryas magic. it was said that your magic is the color of your dragon but you can change the color but that would require you to have or have had a dragon. So Arya might have had a dragon in the past. But elves already have magic so it could have just been green to begin with for no specific reason at all.</p>

<p>I would say that this article differs from the Harry Potter articles for a number of reasons. This is filled with suggestions and ideas from fans, not with actual known facts about the next novel (see Prior speculation on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.) However, I believe that this style of writing provides some valid ideas about the next book. The article requires editing for consistency and style, and I am prepared to continue doing this, but it requires a lot of work. I have added a clean-up template to bring in outside help. However, there is one section that I do not believe adds to the speculation: comparisons between Inheritance and Star Wars and LotR. I feel we should delete this.

<p>I just came up with a possible solution for all the speculation.

<dl>
<dd>We could create a sub-page of the article. However, a simple page move might be more effective. The only problem is, there would be very little left on this page. If we include a <b>Known Facts</b> section at the top of this page, perhaps including interviews with Paolini and other related text, whilst keeping the speculation at the bottom, I think it is fine as it is. The current article is conspicuously lacking in actual, citable fact. Another problem that I have seen is the lack of order and structure to the article: "Unconfirmed Rumours" and "Speculation" are in essence the same section. I therefore propose:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>A new section called <b>Known Facts</b>, which would include definite, citable information</li>
<li>A replacement of the old sections with <b>Speculation</b>, preferably with all new additions at least mentioned on this talk page first</li>
<li>A major revamp of the speculation section's content (I have already tried to start this), removing sections that repeat themselves, cleaning up, using subheadings, &amp;c.</li>
</ol>

<p>An anonymous user stated under the speculation heading that, "In order to kill Galbatorix, Eragon may need to kill himself."

<dt>Concerning How a Person Is Chosen To Be a Rider</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is commonly thought that a person's parentage affects their chances of becoming a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Rider</a>. However, many, or even most, of the Riders had might not have Riders for parents. Probably the best reason is that it still depends upon a dragon in its egg to choose any given person as its Rider. Hence there exists no absolute chance of the above being true. This idea may have taken root from the fact that both Morzan's known sons became Riders.</li>
<li>Paolini confirmed in a March 2006 interview that when a dragon and Rider become linked, the Rider's magic immediately takes on the color of the dragon's scales. However, this does not mean that if you are a magic user born with green energy, you cannot be paired with an amethyst-colored dragon, for example. On being linked, your magic will automatically change from green to purple - although you can change colors at your will. Paolini states that although Eragon's magic is blue, he could produce red fire if he wanted to. So far, however, Riders have chosen to use the automatic color - their dragon's color. Oromis uses gold magic, Murtagh's energy is ruby-red, and Eragon's is bright blue. <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shruikan.html" title="Shruikan">Shruikan</a> is black, although the dragon that actually chose Galbatorix might have been another color; the union between Galbatorix and Shruikan isn't a true dragon-Rider union, so Galbatorix's automatic color may still be that of his original dragon, though he may have chosen to change it after so many decades.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning Isidar Mithrim, the Star Sapphire</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It has been suggested by unconfirmed sources allegedly "close to Paolini" that Eragon and Saphira will mend the star sapphire. This will give it the ability to hold massive amounts of magical energy, perhaps giving Eragon the strength to kill Galbatorix.</li>
</ul>
<p>DR7 &gt;.&lt; Ah, perhaps the final battle between Eragon and Galbatorix will take place on the newly repaird sapphire and Eragon will draw power from the power it took to repair it in some way... and with that new power end the evil kings life and rule....DR7 &gt;.&lt;</p>
<ul>
<li>it could be his true name because i dont think brom ever told eragon what they meant, so it could be and he just doesnt know it and thats why he was able to lie to durza.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning the words Brom told Eragon before he died</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The words may be the name of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_language.html" title="Ancient language">ancient language</a></li>
<li>The words COULD NOT be Eragon's true name, because after Brom's death, Eragon thinks to himself that he could not tell Durza his true name because he "Does not know it himself."</li>
</ul>
<pre>
   it could have been his true name or at least part of them but he might not know because brom didnt tell him what the words were.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The words may be Galbatorix's true name</li>
<li>The words may be the spell that nearly destroyed life on Alageasia once.</li>
<li>The words may be the way to draw energy straight from light, fire, etc.</li>
<li>The words may be Brom telling Eragon that he is his father. &lt;If they where then why did Eragon believe Murtagh when he said that Eragons father was the leader of the forsworn? --82.5.75.13 21:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)&gt;</li>
<li>The words may be Brom's ressurection spell</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning the next Rider</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Both Eragon and Murtagh are the sons of Morzan, who was a powerful, albeit evil, Dragon Rider. Dragons chose to hatch for both the sons, and now they have both become Riders. It therefore makes sense if the third Rider for whom the last dragon will hatch will be the descendant of a Rider. The only old Dragon Riders we know are Galbatorix, Morzan, Vrael, Brom and Oromis, and apart from Morzan it is not known if any of the others had children. The last Rider may be an entirely new character, or a character that has already appeared in the first two books.</li>
<li>The next Rider may be <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Dr%C3%B6ttningu_c465.html" title="Arya Dröttningu">Arya Dröttningu</a>, and her dragon may become Saphira's mate. This may create the additional impetus necessary for Eragon and Arya to become romantically involved as well. Arya is also of royal blood and Angela predicted that Eragon would love someone of noble birth. However, this is thought unlikely because Arya has three times rejected Eragon's attempts to court her. Some argue that she will be chosen because her magic is green. However, the revelation made by Paolini in the March 2006 interview (over live chat) means that Arya may not necessarily become the next Rider just because her magic is green - another may be chosen, and their energy would then automatically give green magic. Proponents of the Arya theory also argue that she has green eyes, although the significance of this is debatable. Another reason why she may become the next Rider is that she is a complete Mary Sue.</li>
<li>Roran is a likely candidate, as he shows leadership abilities and is the cousin of a Rider - this would make a family of Riders: Morzan, his sons Eragon and Murtagh, and their cousin Roran. It is likely that Nasuada, Murtagh, Eragon, Arya and Roran will be the main leaders in the war (apart from the reigning royals Islanzadi, Galbatorix, Orrin and Hrothgar's likely successor Orik), and it is therefore suitable that Roran's power is enhanced by a link to a dragon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next rider could be roran because when he and eragon go to helgrind the egg might be there because Galby thought the Ra'zac could protect it better than anyone else. That would make it possible for roran to get the egg when they rescue Katrina. DR7 &gt;.&lt; Do you honestly think that Galbatorix would trust the third egg to them????? Come on....DR7 &gt;.&lt;</li>
<li>The next Rider could be <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasuada.html" title="Nasuada">Nasuada</a>, as of the fact that she is leader of the Varden and a formidable force in her own right, and her dragon and Saphira may mate. This would also give her long life, which would make a sexuemotional relationship with <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtagh.html" title="Murtagh">Murtagh</a>-- or even Eragon-- possible.</li>
<li>Elva may become the next Rider, as she will obviously play a major role in "Empire" although we have yet to see what that role may be. She also has the mark of the dragons on her forehead, which could connect her to dragons in some special way.</li>
<li>The next Rider may be Katrina. If Galbatorix moved the eggs for safety after Saphira's was taken, he may have entrusted them to the Ra'zac, his powerful and loyal servants, in Helgrind, an impenitrable fortress for all but those with wings. Murtagh may have been taken to the eggs or the eggs taken to him for testing when Thorn hatched. Katrina is also in Helgrind. It would be possible that she makes contact with the egg and it hatches for her. This would explain Eragon's 'Deathwatch' vision, the male and female boarding a boat, two dragons overhead, and a man crying out in anguish. If the man is Roran, it would make sense that he cries for the love that is being taken from him.</li>
<li>The next Rider may be a female elf to keep the balance, as both Eragon and Murtagh are male humans.</li>
<li>It is also possible the Vanir may be the next Rider since Eragon said that any of the elves, even Vanir, would make a better Rider than him.</li>
<li>The next rider may be Eragon and Murtagh's brother/sister. (See below in "Other") If the second book is titled "Eldest", and we look at the proper mechanics of english, then there must be at least 3 siblings. Eldest is a superlative adjective and must refer to one out of a group of 3 or more. If there were only two brothers the author would use the comparative form, "Elder." Murtagh says that Zar'roc should have gone to Morzan's "Eldest son, not his youngest." This means that there are at least three children in the family, with Murtagh being the oldest and Eragon younger than Murtagh the next sibling may be older or younger than Eragon. So even though there has been no hinting that there is another sibling it is very likely that a third sibling will be the next rider. It might even be Nasuada herself because both her and Eragon's mother left them when they were young.</li>
<li>If the new rider is Eragon and Murtagh's brother/sister then the chance is Galbatorix may persuade him/her to join forces with him</li>
<li>It could be possible that this is Nasuada, whose mother died is the final rider, the quote of the Raven could also pertain to her all her mother is the same as Eragon's all three Eragon, Murtagh and Nasuada would be half-siblings and she could possibly be the final rider.</li>
<li>The chances of Arya being the next rider are good. She is a female elf, which would create more of a balance among the riders. And it would ease some of the tensions between the elves and the varden because they feel as though elves are better suited to be riders so are a bit upset about two new human riders. As mentioned above it would take too much time for training a new rider, unless the new rider already has proper training, which Arya has, which would make her a perfect candidate. Arya is on the "good side" as is Eragon, therefore their dragons would be possible mates.</li>

<dt>Concerning the third dragon</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The green dragon egg contains a male, as confirmed by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtagh.html" title="Murtagh">Murtagh</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldest.html" title="Eldest">Eldest</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>The third dragon may mate with Saphira and produce another offspring.</li>
<li>Murtagh might try to protect the Varden by giving them the third egg, thereby allowing the next Rider to be chosen from within the Varden's ranks.</li>
<li>Christopher Paolini has confirmed that the third dragon will be green and will be featured on the cover on his next book (Jan. 2006). <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning Eragon's new weapon</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Eragon's lost sword may be replaced by the weapon under the roots of the Menoa tree.</li>
<li>The weapon under the Menoa Tree might be the original Eragon's sword. This sword may be set with sapphires. It may once have been Brom's sword before his Saphira's death. Brom obviously lost the sword at some point, because in Carvahall the only Rider sword he had belonged to Morzan.</li>
<li>What if Solumbum, when he said 'roots', meant origin (which is a definition of root), and Eragon would have to go to one of the oldest elven families (possibly related to the person who sang herself into the menoa tree, whatever her name was) to get a sword (remember, someone said that if there were any remaining Rider swords, they would be protected by elven families). Maybe Brom's old sword? He lost it, remember?</li>
<li>The Dwarfs and Elves may work together to make Eragon a new sword matching Saphira's scales.</li>
<li>The Weapon might have been the "gift of dragons, Eragon's new guise in 'Eldest"</li>
<li>Oromis might give Eragon Naegling (the gold sword the elves made <i>him</i>) before he dies (it is not confirmed wheather Oromis &amp; Glaedr die but it is possible).</li>
<li>It is possible that since there are 2 swords other than Naegling. One of them could be blue and Eragon could inherit that sword. That sword could also be Brom's who could possibly be Eragon's relative (such as a grandfather).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning the Quote of the Raven, Bladgen</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Interpreted to mean Eragon and Murtagh are indeed half-brothers</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>While two &lt;Children&gt; may share two &lt;Parents&gt;</i></dd>
<dd><i>And one &lt;Child&gt; of two &lt;Parents&gt; is certainly one</i></dd>
<dd><i>One &lt;Mother&gt; might be &lt;Mother to&gt; two &lt;Children of different Fathers&gt;.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So this may mean that Eragon's Mother, after leaving Morzan, had a relationship with Brom and Eragon is Brom's son. <i>Alternatively, it could refer to Eragon's own rationalization of his upbringing:</i></p>
<p>"While two &lt;sons&gt; may share two &lt;parents&gt; And one &lt;parent&gt; of two &lt;parents&gt; is certainly one, One &lt;role&gt; might be &lt;held by&gt; two &lt;people&gt;".</p>
<p>This reflects how Eragon chose to think of Morzan only as his sire, whereas it was Garrow (Morzan's brother-in-law) who raised Eragon, fulfilling the social role of a father.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning the Vault of Souls</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Vault of Souls was, according to Solembum, to be used by Eragon when he was in need of great power. We have yet to see how this is achieved. It could be similar to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a> (in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Return_of_the_King_b1c6.html" title="The Return of the King">The Return of the King</a>), where he enters the "Paths of the Dead" and bind the souls to help him fight the forces of evil.</li>
<li>Perhaps when Eragon yells his name into the vault of souls he will be able to contact Brom's spirit, and Brom will tell him the he is not Morzan's Son, but his own, thus empowering Eragon and relieving him of his dark lineage.</li>
<li>Maybe a group of Dragons will re-emerge in Alagäesia from the Vault of Souls and join forces with the elves, dwarfs and humans in battle.</li>
<li>We may see Vroengard, which could be the location of the Vault of Souls</li>
<li>It is possible that Helgrind is also the Vault of Souls.</li>
<li>Utgard Mountain may also be the location of the Vault of Souls.</li>
<li>The Vault of Souls may be located at the gates of Doru Araeba</li>
<li>The soul of Brom may somehow come and guide Eragon to the Vault of Souls, where he finds the soul of Eragon (the first rider) and therefore gains the power to defeat Galbatorix.</li>
<li>Eragon finds the Vaults of Soul and finds the soul of Vrael, giving him enough power to destroy both Murtagh &amp; Galbatorix.</li>
<li>the vault of souls may be the weapon underneath the menoa tree ( Eragon could use a soul to learn new abilities giving him the ability to defeat Galbatorix)</li>
<li>Murtagh may have used the vault of souls to get so much stronger.</li>
<li>Eragon might consult the dead for advice, as Allanon does in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_of_Shannara_3dd0.html" title="The Sword of Shannara">The Sword of Shannara</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning the Rock of Kuthian</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The rock of Kuthian is the Vault of Souls because that's what Solembaum told Eragon.</li>
<li>The Rock of Kuthian could have been an old name for Helgrind, before the Ra’zac lived there.</li>
<li>The rock of Kuthian may be the rock Eragon used for scrying in <i>Vision of Perfection</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><b>Concerning Eragon's dream in the chapter "Deathwatch"</b></dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The two people going back on the ship 'Dragon Wing' towards Vroengard may be Eragon and Arya, and the person watching may be Roran or Murtagh.</li>
<li>The two dragons circling in the chapter "Deathwatch" could be Saphira and Murtagh's dragon, Thorn. The third Green dragon could become Arya's. (See <i>Regarding the next Rider</i> above) Or it could be Shruikan, who was freed after Galbatorix died.</li>
<li>The dream Eragon has in "Deathwatch" could be of him leaving the land Alagäesia forever as prophesized by Angela, with Saphira and the green dragon circling.</li>
<li>Someone important could die in "Empire" thus explaining why the man on the beach in the chapter "Deathwatch" let out an 'aching cry'.</li>
<li>As Eragon perceives that one of the veiled people in "Deathwatch" is a woman, it seems very likely that the next Rider will be female.</li>
<li>The two people boarding the ship could be Roran &amp; Katrina.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning Eragon's Romantic Life</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Eragon may marry Arya and become the next leader of the Riders. However, Angela prophesized that he would leave Alagäesia forever.</li>
<li>In the first book (Eragon), the herbalist Angela talks of Brom's failed love. Perhaps Brom and Arya were in love but it was not to be. This would explain why Arya is so desperate to not have a relationship with Eragon because of past memories; however, it is suggested or hinted in the books that Arya misses her bodyguard Faolain more than any other. Having been among mortals for seventy of a hundred years, she has apparently fallen into the human habit of keeping pain semi-secret.</li>
<li>Eragon can marry Nasuada since she is the ruler of the Varden and closer to Eragon's age.</li>
<li>Katrina may become the last of the Dragon Riders, forcing Eragon to mate with her even as their dragons couple.</li>
<li>Arya may discover that they are meant to be together, a possible reason being that she has been the egg courier for so long, hence dragon magic being unpredictable as it is, led to the dragon (Saphira) developing a link with her. Hence when Eragon became the dragon's (Saphira's) Rider he came to share in this connection with Arya.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning Eragon's becoming stronger</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Eragon could become as strong as Murtagh or stronger.</li>
<li>Eragon finds the Vaults of Soul and find Vrael's soul expanding his power enormously.</li>
<li>Eragon might unlock the Vault of Souls and attain Eragon's (the first Rider) soul, therefore giving him the power to kill Galbatorix.</li>
<li>Eragon may meet and be taught by a surviving member of the "Grey Folk" race, who might be <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasuada.html" title="Nasuada">Nasuada</a> because of her and her father's strange skin tone and body build(never explained by Paolini himself).</li>
<li>I have to add, GREY folk. Nasuada is of a DARKER skin color. Hence, although Paolini never confirms the fact that Nasuada is not a Grey being, I think we can hypothesis that she is not, because she is such a different character. That would be too off the scheme of things, I think that if Eragon does meet some of the Grey Folk, they are going to be entirely new characters altogether.</li>
<li>Eragon could learn to take energy and power from light, fire, and water. Oromis did not know how to do this, but said that one could get great power from these things.</li>
<li>Eragon may be able to draw energy from enemies, such as Galbatorix's common soldiers. I don't see why he didn't before though, during the battle at the Burning Plains. He was capable of drawing power from living beings, and that would be a two and one situation, he would gain power and also kill the soldiers. Why hasn't he done this before?&lt;Galbatorix's wizards were protecting them&gt;</li>
<li>Eragon may meet one of/the last of the Grey Folk and learn more than with elves. He could learn how to get energy from non-living sources or learn the true name of magic.</li>
<li>Eragon may use Brom's diamond tomb to store immense amounts of energy.</li>
<li>Eragon's ability to pull magical energy from living creatures could be a source of great power for defeating Galbatorix.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Concerning Galbatorix's continuous increase in power</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Oromis mentioned that he did know how Galbatorix continues to increase his power. He also said that it is possible to draw energy from light, fire, etc., although Master Oromis does not know how this is done. Galbatorix may be using this technique to empower himself.</li>
<li>There have been references to moving and replicating one's identity (soul) into another person's body. It may be that Galbatorix has found a way to imprison the souls of those he kills, in the same way that sorcerers use spirits to gain power.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Other</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is suggested that Morzan <b>cannot</b> be Eragon's father because during the trilogy Eragon is <b>fifteen to sixteen</b> years of age, while it is mentioned that Brom killed Morzan <b>twenty</b> years ago. Although it is never mentioned, most fans believe Murtagh to also be less than twenty, therefore Morzan cannot be his father either.</li>
<li>Brom may be Eragon's father and Selena his mother. This would explain why she took the baby to Carvahall and why Brom was always looking out for Eragon. Brom also said that he knew Selena well enough to miss her when she left. Eragon's dragon (Saphira)is named the same as Brom's and also the same color.</li>
<li>Brom may be Eragon's relative</li>
<li>Surda may expand to fill the dying empire thus in a way Eragon "leaves" Alagaesia "forever"(the empire is the bordering kingdom, not Alagaesia!).</li>
<li>Eragon may move to Surda or Vroengard or Du Weldenvarden, because these are separate from Alagaesia and would thus fulfill Angela's prophecy that he would leave Alagaesia forever.</li>
<li>Also fulfilling the prophecy of Eragon leaving Alagaesia is possible having Arya take the throne as queen of Ellesmera for her mother. Then Eraogn and Arya having a relationship and him becoming king. They live together and they left Alagaesia.</li>
<li>Roran and Eragon will go and slay the Ra'zaac to save Katrina and Sloan. Sloan will see Roran in another light and be happy with the marriage. Sloan will give Katrina back her inheritance.</li>
<li>Roran may be the logical successor to Galbatorix (The King of Men), as he, Eragon and Murtagh may possess the "royal blood" that still flows in Palancar Valley. It is noted in <i>Eragon</i> how Eragon and Roran are different from the other people in Carvahall. This might be true, especially if they are descendants of King Palancar. Murtagh is similar to Eragon in many ways, and was brought up in the king's palace.</li>
<li>If Murtagh is Eragon's only sibling then the title of book two would be "Elder", not "Eldest", according to the rules of grammar, elder means older of two, while eldest means older of at least three. This may mean that Eragon has another brother or sister, though Eldest may have been referring to the fact that Glaedr is the eldest to Shruikan and Saphira. Eldest may also mean Saphira is the eldest of the last three dragons. Even if the statement applies to the rules of perfect grammar, 'The eldest of the two' is sometimes used as a figure of speech.</li>
<li>Galbatorix might capture Eragon and have him drugged. Galbatorix then might have force Eragon to join him the way he did with Murtagh - in the Ancient Language.</li>
<li>Galbatorix may turn good again. (not plausable)</li>
<li>The green dragon may belong to a enemy, but the dragon falls in love with Saphira.</li>
<li>Eragon may force Galbatorix to free Murtagh and Thorn from his oaths.</li>
<li>The name of the dragon who presided over the treaty with the Elves may be discovered.</li>
<li>A wizards' duel may occur (perhaps between Eragon and Murtagh or Galbatorix). &lt;this idea of a "duel" isnt very likely becuse the fighters would need to gain control over the others mind wich would more be a battle of minds rather than a Wizards duel because to attak the other with fire or by throwing objects would be a pointless waste of energy since the Wards protecting the fighters would prevent harm the only way one would win is to gain control of the others mind wich leaves his own mind exposed and mean the other could strike back and neither would risk this so the only way to win would be to burn the other users energy down until it kills them + if the two were evenly matched it would probably result in both their deaths because i will take about the same ammount of energy to block the attack as it does to throw it out they may do this while battering each other with swords at the same time but to just stand their and fight in such a way would seem rather pointless because it would be a two page repeat of <i>"Eragon threw out a volley of fire wich stop short of Murtagh by about ten feet Murtagh fliched as the energy was lost but returned with his own volley of fire"</i>..ETC &gt;</li>
<li>Eragon and Az Sweldn Rak Anhuin will come to an agreement, which may involve either the clan or Eragon being banished from the Dwarf world.</li>
<li>Murtagh may die for breaking an oath made to Galbatorix in the Ancient Language.</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon_%28character%29.html" title="Eragon (character)">Eragon</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/r/Roran.html" title="Roran">Roran</a> may kill the Ra'zaac, possibly assisted by <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Dr%C3%B6ttningu_c465.html" title="Arya Dröttningu">Arya Dröttningu</a>.</li>
<li>Orik may succeed Hrothgar.</li>
<li>Eragon repairs the curse he mistakenly placed on Elva, and Saphira repairs the Star Rose of Tronjheim which was destroyed in the battle. The former may wait until later; Elva's burden might force her to become a Dragon Rider.</li>
<li>King Orrin of Surda might be slain, as so far the leaders of two of the factions have died from one cause or another, and he might follow the pattern. Queen Islanzadi might be exempt from this chain of events however, as Islanzadi is not going into battle herself.</li>
<li>King Orrin discovers gunpowder in his chemical experiments, giving the Varden primitive muskets and cannons for use in battle.</li>
<li>If Galbatorix is defeated, Murtagh and Thorn may emerge from their forced allegiance to the king and return to the Varden.</li>
<li>Murtagh may succeed Galbatorix and become the main enemy after Galbatorix is defeated by Eragon and the Last Rider.</li>
<li>We may witness a double dragon duel between Saphira and the third dragon vs. Shruikan and Thorn.</li>
<li>We should also see a lot more of Arya's earlier life and learn why she secludes herself and behaves in such a haughty manner. (Perhaps she was romantically involved with Fäolin, one of her escorts, who was killed by the Urgals under Durza's control when Arya was captured.)</li>
<li>Eragon could possibly learn a spell that can release Shruikan from Galbatorix's black magic therefore allowing Eragon to overpower him.</li>
<li>The village of Carvahall may establish a new village in Surda where their skills in farming, blacksmithing, herding, and carpentry will supply much needed resources to the Varden.&lt;this is basicly confirmd in Eldest&gt;</li>
<li>Eragon may be Brom's son as their dragons are named the same and also the same colour. Murtagh would definitely be Morzan's son as their dragons are named the same and also the same colour.</li>
<li>Eragon may succeed Hrothgar as he is a member of his Dwarf clan.</li>
<li>Eragon has rightfull claims to most of the factions, As a member of Hrothgar's Dwarf clan, he could succeed as its ruler. He also is the sucessor to lead the Varden, (there have been hints that Narsuada might retire or die as leader), and if he defeats Galbatorix, he has a claim to the Empire (another idea is the royal blood from Palancar). The other claims, which are weaker, are over the Elves, as a rider, and over the Urgals, as he would be high up according to their system of battle-honour. This could mean Eragon gets pestered to rule over everything, and then leaves to escape this, or any other possibility.</li>
<li>One idea is that someone important to Eragon dies, probably defending him (Arya/Murtagh), and then Eragon somehow gains access to Galbatorix's mind, and uses energy from Galbatorix to resurrect this person, killing Galbatorix at the same time. Another take would be Eragon resurrects the race of dragons using such a power, or rights another wrong somehow. (It is likely that the someone close to him who dies was Brom.)</li>
<li>Murtagh and Nasuada could actually be in love and this love along with Murtaghs love for Eragon could cause him to go against his oaths, killing Galbatorix and almost dying himself. &lt;M.E.- murtagh isnt going to do anything his true nature was revealed in the chapter "Eldest." &gt; &lt;it might b possible driven by compassion for Eragon his only closest living relative saves Eragon by taking a death blow for him alowing Eragon to finish Galbatorix&gt;</li>
<li>Vrael might be related to Eragon because when Islanzadi gave Eragon the title the Leader of the Riders, she said it was his inheritance. ( This is only because he is destined for that title because he may ((Depending on weather Saphira mates)) be the start of a new Dragon Race)</li>
<li>Eragon could learn how to cure Oromis and Glaedr of their disabilities and Oromis' sickness.</li>
<li>Joed may use the passage he and Brom used to steal Saphira's egg to steal the last green one.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a>'s prophecy of <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a> leaving <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alagaesia.html" title="Alagaesia">Alagaesia</a> may not come true. (Angela Claimes the Dragon Bones dont lie meaning Eragon WIL leave however this could mean tht Alagaesia ceases to exist when Galbatorix dies and the Elves and Surdans exapnd into Alagaesia)&lt;Urbanninja3&gt;</li>
<li>I believe that when saphira AND Eragon heal the star sapphire it will enable the gem to hold vast amounts of power (could be a super weapon)(but its too big to carry) which will help them defeat the empire. &lt;Urbanninja3&gt;</li>
<li>How could Oromis be kept secret all these years if he was a dragon rider. Galbatorix would have to know. Unless he became a dragon rider after the fall, secretly finding a dragon egg.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Oromis metions that the FORSWORN broke something within him he has to have been around before the fall and he could quite easily hide in Du Weldenvarden because the Elves have remined hidden here for so long without being botherd by Galbatorix) The possiblity that there were other eggs is also very unlikely becuse the Dragons would have know to give every egg to the elves during the war because it may have turned the tide of the battle)&lt;Urbanninja3&gt;</p>
<p>Oromis also tells Eraogn that he was there when galbatorix was being trained as a Rider, but he didnt train him personally. Also Oromis taught Morzan and Brom, so he had to be known before the fall. Why Galbatorix doesn't try to kill Oromis or get to him, I do not know. Unless he thinks he's dead. That would explain a lot.</p>

<p>Well, we decided to keep the speculation here, so people can put all of their crazy ideas without people taking them off...like my one theory about the piece of a green dragon egg that eragon stepped on.</p>

<p>I, like most people, asume the last dragon egg will hatch for someone on Eragon's side however for that to happen the egg will have to be stolen from Galbatrix ,just like Saphira was, and then a rider will have to be found. The dragon will be more likley to hatch for one of Galbatrix's people. <i>&lt; more likely is that a person who is sick of Galbatorix's rule may steal it and send it to the verden&gt;</i></p>
<p><i>just because galbatorix has it doesnt mean it has to hatch for someone on his side unless he forces it to like he did with his current dragon. the dragon will hatch for whoever it wants to and if it has to wait to be stolen by someone on eragons side then it will wait.</i></p>
<p><i>Also, things like learning of his hearitige or his missprounced blessing affected Eragon more than the 7 words that brom told Eragon before he died. This seguests that they are most likley to be some simple words in the acient language that eragon could use if he needed, or somthing simmilar. Eragon's reaction didn't seem to segest that they were anything extremly drastic or important</i></p>

<p><i>I thought it was Empire. I thought everyone knew that. I seem to recall some sort of interview with CP where before Eldest was published in which his said the books were named Eragon, Eldest, and Empire. Would someone try to find it?</i></p>

<p><i>I don't know if people have ever thought about it, but maybe since Eragon has the same name as the first Eragon, and both being a Dragon Rider, maybe they have the same true names. So IF they do, maybe someone knows the first Eragon's. Also Murtagh tells Eragon in Eldest that Galbatorix knows their true names, and i took it as saying he knows Eraogn, Murtagh's, and a bunch of other people.</i></p>

I think her not being the next Rider would be a dreadful mistake on Christoper Paloni's part as Arya is a elf with experience in fighting and magic and also if Saphira falls in love with the Green Dragon that would make Eragon possibly fall in love with the other rider, It would be illogical if the rider was Katrina (Roran's bride) or Elva (Person who is cursed by Eragon in the ancient language)or an other female or male rider for example Roran because of those reasons.Arlika150792 11:32, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Sure it'd be nice if Arya was the next dragon rider and her and eragon fell in love, bla bla bla, i'm sick of her running away all the time, i like her character and i swear Eragon is going to drive her to kill herself if he proposes to her one more time. But i think elva is a more likely candidate for the next dragon rider, although if eragon fell in love with her, EW, hes like way older than her. But that curse he accidentally put on her may link her to dragons somehow.</p>

<p>There's an official excerpt of Book III in Eldest, D.E. Could somebody add that to the page? It would be really cool!</p>
<p>I Agree all of us who haven't got Eldest D.E. are kept in the dark about Book III chapter one59.100.208.174 14:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>i think it was chapter three not one, and its a real cliffhanger.</p>
<p>what the hell is Eldest D.E.???</p>
<p>its like delux edition or something like that. it has an excerpt of the third book in it, and a picture, but thats the only difference.</p>

<p>it blows me away to see how horrible the eragon movie misrepresented the book. and after the unbelievable success of the harry potter and lord of the rings series from books to movies, i just knew we had another epic on our hands. i tried not to get my hopes up because i find i'm usually let down,(other than hp and lotr series) but i knew this series most likely would be put in the right hands. the directors of the movie should be ashamed of themselves and i'm sure chris paolini is disgusted at the chopped-up, horribly acted, third-rate cinematography, pathetic transformation to motion picture. way-to-go, another unbelievable movie experince is wrecked for me and everyone else who has read these books. luckily he hobbit is being made as i'm typing this. so now i have something to look forward too.</p>
<p><br />
The movie simply SUCKED. They left out a lot of things and changed a lot of the places. I mean what was up with teirm being a bunch of burning trucks in a freakin swamp?! I was also really mad that they left out solemnbum. I have a feeling he is going to be a very important character in the third book and he told eragon some things that are going to be very helpful to him in the future.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Talk%7EBook_3_%28Inheritance_trilogy%29_c877.html" title="Edit section: Theories on Murtagh and Eragon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theories on Murtagh and Eragon</span></h2>
<p>Most of you probably think murtagh is what like 18. Well i think that could be wrong. You see Brom said that he had killed Morzan 20 years ago. Then Murtagh later mentioned that he had gotten the scar on his back at the age of three from his father, Morzan. Now im no math genius here but that would mean Murtagh would have to be at least 23. But another point is that Murtagh said he escaped from galbatorix on his 18th birthday. I dont think it mentioned how long it has been since he escape. So if he had escaped recently that would mean that Morzan had to have been killed fifteen years ago at the most, which means Brom lied and he was probably hiding something. thats just a theory i was working on, but i think one of them has to be true im just not sure which one. either way people are hiding something important. I would really like to hear what you guys have to think about this.</p>
<p><br />
dude morzon cant be eragons dad because if u read the sinopsis of eragon in eldest it says brom killed morzon 20 years ago and ummm hate to break it to u eragons not 20 i think broms erogons dad because slen eragons mom went away for a wile where she met brom got pregnet had her baby in cravahall and left that would exsplane why brom stayed there the whole time too</p>
<p>yea but i think it said that murtagh escaped on his last birthday when he turned 18 so that would mean moarzan would have to have been killed 15 years ago. so morzan could be eragons father techniacally if this is true but i still dont think he is.</p>
<p>I doubt that it is possible for Morzan to be Eragon's father. I do think that Eragon and Murtag are half brothers. Brom said that he knew Selena and it <i>is</i> convenient that Brom was living in Carvahall. Brom may have been living in Carvahall to look after Eragon. It is most likely that Eragon is the son of a dragon rider. It seems like dragons like picking the sons of riders as Thorn did to Murtag. It would be strange though if Eragon was Broms son.</p>
<p>In Eldest, blagden says to Eragon about his father- "Father and Son alike, both as blind as bats" and oromis tells eraogn that Brom was blind to Morzan's betrayal to him and how he used Brom. Then Eragon says to himself that he was blind to something about Murtagh or something like that. And so , this explains Blagden's quote. i think due to this, that Brom is like deffinatley Eragon's father. Also, Brom was in Carvahall so he could watch over Saphira's egg, but i think this was his excuse to keep an eye on Eragon.</p>

<p>THis trilogy contains many similarities to plot, characters, and themes from the Lord of the rings and the original star wars trilogy.</p>
<p>Lord Of The Rings resemblances</p>
<ul>
<li>Ra'zac-Nazgûl(Black Riders)</li>
<li>Lethrblaka-Fellbeast(steeds of black riders)</li>
<li>Eragon-very similar to Aragorn(name)&lt;&lt;&lt;name similarities dont count. hes more like frodo, the person who no one thought could save the world but did. (well we hope eragons like that)</li>
<li>Alagaësia-Middle-Earth</li>
<li>Domia abr Wyrda-Bilbo's Translations from the Elvish(Silmarillion)</li>
<li>Alalea-Aman</li>
<li>Brom-Gandalf</li>
<li>Murtagh-Saruman?</li>
<li>Galbatorix-Sauron</li>
<li>Roran and Katrina-Luthien and Beren</li>
<li>Carvahall attacked-The Shire</li>
</ul>
<p>Star wars</p>
<ul>
<li>Brom-Kenobi</li>
<li>Eragon-Luke</li>
<li>Oromis-Yoda</li>
<li>Galbatorix-Palpatine</li>
<li>Murtagh-Han Solo/Calrissian/Darth Vader</li>
<li>Tatooine-Palancar Valley</li>
<li>Inheritance plot-Star wars plot</li>
</ul>
<p>Inferences ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THIRD BOOK(BASED ON TOLKIEN AND STAR WARS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Eragon will go to Oromis immediately.</li>
<li>Oromis (and Glaedr?) dies.</li>
<li>Brom's soul then visits Eragon.</li>
<li>Eragon goes back, finds Roran, and attacks Helgrind.</li>
<li>He defeats the Ra'zac and rescues Katrina.</li>
<li>At some point, acity will be sieged by Galbatorix, and the elves ride to its aid.</li>
<li>A final battle will be staged at Uru'Baen.</li>
<li>Murtagh saves Eragon by killing Galbatorix.</li>
<li>The Varden try to lure out the imperial army to help Eragon.</li>
<li>Eragon leaves Alagaesia for Alalea.</li>
<li>Roran becomes king of alagaesia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that these speculations are inferred only from star wars and Tolkien writings, and I put these here only because i have evidence from only tolkien and star wars.</p>
<p>Alagaësia-Middle-Earth???? Why? the names are totally different and when it comes to the landscapes and stuff it doesn't need to mean as a rip off LOTR. Fantasy stories are often set in fantasy countries like this. Narnia as example? I think Roran's escaping Carvahall with almost the whole town is very LOTR when they leave Edoras. But it's more belivable in LOTR</p>

<p>Is this a true fact or is this more BS?</p>
<p>No "BS" I know someone who works at Knopf and there was talk of an argument that Paolini didn't want the title changed from Empire but Knopf said the title doesn't relate to the book, But then again thats what he says.</p>

<p>What is the name of the third book in the Inheritance Trilogy? (aka Eragon, Eldest, and third book) I'll go crazy if it doesn't com out soon! and some of my friends think it's gonna be called 'Glaedr'</p>
<p>They don't realize yet that it has to be a 6 letter word that starts with E I also think its gonna be called EMPIRE</p>
<p>Anyone know Christopher Paolini's email address so we can actually ask him in person.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even if you could get his contact details, I doubt he'd reply. He probably gets too many emails similar in nature as it is. <a href="../../../u/n/a/User%7EUnaLaguna_51e3.html" title="User:UnaLaguna">UnaLaguna</a> 07:41, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On this website, they said that in the France edition of Eldest that it said the third book was coming out in 2008, but since we are in the US, it will come out earlier. Also, another person said that the third book is coming out September 13 in Australia, but i dont know if this is true. it was on the daily prophet website. but Paolini himself has stated that the book is coming out in 2007.</p>
<p>A lot of people and booksellers are talking about boycotting the third book if they don't get any information soon , but thats stupid they are going to miss out if they do, even though its really unfair how paolini keeps all of us in the dark on this one but im not missing out on the third book no matter how long it takes.
