<p>I have seen this discussion about "where Daniel goes wrong", and it is common consensus that it goes wrong at 11:40, correct? Now when I read this verse, it starts out with "And in the time of [the] end the king of the south...". Shouldn't this "time of the end" be pointing towards a completely different era, with other kings of north and south? - TagDaze</p>

<dd>Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say <i>anything</i> is "common consensus", especially on a subject as controversial as this.

<dd>It's kind of redundant, but let me rephrase that, then. The issue here is that starting from verse 40, Daniel 11 does not seem to conform with history. My question still stands. Shouldn't this "time of the end" from that verse be pointing towards a completely different era, with other kings of north and south? - TagDaze 18:51, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, there are all kinds of different views. The view that it does "conform to history" up til verse 40 is but one view that has received a lot of academic attention in modern times. There is also the view of the Gospel (Matt 24), that the entire thing is a future prophecy of the end times, and none of it corresponds with past history, at least from verse 6 on, where the phrase "at the end of years" first appears. There are lots of different ways of analyzing this chapter, almost as many as there are people who have analyzed it. In my own analysis, the clear dividing line or break comes between verses 16 and 17; that is, I read verses 1-16 and 17-45 to be two distinct prophecies of the end times, both referring to the same events, rather than a chronologically continuous narrative from beginning to end. Verse 16 ends with the evil ruler of the last days standing in the Holy Land, "and it shall be finished up by his hand". Verse 17 starts afresh with a new prophecy about the same events as in 6-16; by the time we get to verse 45, we again have the evil ruler standing in the Holy Land. Of course, as this is only my own interpretation, it would be considered Original Research and hence inadmissible for the article. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>No ruler of this name is recorded outside of religious texts. Although, Darius was a common title not unlike Pharoah or Caesar.

<dd>My error. Xenophon and Late Victorians: guess I can't tell them apart! If "Darius" is more than Bourbon "Louis", can you work your supportive material into the article? --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 00:03, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>probably could....though it seems kind of unimportant. Darius Cyaxares II is just a theory about Darius the Mede. however, he seems like he should be included because he fits the time period exactly. Darius as generic title isn't such a big deal. Most of my info was retrieved from (Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's <i>A Commentary; Critical, Experimental, and Practical</i> as well as a (yes) late victorian translation of Xenophon. i don't really care if it's included or not--Darius' identity seems like a rather long sidenote to make anyway. thanks, --john johnson</p>

<p>I removed the remark about "Symphona" because the Greek word "Symphona" references a group of musicians playing together [from which we get the obvious cognate "Symphony."] The word in Daniel which is being suggested as the "earliest exmaple of symphona" refers to a specific instrument which was a type of dulcimer. It is therefor not an early example of the later Greek form (as stated by the article). The remark was reinserted by a later editor.</p>
<p><br />
Since the sources I have indicate that the vast majority of commentators consider Daniel written by a single author, could someone furnish a source for that being a significant view, else it appears more appropriate to use language that makes clear that such is a viewpoint held by only a few scholars.</p>
<p>I disagreed with language "already drawn by Porphyry" in discussing the late dating because it suggests that there was a bevy of commentators chomping at the bit to decry its putative age from early times. The reality is that other than Porphyry, there is no significant historical attack on the earlier dating of Daniel until the 17th Century! Given that only one commentator introduced significant criticism on this point for nearly 2000 years [at least 200 BC to 1600 AD], I think "already drawn by Porphyry" is misleading. The alternative is simply to make a big to-do about how no other commentator suggested an earlier dating until the 17th century, but I thought that did not flow well with the paragraph [which is designed to highlight the later dating point of view]</p>
<p>Can we come to a consensus about these wording issues?</p>
<p><br />

<dd>What is up with removing sensible text, such as the following:</dd>
<dd>Textual analysis has established to the satisfaction of secular historians that the book grew in stages, beginning as separate Aramaic stories of the Persian and Hellenistic period, which were collected and then had a vision added possibly in the 3rd century B.C.E., forming the Aramaic chapters 2-7, to which were added the three 2nd century B.C.E. (see "Date" below) visions of chapters 8-12, and the introduction to the book, chapter 1.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was not to the taste of <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantym_71d6.html" title="User:Phantym">Phantym</a>. Or am I missing it in the shuffle? This is very poor behavior.

<dd>My edit to this page was based upon Wetman's revision of 14 May, while trying to integrate the views of Phantym. I tried to tone down the rhetoric to a level I felt appropriate; it could (and should) go further. I also feel that the paragraph(s) regarding the detailed chronology of the book's creation do not belong at the head of the article, which should serve as an introduction.</dd>
<dd>Note also Phantym's other contribution: <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecy_of_Seventy_Weeks_58fb.html" title="Prophecy of Seventy Weeks">Prophecy of Seventy Weeks</a>. It appears to reference a book by a John F Walvoord, which (as noted at the bottom of this article) is "A detailed, systematic analysis of the Book of Daniel with emphasis on studying and refuting nonbiblical views." This, then, is a POV source, and all information derived from it should be labeled as such. It is an eschatological investigation as well; the Book of Daniel has attracted the attention of plenty of like-minded scholars and dreamers, not the least of whom was Sir Issac Newton.</dd>
<dd>Here's a balanced commentary, which touches on the authorship issue: <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/daniel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/daniel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/daniel.htm</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mak</a><i><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMako098765_ef35.html" title="User talk:Mako098765">o</a></i> 08:17, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Well, for one thing, that is not the text I removed. I removed a paragraph at the beginning which simply stated without any separate view that the book grew in stages. Secondly, no source was given for the remark, and my source postdated the only source I saw when I edited it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I gave a thorough discussion as to why one of the specific facts [regarding the mention of symphonia] was removed. I do not understand why your post made no reference at all to my talk post discussing these matters.</p>
<p>Lastly, it was not "surreptitious." I stated flat out that I changed the first paragraph and gave the reason why.</p>
<p>The current version of this page is intolerably inaccurate.</p>
<p>First you cannot say "Most interpreters find that references in the <i>Book of Daniel</i> reflect the persecutions of Israel by the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucid.html" title="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> king <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes_2f84.html" title="Antiochus IV Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> (175–<a href="../../../1/6/4/164_BC_4ea3.html" title="164 BC">164 BC</a>), and consequently date its composition to that period."</p>
<p>The statement as written is simply not true. Secondly, even if it were true it would be a poor conflation of two completely different camps. As should be clear to anyone is that there are separate camps with different agenda, to the point that it makes little sense to discuss them in the aggregate. Thirdly, two of the most acclaimed texts on the matter indicate that a large part of those who subscribe to a later dating still affirm its unity.</p>
<p>Similarly, "Defenders of prophetic inerrancy..." does not portray correctly the situation, as there are scholars running a long spectrum, many who would certainly not consider themselves Biblical inerrantists, that maintain the question of dating and unity as open. The verbiage as written makes the group in the second camp (which, historically, is the majority!) sound like some framentary rebel band.</p>
<p>Another problem is that article incorrectly combines the unity and dating issues. The two are separate and have separate standing in the academic community. Any edition that does not clearly state this, as well as clearly state the documented existence of secular historians who hold that the book is a single unit [thought with a later date than their sacred colleagues] is not an accurate depiction of reality. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantym_71d6.html" title="User:Phantym">Phantym</a> 03:34, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, if you go to the history page and do a compare between yours and Wetman's revisions of May 14th, you'll see that you did remove that text. Second, the sources you have are not the only sources, especially if (I am guessing) they are mainly "sacred" sources. Third, you should make a note on the talk page at the same time you substantially edit the article, not days later.</dd>
<dd>I am not qualified to comment on the associativity of the unity and dating issues at the moment, but I may be compelled to do some research of my own. The important thing, in any case, is to make sure that all, meaning all, points of view are fairly represented. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mak</a><i><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMako098765_ef35.html" title="User talk:Mako098765">o</a></i> 08:32, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was quite clear in saying "Well, for one thing, that is not the text I removed. I removed a paragraph at the beginning which simply stated without any separate view that the book grew in stages."</p>
<p>If you go to the revision page you will see that the passage I removed was:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The book grew in stages, beginning as separate Aramaic stories of the Persian and Hellenistic period, which were collected and then had a vision added possibly in the 3rd century B.C.E., forming the Aramaic chapters 2-7, to which were added the three 2nd century B.C.E. (see "Date" below) visions of chapters 8-12, and the introduction to the book, chapter 1. The book now has two distinct parts, a series of narratives and four apocalyptic visions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This text (with no suggestion of separate view or that the view above is even up to debate) is the text I removed. My point is that things that are still very much debated should not be placed in the intro as though they were true. Rather, both views should be represented in the appropriate section. I think that is a very reasonable point that any person looking for a neutral point of view should hold. What is not reasonable is for a referenced statement verifying the existence of secular scolars who themselves support a unit view to be completely removed only to have its antithesis instantiated.</p>
<p>I apologize for not putting a post in the discussion page, I misunderstood the purpose of this page. I did, however, ask for discussion about important wording issues so as to reach a concensus, but Wetman did not respond in any way request.</p>

<p>I have revamped the history and dating sections and included a unity section so that discussions of various theories go in their proper places. To remove some of the weasel words, I have listed significant scholars as specific supports of various theories.</p>
<p>A general list of changes:</p>
<p>added an allusion to the possible movement of the book into the introduction. Removed all specific discussion of Date and Unity from the introduction to be dealt with in their respective sections. Removed the reference to "parables" as, regardless of their accuracy, the stories do not fit that narrative genre. The historicity of the three youthes thrown into the fiery furnace has been varied by archaelogical digs (in the sense of their existence, not in terms of the their actually surviving a journey through the fiery furnace) Changed "Persian King Darius" to "a King Darius of unclear identity," since the text certainly does not refer to "Darius" as a Persian and interpreters are all over the board with regard to whom the author means to specify. Expanded discussion of historical accuracy and moved some content from there to other sections to make a clean break between questions dealing with historical conflicts and questions dealing with date or unity issues. Categorized the various dating and unity issues. Clarified the state of objection up until Higher Criticism Gave an extensive list of scholars (both secular and sacred) that supported and those that refuted the unity of Daniel Fleshed out the issues surrounding Symphonia, which has now been found in much earlier sources than previously known. Expanded both the discussions on historical accuracy and dating by ensuring both viewpoints on each issues [so far as I could determine them] were expressed. Added links to two critical articles, one of which is part of a large set of secular historians attacks on Daniel. Added links to an article summarizing conservative responses. Added an objection to Daniel based on the term "Chaldean" Added an objection to Daniel based on Belshazzar's relation to Nebuchadnezzar Added support to conservative viewpoint based on details of early Babylon Added a discussion concerning the madness of Nebuchadnezzar as a plausible historical error. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantym_71d6.html" title="User:Phantym">Phantym</a> 17:59, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay- referring to "sacred historians" as trustworthy sources of information is inappropriate for an encyclopedia. The point of Wikipedia's NPOV policy is to allow the evidence for opposing mainstream viewpoints about a certain topic to be discussed in an article, yet this policy is routinely abused to put up unsubstantiated viewpoints alongside mainstream scholarly viewpoints as if they both have equal validity. The fact of the matter is that every mainstream scholarly work I have read about biblical history comes to the conclusion that Daniel in its final form dates to the period of the Maccabean revolt. Read William G. Dever, Rainer Albertz, what have you. Heck, even Encarta, a general encyclopedia which is fairly conservative, states that Daniel was probably written in the 2nd century BC.</p>
<p>The question of the unity of the book is an entirely different question that does merit equal treatment of both sides of the issue. The question of date is not- I know of no competent biblical critic who would date any part of Daniel to the 6th century BC.</p>
<p>Once again, you don't see this controversy in the articles about citrus fruit. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 20:30, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm no expert, but the article seems to present both sides of the issue. While it could probably be more upfront about the biases of "sacred historians" (and better terms for historians could be used), it reads to the uninitiated (me) okay. If you could mention specific books and/or articles, I'll take a look at them.</dd>
<dd>Feel free to correct the POV, but keep in mind that historians on both sides essentially cite evidence to advance their own POV. In an article like this -- covering a book of the Bible -- one side considers it a historical document and the other considers it the Word of God. It would be a major bias to leave out believers' views on their own religious text. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mak</a><i><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMako098765_ef35.html" title="User talk:Mako098765">o</a></i> 22:49, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After having read the article in its present state, I was pleasantly surprised to see a fairly balanced approach. I expected a highly polemic frankenstein of an article as many such are... This discussion page, on the other hand, shows some mistaken notions about NPOV that I want to speak for. First, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> does NOT mean that only "mainstream" views should be represented. You will not find the word "mainstream" in the article on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a>, nor will you find the same concept under a different name (at least at the point of my writing this). You will find rather the opposite: "All significant points of view are presented, not just the most popular one." Also germaine, from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> article: "As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. . . . Background is provided on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular." In other words, there should be no problem with a section detailing the position of those who hold the book of Daniel to be written at the time internally stated, but neither should there be any problem with providing the viewpoint of those who believe the book is an encoded document recording the visitation of aliens from the planet Nibiru (if such a view exists). It would be difficult to define NPOV as that which corresponds with "mainstream" scholarship. What was once considered progress by the mainstream is now considered oppressive by post-colonialist thinkers. Darwin's conclusions about evolution were considered poor biology by the mainstream of his day, but are now acknowledged as the foundation of modern biology by most biologists today. It is less fruitful for an encyclopedia (especially one as organic as wiki) to side with a position than to represent it carefully. --<a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJECompton_af90.html" title="User:JECompton">JECompton</a> 23:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh really? Did you know that there is a modern neopagan movement that is resurrecting the gods of ancient Greece? I don't see any Wikipedia articles on Greek mythology giving arguments for and against the historicity of the Greek myths- they are, quite logically, simply assumed to be mythological. A large segment of the American population believes the government has a secret trade deal with extraterrestrials, yet I don't see the arguments of "both sides" being treated in those articles. Why should the biblical accounts of magic and prophecy be treated any differently? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and in this case, the extraordinary evidence does not exist. Some of the evidence cited to be used by "sacred" historians is downright untruthful. The article claims that John Collins supports an early date in a 1992 work, but a 1993 work by the same author charactarizes the Aramaic and Hebrew of the book as similar to that of the Dead Sea Scrolls (2nd century BC-1st century AD), according to <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/1/011dan.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/1/011dan.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. According to <a href="http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/reviews/review028.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/reviews/review028.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, Rainer Albertz has claimed to identify the historical period of each section of the book based on its themes. Furthermore, the article cites standard apologetic responses as if they were legitemate arguments. Claiming that "Darius the Mede" is just another name for Cyrus the Persian or his officer Gubaru is ridiculous- Cyrus's name was Cyrus, and Gubaru's name was Gubaru. There is no reason to believe either of them used the "Darius the Mede" as an alias. Using wordplay to justify the reference to Belshazzar as "king" when he was clearly not king and as the "son" of Nebuchadnezzar when he was his grandson at best, and quite possibly completely unrelated to him, is simply ludicrous. Furthermore, the article fails to mention that the book of Daniel claims that Jerusalem was besieged in the third year of King Jehoiakim of Judah (606 BC) by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. This is unhistorical. First of all, Nebuchadnezzar did not ascend the throne until the <i>fourth</i> year of Jehoiakim (September 7, 605 BC to be precise), and second of all, there was no siege of Jerusalem in 606 BC- there were two sieges of Jerusalem, one in 597 BC during the three-month reign of Jehoiakim's son Jehoiachin, the other in 587 BC during the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. Additionally, the article presents the issue between "sacred" and "secular" historians as if it were a legitemate, scholarly debate. <i>It is not.</i> The article implies that only secularists date Daniel to the second century BC, when there are plenty of nonfundamentalist religious believers who, looking at the evidence without any preconceptions, feel obliged to reach the conclusion that the book is of late date. This is even in the commentary of some mainstream Bibles. According to <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/4/014dan.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/4/014dan.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, "The New Oxford Annotated Bible notes that '(t)he author [of Daniel] was a pious Jew living under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, 167-164 B.C." Another excellent translation, The New Jerusalem Bible, says the same thing: "The book was written during the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes (167-164 BC); his attempts to seduce the Jews from the observance of the Law... form the background of its message.'"</p>
<p>Lastly, it makes a reference to people who date Daniel to the 2nd century BC as "liberal" historians. The phrase "mainstream historians" would be more appropriate thank you very much.</p>
<p>Wikipedia does not engage in apologetics. I'm changing the article. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 20:30, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Daniel 9: Discusses 70 weeks of years, the account states that this period would start with the "going forth " of the word to rebuild jerusalems walls! Nehemiah's arrivel during Artaxerxes Regin in 455 B.C begins this period! The period is split up into 3 parts</p>

<p>2) 62 weeks; 434 years</p>
<p>3) 1 Week; 7 years</p>
<p>The 70 weeks are to predict "messiah the leader's" arrival and say he would be "cut off" half way through the final week, or 3.5 years from hes arrival! in order to "finish off sin" (or the sin offerings of the jews) as per the phrase "make attonement for error"! The first 2 parts bring you upto 29C.E (49years + 434 years) and half way through the final week upto 33C.E</p>

<dd>No they wouldn't. Daniel 11 shows a very detailed knowledge of Seleucid history up to about 165 BC, but is wrong in its discussion of how Antiochus will die. As such, that part of Daniel, at least, can be dated fairly securely to some time around 165 BC - before Antiochus IV's death. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 22:30, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Daniel 11 doesnt mention Antiochs IV's demise. Dan 11:20 depicts Octavian-Augustus as someone who "must stand up in his position",the "exactor" was the census of 2 B.C "a few days" upto 14 A.D where he "Augustus" died due to illness at the age of 76! not dying in "warfare or anger" Daniel 11:21 refers to "Tiberius Caesar" "despised" by Augustus &amp; not having the "Dignity" of the kingdom bestowed upon him, this reluctant ruler became Caeser because nobody else could be found! Also the "leader of the covenant", Jesus; was "broken" during tiberius's reign! The fact that the "King of the North" had changed to the roman "Caesar's" was further illustrated in Matt 24:15,16 where jesus refers to the "discusting thing (heathen romans) standing where it ought not("the holy place" or the jewish temple) as spoken through the prophet "Daniel"" Jesus is quoting Daniel 11:31. The Romans later attacked jerusalem, withdrew; (&amp; the jews who listened got out) the Roman's came back in 70A.D!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have no idea how Christian fundamentalists interpret Daniel 11. It's odd that you would take 11:20 to be referrnig to events after Antiochus IV, when most scholars (including St. Jerome!) interpret 11:20 to be about Seleucus IV, Antiochus IV's predecessor. But the basic scheme followed by secular scholars is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>11:2 - the fourth king of Persia is Xerxes, who invaded Greece</li>
<li>11:3 - the mighty king is Alexander</li>
<li>11:4 - Alexander's kingdom is broken after his death, and is divided up by his generals.</li>
<li>11:5 - The King of the South is Ptolemy I, and one of his princes who shall be strong above him and have dominion is Ptolemy II</li>
<li>11:6 - The King's daughter of the south is the daughter of Ptolemy II, and the king of the north that she marries is Antiochus II. She does not retain the power of the arm and is given up to Antiochus II's first wife, who murders both her husband and his new wife.</li>
<li>11:7 - The branch of her roots is her brother Ptolemy III, who defeats Seleucus II, the new King of the North, in the Third Syrian War</li>
<li>11:8 - more on Ptolemy III's victories over Seleucus II. Ptolemy III does indeed reign longer than Seleucus II</li>
<li>11:9 - Ptolemy III returns hom at the end of the war.</li>
<li>11:10 - "his sons" are the sons of Seleucus II, king of the North - the one who certainly comes up, and overflows, and passes through, is Antiochus III, who invades Egyptian Syria in the Fourth Syrian War in 219 BC</li>
<li>11:11 - The King of the South who is moved with choler is Ptolemy IV, who defeats Antiochus III at Raphia in 217 BC</li>
<li>11:12 - Ptolemy IV wins the battle of Raphia, but is not strengthened by it</li>
<li>11:13 - Antiochus III comes up against the Egyptians again with a larger army in the Fifth Syrian War</li>
<li>11:14 - The Jews rebel against Ptolemy at this point, presumably in support of the Seleucids</li>
<li>11:15 - Antiochus III comes against Ptolemy V in the Fifth Syrian War and defeats him without much effort. The Jews don't resist either.</li>
<li>11:16 - Antiochus III is successful in his conquests.</li>
<li>11:17 - Antiochus III gives "the daughter of women", his daughter Cleopatra, in marriage to Ptolemy V.</li>
<li>11:18 - Antiochus III tries to make war in Greece, but is defeated by the Romans and driven back</li>
<li>11:19 - Antiochus III goes back to his own land, but dies in Elymais while looting a temple.</li>
<li>11:20 - Antiochus III is succeeded by his son Seleucus IV, who goes to a great deal of trouble to raise taxes to pay off the Roman indemnity incurred by his father. Seleucus IV is destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle, but by being murdered by his own servant.</li>
<li>11:21 - Antiochus IV is the vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom, who succeeds Seleucus IV. He comes in peacefully, in spite of the superior claims of Seleucus IV's son Demetrius.</li>
<li>11:22-24 Not sure exactly what is going on here</li>
<li>11:25 - Antiochus IV goes to war with the new king of the south, Ptolemy VI, who is defeated</li>
<li>11:26 - More on this point</li>
<li>11:27 - Not sure exactly, but Antiochus IV and Ptolemy VI make peace</li>
<li>11:28 - Antiochus IV returns from his successful campaign against Egypt, but is against the Jews</li>
<li>11:29 - Antiochus IV goes off to make war on Ptolemy VI again</li>
<li>11:30 - The Romans are the ships of Chittim who come against Antiochus IV and force him to return without victory. In revenge, he does bad things to the Jews</li>
<li>11:31 - Antiochus IV pollutes the temple with idolatry</li>
<li>11:32 - Some will be corrupted by Antiochus, but others will revolt against him</li>
<li>11:33-35 - More in the same vein</li>
<li>11:36 - Antiochus will make himself as a god (note that "Epiphanes" means "the god made manifest")</li>
<li>11:37-39 More in the same vein</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is, to secular scholars, a description of the history of the Ptolemies and Seleucids from the time of Alexander down to around 165 BC. After this we get to an inaccurate prophecy of Antiochus IV's death:</p>
<ul>
<li>11:40 - The King of the South (Ptolemy VI?) now makes war on Antiochus, but Antiochus is victorious</li>
<li>11:41 - Antiochus conquers many countries</li>
<li>11:42 - Antiochus conquers Egypt</li>
<li>11:43 - Antiochus conquers Libya and Ethiopia</li>
<li>11:44 - Antiochus is troubled by tidings from the east and north and leaves Egypt in order to destroy things</li>
<li>11:45 - Antiochus makes his camp near Jerusalem, but dies suddenly, and none shall help him.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is, to secular scholars, an inaccurate prediction of the ultimate fate of Antiochus IV, who did not, in fact, invade Egypt again, certainly did not conquer it, and died, in fact, fighting the Parthians in the east, not encamped somewhere near Jerusalem. Thus, secular scholars date the work to around 165 BC. This has nothing to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls, because it is the inaccuracy of what are thought to be predictions of the death of Antiochus IV that date the prophecy so clearly - it is written after all the events "forecast" in 11:2-39 have happened, but before Antiochus's actual death, which would otherwise be accurately described.</p>
<p>Now, I am aware that this is not the view that fundamentalists have of Daniel. But this is the view of secular scholars, and it doesn't make sense to say that they would date it later if not for the Dead Sea Scrolls - the conventional date for Daniel is because of internal textual evidence that puts it after 167 BC and before 164 BC. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:20, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>20th Century secular scholars may interprit the verses this way!</p>
<p>But 1st century scholars thought otherwise. Matt 24:15;16 show, the "discusting thing" was not "Antioch IV" as moders scholars have theorised, But was the Roman incursion "removing" the "constant feature" (animal sacrifices)! Note that Matt 26:28 shows who the "leader of the covenant" is described in Daniel 11:22 to be "broken" during the king of Daniel 11:22 or "tiberius"!</p>
<p>I don't care what Matthew thought. <i>Jerome</i>, I will note, basically agreed with present day secular scholars, although he thought 11:21-39 referred only partially to Antiochus, and mostly to the antichrist, and thought 40-45 referred wholly to the Antichrist. But this is irrelevant, because my point was not what these verses refer to. My point was that you said that secular scholars would date the book later than the second century BC if not for the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is not true, because the way secular scholars interpret the book means that it was written before the death of Antiochus IV. This would be true even without the Dead Sea Scrolls. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 21:51, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Matthew didnt think anything, it was Jesus quoting Daniel 11:31. have you even read these verses, their very specific! My point was that, scholars date Daniel at 160's B.C because of the accuracy of the prophecies. They would date it later, because the prophecies continue, rationalising that they must refer to Antiochus, but they dont. the 70 weeks of years, the messiah, gift offering ceasing, the leader of the covenant, &amp; him being broken, all pinpoint 33C.E. onwards. The later "desolation", the "discusting thing", but the dead sea scrolls date it at 2nd Century B.C minimum.</p>
<p>The fact that the jews were warned to "flee" when they saw "encamped armies" shows the romans would make an "unexpected retreat" &amp; there would be a way out! Matt 24:15;16 as per the stake-out of 66A.D and later "desolation 70A.D"</p>
<p>This is all original research. Scholars do not interpret anything in Daniel as referring to Jesus or the destruction of the second temple. The description in Daniel 11 is accurate up to a point shortly before Antiochus IV's death. After that, it is not accurate (or has not yet taken place). As such, it is dated by historians to the latter part of the reign of Antiochus IV. This has nothing to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How could you interprit this quote from 33A.D as anything but the roman incursion.?</p>
<p>Matt 2415,16"when you catch sight of the discusting that causes desolation standing in a holy palce, as spoke of by the prophet daniel. Then let those in judea begin fleeing to the mountains"! Quoting Daniel 11:31 &amp;Daniel 9:</p>
<p>For secular historians, the fact that Matthew thought that Daniel was discussing the Roman period is irrelevant to an understanding of what Daniel is talking about. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:55, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your own argument invalidates itself! You say that Daniel tried to "predict" Antiochus IV "future" demise. Yet historians are themselves assigning events they believe Daniel must have alluded to!</p>
<p>Surely there would be no point ascribing "any" events to verse 40 onwards. If 40 onwards is made up, why assign events to it!</p>
<p>Also about the writing style of daniel, why would he write 20 verses describing 10+ Kings &amp; 25 verses only describing 1 King? About secular historians ignoring Matthew's account! Just proves their ignorance. If you had read the comment correctly, you would know it wasnt Matthew who reffered to the Romans! &amp; it isnt only mentioned in Matthew!</p>
<p>Who do secular historians say the "leader of the covenant" was, that was "broken" in Daniel 11:22,? Because;</p>
<p>First you have to know what the "covenent" was! It certainly wasnt a covenant with any foreign nations! It was a covenant that replaced the "Abrahamic" covenant. And the leader was the "Annointed" one of Daniel 9:25 called "Messiah the leader" Luke 1:55; Acts 3:25; Matt26:28; Mark 14:24</p>
<p>Daniel 9:26 says "Messiah wil be cut off"! And 70weeks of years pinpoint this to 33A.D</p>
<p>Daniel 11:22 says "The leader of the covenant will be Broken", these reffer to the same person! ^33A.D^</p>
<p>Daniel 11:22 in No-Way at all refers to Antiochus IV or his time period!</p>
<p>First point - I am not arguing the merits of the case of secular historians. I am merely stating what the basic argument is. The reason that 25 verses describe Antiochus is because the book was written in the midst of Antiochus's persecutions. In terms of ascribing events, historians are trying to figure out what exactly Daniel was saying in that part - he seems to be trying to predict the downfall and death of Antiochus IV, but what he says didn't come to pass. This is why historians think it was written before Antiochus's death - if it had been written afterwards, it would have described his actual death. As to Daniel 11:22, I'm not sure what is specifically being referred to, but I do know that historians have taken it to be from the period of Antiochus IV. Again, you can disagree with this, but I'm just saying that this is what secular historians believe, in order to correct your notion that secular historians would love to date Daniel after 165 BC. The fact is that they wouldn't - the date of 165 BC is based quite explicitly on the reigning theory of Daniel's composition. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:08, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Its been a nice discussion, and well have to agree to differ, dating Daniel to 165B.B.C doesnt explain the 70 weeks of year prophecy or the refference to the "messiah - Leader of the covenant", and him "being broken-cut off" in a 3.5 year period. And lots more not mentioned in this short discussion. The Census of 2B.C &amp; the "Braking of the leader" fit "Octavius &amp; Tiberius" Far more accurately, than AntiochusIV.</p>
<p>Just to let you know, there are at least three obscure interpretations of Daniel 11 that deny reference to Antiochus IV. Rashi (a very well known Jewish commentator) interprets: v. 17 Now the daughter of women he will give him to destroy her: this is the nation of Israel [referred to in Song of Songs 1:8 as] "the fairest of women." the king of the north will command the general of his army to destroy her. I say that he is Antiochus, the king of Greece who issued decrees against Israel, and he commanded his general, Phillip, to kill whoever identified himself as a Jew, as is written in the book of Josiphon. v. 20 And a contemptible person will stand on his base: then the kingdom of Rome will strengthen itself on its stand, as it says "you are very despised" (Obad. 1:2) and the Romans will rise and take the kingdom from the Greeks. Notice that Rashi interprets verse seventeen of Antiochus IV Epiphanes instead of his father, a proceeds to identify the "vile person" as the kingdom of Rome. Yefet ben Ali Ha-Levi, a Karaite commentator, denies any reference in chapter 11 relates to Antiochus. He identified the king of the north as the "king established at Baghdad" i.e. the Parthians and Sassanids (though their capital was really Ctesiphon), and the king of the south as the Romans and Byzantines. Thus he interprets verse 16-19 of Khusrav's attempt at besieging Constantinople ("a well fenced city") and makes the "vile person" Omar ibn El-Khattab, the Caliph who took Persia from the Sassanids.</p>

<p>Rob, the paragraph about the LXX is not "the usual apologetics seeking to equate Darius with Cyrus"... You seem to be missing what it is actually saying... Nobody is equating Darius with Cyrus, and at any rate, it is not "apologetics". The LXX is far, far older variant of the text than the Masoretic Hebrew version. This is proven because it usually tends to agree with the Dead Sea Scrolls canon, and seems to have been the only one known to the earliest Christians who quoted it in the New Testament. What this suggests is not that Darius is or ever was "equated" with Cyrus, only that he was <b>confused</b> with Cyrus, by the various scribes who copied and/or translated the text over the centuries, long after both kings lived. This is not the only verse we have where the Greek reads one king's name, and the Hebrew reads the other. I'm not sure what kind of cite would suffice, did you need a footnote citing the Septuagint itself as a primary source? Or would you prefer a secondary source where these variants have been noted? As for MADAI being used generically for both Medes and Persians, this is well known; coincidentally, I see some anonymous user just added the exact same info to the article <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medes.html" title="Medes">Medes</a> only yesterday...

<p>All right. Although I'm sure "Madai" was also used for just the Medes, even if it was sometimes used to include the Persians... for example, at the end of Daniel 6, when Daniel says that the Chaldean Empire would be divided between the Medes (Madai) and the Persians, so there is definitely a distinction there.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 04:25, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My understanding (from other Wikipedia articles) is that there are a couple of different Greek texts in addition to the Masoretic Hebrew text, and that the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> text of Daniel is <em>not</em> usually used as a source for the non-Hebrew portions, but rather something called the version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodotion.html" title="Theodotion">Theodotion</a>. I eventually found my way back to this information, but I was very surprised to see no mention of the source texts in this article (especially given how much other blather the article contains instead). I will try to fix this up, but this field is not my strongest point: I would essentially be trying to bring in relevant material from the other articles that discuss this point, and I'd hope a real scholar could do better. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Forste_ec22.html" title="User:Eric Forste">arkuat</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Forste_0400.html" title="User talk:Eric Forste">(talk)</a> 23:24, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know about this. The Theodotion version is the one that is normally passed off as the Septuagint. However, it is not the original Greek, which is much more obscure. Although Theodotion was Jewish, the early Christians at some point decided they liked his translation of Daniel better; the earlier Greek version was ripped out of nearly every copy of the LXX and replaced with the Theod. But interestingly, where Theod.'s Greek agrees in several places with what is now known as the MT (Masoretic Text), the OLDER Greek version tends to back up the Hebrew / Aramaic fragments of Daniel known from the Dead Sea Scrolls. This shows that the older Greek text and Dead Sea Scrolls represent an older recension of Daniel, while the Theod. Greek and the MT probably represent a newer recension of the text. As crucial as these prophecies are, you'd think more people would have studied the original (pre-Theodotion) Greek text, as I have. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does this article have to have a lengthy discussion of the silly theories that apologists have presented to explain the "Darius the Mede" nonsense? At the very least, our first sentence should not that most modern scholars except the presence of the otherwise unknown "Darius the Mede" as evidence of the late date of composition of Daniel (Darius the Mede not being mentioned in, for instance, Second Isaiah, or Ezra or Nehemiah, or the later minor prophets, who are considered roughly contemporary), and that it is generally assumed to be a mistake. We can have a brief discussion of the various theories outlined by traditionalist Christians, but it should be just that - a brief discussion. We should not refer to such people as "Christian historians," as though they are comparable to normal scholars, and as though such people have a monopoly on the use of "Christian" - as I understand it, Catholics and main-line protestants are perfectly willing to accept a late date for Daniel. Perhaps we could use something like "Evangelical writers" or "traditionalist writers", if Codex hates "apologists" so much. But the whole section as it is now is awful. It is arguing against a position which hasn't actually been set forth, except implicitly - the section is entirely about explaining who Darius the Mede was, with no sense whatever that most historians don't care, because they assume he's just a mistake. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 12:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This division is one mainly due to theology: conservative Bible scholars accept the Bible's claim that prophets can see into the future and then describe what they saw in spoken or written language. Modern Bible scholars, who descend from the school of German Higher Criticism, reject the Bible's notion that prophets can see visions of the future, that in fact Daniel had no such vision. This raises more issues than it solves. Many of the metaphors used in Daniel's visions are quite vivid, pointing to specific individuals and kingdoms. The specificity of these visions is the dividing line between the two camps. Liberal scholars must then, to get around the issue of Daniel's specificity, date the writing of the book of Daniel much later (see below) and attribute it to an unknown author who posed Daniel as the author of the book bearing his name."</p>
<p>Several problems with this: "This raises more issues than it solves" is a POV, and the whole paragraph implies that skeptics give a late date to Daniel <i>solely because</i> of a "liberal" ideological POV which rejects miraculous prophecy (ignoring all the problems with Daniel that are described elsewhere in the article).

<dd>Christians who believe in the accuracy of the Gospels do not accept this interpretation, ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Its source is not cited. The reverted use of "accuracy" rather the more contextually precise and well-established 'innerrancy' blurs rather than clarifies.</dd>
<dd>The whole sentence includes the following clause:
<dl>
<dd>because Jesus is said in Matthew 24 to have quoted Daniel as a prophet who foretold events of the "end times" to immediately precede Judgement Day, and not in reference to Antiochus Epiphanes who had lived nearly 200 years before Jesus.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Neither the first part nor the whole sentence has a citation. Moreover the sentence as a whole (linking the first part to the "because" clause) is a non sequitur, which is what the previous Edit (reverted 4X) attempted to fix. Failure to provide citation for this paragraph and reversion to a non sequitur leaves it open to a characterization of either POV or disputed fact. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmeeks_4039.html" title="User:Thomasmeeks">Thomasmeeks</a> 14:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And as I have asked repeatedly, what is really your motivation for attacking this belief? It was some scholars who stated that Daniel refers to events of 164 BC, but this view is incompatible with Matthew 24:14, so either you accept Matthew 24:14, or you accept the scholars, but how can one possibly accept both, and why should only one view be presented??? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The third paragraph of the Dating section was introduced on 11:33, 19 October 2006. If it is not original research, there should be no problem in citing a source in case of dispute. That is one use of citation. Disputed are:
<ul>
<li>the first part (before the "because" clause). Someone who believes in the "accuracy" (an ill-defined term in this context --see above) of the Gospels need not accept that Daniel was right about all the details.</li>
<li>conjunction of the "because" clause to the first part. That conjunction imputes a particular interpretation of Daniel to Jesus that is not required in the Gospel and a fortiori that is not required of those Christians today supposedly identified in the first part.</li>

<dd>This is a discussion that should involve all of the editors on this page, as I responded to you earlier several times, they should not be circumvented by attempting to hold the discussion on my talk page. I suspect that Matthew 24:15 is something you don't want mentioned or much attention being given to at all, because of what it says, and probably wish that it would just go away quietly and without any fuss, on whatever pretext you can think of to get rid of it. However, it is still there, and is unquestionably relevant to the Christian view of Daniel, so it is definitely going to have to be mentioned in some form. There are almost 2000 years worth of commentary on this particular verse, where you can find plenty of citation, if you have any doubts, or if you seriously think I am the first person in the world to notice what that verse says. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting indent) If it's so basic, I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding a reliable source in which the same argument is made. A source isn't required to connect Matthew to Daniel (at least I'm not arguing that), a source is required to establish the significance of the assertion, and to help define some of the terms used. this is because Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect the significant views of experts in the field, not your exploration of the the subject.

<dd>I have already provided the source. Matthew 24:15 makes the argument by itself. If the verse is accurate, then Jesus was not talking about a king who lived 200 years before him. Please make up your mind specifically which fact you would like additional citation for, and I promise I will do my best to find it. Is it a) the fact that this verse really is in the Gospel, and really does mention Daniel in connection with the future End Times; b) the fact that some Christians today do accept this verse as accurate; or c) the fact that Antiochus lived some 200 years before the Gospel...? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 02:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Codex, you've been around a long time, so surely you can see how this is blatantly original research? You are advancing the novel proposition that the only way one can believe "this verse is accurate" (whatever, precisely, that means) is by believing that the Book of Daniel was written in the 6th century BC. This is nonsense. Jesus is speaking <i>to an audience</i>. That audience, from what we know, clearly understood Daniel as referring to a future time. Even if Daniel <i>really did refer literally to Antiochus</i>, and Jesus <i>really did know this because he was the omniscient Son of God</i>, there isn't any contradiction with him using the verse to illustrate a point. At a minimum, one could argue that the verse both refers to Antiochus <i>and also</i> illustrates a larger prophetic point. You can't assert your own literalistic readings of the Bible as though they are the only interpretation. You can't even assert them as an interpretation which should be in the article unless you can actually find a real source that makes this argument. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 03:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this does appear to come under "original research". We are not allowed to use our "common sense" to link two obvious facts together and draw a conclusion from them: we must either present the facts without comment and "let the facts speak for themselves", or we must cite <i>somebody else</i> who has linked them to arrive at that conclusion. Also, the phrase "accuracy of the gospels" is problematic, because it's possible to assume that the gospels are a 100% accurate historical record and STILL assume that Jesus was wrong, or that the text was written in Maccabean times but nevertheless referred to the "end-times", or that Jesus was reading a new meaning into a Maccabean text, or whatever. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 09:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Gospel reflects a very significant viewpoint on the Book of Daniel. You have been pushing for some time now to exclude this viewpoint, and present only the contradictory viewpoint originated by certain scholars, for reasons that, if they aren't religious bigotry, I fail to understand. If a major viewpoint is not addressed in some form or fashion that is accurate and an acceptable compromise to all parties, I am definitely going to cry foul, appealing all the way up the chain of command, for as long as it takes, because that is blatant censorship and suppression. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:36, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The gospels themselves don't have a "viewpoint" on this: they don't say when Daniel was written. If a significant number of <i>Christians</i> have a viewpoint that claims to be <i>based</i> on what the gospels say (plus some additional assumptions regarding their "acurracy" and Jesus' supposed reasons for saying what he is alleged to have said), then you should be able to provide a citation (and hopefully tidy up the "accuracy of the gospels" comment, as this means different things to different people). This isn't about censorship, this is about consistent application of the rules. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 14:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am saying is that there are almost 2000 years worth of published sources -- commentaries on the meaning of this very verse in Matthew, beginning from the first century writers, up til the present day... I'm a little surprised that you don't seem to realize this.

<p>I don't think anybody disputes that conservative Christians a) believe that Daniel was written in the 6th century BC; or b) believe that it contains prophecies of the end-times. Beyond that, what you are trying to do is to define these Christians as being identical to "Christians who believe in the accuracy of the Gospels." That's a ridiculously POV way of putting it, especially when there's more NPOV alternatives - traditional Christians, conservative Christians, whatever. The fact is that you are basically wording things in such a way as to deny the Christianity of anyone who doesn't think the Book of Daniel is from the 6th century. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 20:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow, all in bold, and partially ALL CAPS. Well done, Codex. I don't see how the Christian view is not addressed. It is mentioned first. Then it is mentioned that many scholars disagree with it. I don't see why it is NPOV to then go back and mention <i>again</i> that Christians don't agree, especially given that you are using an argument for which you have not provided any citations. Even if you <i>could</i> provide citations, I find it problematic to include this particular argument, because it seems to be giving undue weight to one out of a large number of arguments that fundamentalists/inerrantists make for the age of Daniel. In particular, this is one of the large class of completely circular arguments for the inerrancy of the Bible. "How can you say the Bible has errors in it? The <i>Bible itself</i> says that it does not have any errors!" For such arguments, see <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">Begging the question</a>. Obviously people who believe the Bible is inerrant believe Daniel is what it says it is. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 14:33, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bold happened because I hit semicolon instead of a colon.

What I said about the topic of Christian interpretation of Daniel being such a weighty and voluminous topic as to warrant a dedicated article still stands. There is a vast amount of Christian literature on the subject throughout history, and you can't simply suppress this viewpoint in the dating section and call it adhering to WP:NPOV. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is suppressing the Christian viewpoint which largely, through the centuries, has been framed around commentaries and analysis of Matt.24:15, to not even allow the Gospel to be mentioned by name. That's really what this is about. The Gospel quote is 100% relevant to the Christian viewpoint, including the authenticity and dating of Daniel, but you seem highly inimical to the Gospel even being mentioned in this context. Its hard to have any fair discussion at all of the Christian viewpoint without mentioning this, or in the face of such bigotry as we've seen here. The Churches have got a right to a viewpoint on Daniel, it is most significant to the article, and it is being wrongly suppressed.<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oeralp - i would like to thank the participants in this long and passionate debate and offer a citation. Dr. Gene Scott is in an evangelical preacher (deceased) and bible scholar. He disputes the post-dating of Daniel in his Revelation series (Revelation 1-A #688, Oct 20, 1980), and references several additional biblical sources and scholars. I personally feel that biblical dating is highly complex and controversial due to highly fragmentary archeological sources. A new source could be discovered that back-dates Daniel and that would be another controversy. I feel the article is well-balanced. I happen to agree with Gene Scott's analysis but wholly accept that a) it is not conclusive, b) not essential to Christian (or any other) faith. I thank Wikipedia for taking on important scholarship despite divergant views. [previous signature deleted]</p>

<p>This has the advantage of immediate attestation from general scholarly sources without suggesting that any scholar dissenting is by that fact unmodern. A watering down?

<p>I don't think anyone here has addressed this issue, namely, what was Jesus' opinion of the authenticity of the Book of Daniel. Let's assume that if Jesus was God, He would not be in error, and would not "promote" the teachings or work of someone who was a blatant liar. With that assumption, the following comment of Jesus,</p>
<p>"'Therefore when you see the "abomination of desolation" spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place'...'then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.'" (Matthew 24:15-16),</p>
<p>affirms the accuracy and truthfulness of the Book of Daniel, via affirming the truthfulness and accuracy of Daniel as a "prophet". The point is, if the Book of Daniel was NOT written by the person identified in the Book of Daniel as Daniel, and if Daniel did not in fact experience what he claimed to have experienced, when he claimed to have experienced them (in particular, having several futuristic visions around the time of the Babylonian captivity, to within 70 or so years afterwards), then Jesus is not God, since God would not call someone who PRETENDED, FALSELY, to be a prophet a "prophet".</p>
<p>Thus, the issue of the timing of the writing of the Book of Daniel has implications for the truth of the Gospel, and the identity of Jesus as God. Note, of course, that in this missive, I have not argued (so far) as to when the Book of Daniel was written - all I have done is point out the issues involved.</p>
<p>For myself, I am utterly convinced of the early (in the 6th century B.C.) authorship of the Book of Daniel.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no "Gospel of Jesus", so basically you're just assuming that a comment in <i>another</i> book (written by yet another human author) is accurate about what Jesus said.

<dd>Once again, this is not a viewpoint based on scholarship, but one based on religious dogma. It is a significant viewpoint, and should be mentioned in the article, but it should be mentioned as a <i>religious</i> viewpoint, not as a scholarly one. Your arguments are, additionally, completely unconvincing to anybody who is not already a Christian fundamentalist.

<dd>"Religion" is different from "Scholarship". A religious person can have scholarly arguments for their fundamentalist ideas. For instance, a fundamentalist Christian scholar who believes in the antiquity of the book of Daniel could, theoretically, point to linguistic arguments for dating the book to the 6th century. They could point, theoretically, to accurate knowledge of Babylonian or Persian court life that a 2nd century writer would be unlikely to have. And so forth. But it's utterly begging the question to point to Biblical inerrancy as evidence of Biblical inerrancy. That's not scholarship, and it can't be scholarship. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 14:06, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, a scholarly argument is one that ought to be persuasive to anybody, whatever their religious views. Arguing that because the Gospel of Matthew has Jesus quote Daniel, that means that it's right because Jesus is God, is <i>explicitly</i> one that anybody who doubts the inerrancy of the Gospel of Matthew cannot possibly find persuasive.

<dd>The term "religious scholar" is deeply imprecise. What exactly do you mean by this? The viewpoint described above is, at any rate, not a scholarly viewpoint. It is a religious viewpoint. A scholar might hold this view, but this particular argument is not one that is scholarly. No peer-reviewed journal would ever publish such an argument, for instance. Someone who believes this argument might be able to publish an article arguing for the age of the Book of Daniel based on other reasons, as I discussed above. But the argument that "Jesus quotes Daniel, therefore Daniel must not be a later work" is not a scholarly one. At all. I would suggest that it is not an argument at all. Basically, the argument is "this one part of the Bible is inerrant because, if we assume Biblical inerrancy, its truth is held up by this other part of the Bible." It is begging the question, it is preaching to the choir, and it would be a joke to label this viewpoint a scholarly one. Again, this does not mean that Christian fundamentalists cannot produce scholarship. But we should distinguish views that are basically religious from views that are basically scholarly. I have no problem with including views by fundamentalist scholars, so long as they can genuinely be determined to be real scholars, with some respectability outside fundamentalist circles. But I <i>strongly</i> object to acting as though fundamentalist theology is equivalent to genine scholarship. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well this is your blatant POV showing again, because there ARE religious scholars through the centuries, and they DO make this very argument.

<dd>I say that this viewpoint cannot be labelled as "scholarly" because it begs the question. The Book of Daniel is what it purports to be because, assuming that the Bible is inerrant, there are other Biblical passages that say that it is what it purports to be. This is not an argument. It is a textbook example of a fallacy. The question of whether the Bible is inerrant is precisely the one under dispute. All the text from the Gospel of Matthew illustrates it that the author of the Gospel of Matthew believed the Book of Daniel to be genuine. The whole premise of the argument falls back into itself. The argument, which is essentially an argument for biblical inerrancy, is only convincing to people who already accept biblical inerrancy. Even if one is a Christian, one can only accept this particular statement as having any weight if it can be assumed that Matthew is, in this instance, accurately reporting the words of Jesus. There is no particular reason to assume that he is, <i>unless</i> one has already accepted a traditionalist view of the Bible. The whole thing is entirely worthless. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quite aside from 'biblical inerrancy', the scholarly argument seems to be that a Christian document refers to a separate Jewish document. This can certainly be used in a scholarly fashion to back up the notion that not everyone in the first century AD thought that the specific end-times prophecies had all been fulfilled in the second century BC, just as not everyone thinks so today for much the same reason. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to say, "No, that's not my claim, at least in its most general, direct, form.". You have it ALMOST right, but not quite. My "claim" is that because Jesus Himself quotes the Book of Daniel AND calls Daniel a "prophet", it is either the case that Jesus is God and Daniel was a true prophet and therefore the Book of Daniel had an "early" writing (circa the 6th century B.C.), OR Jesus is not God and Daniel was not a true prophet and the Book of Daniel had a "later" writing (circa roughly 165 B.C. or thereabouts). Only for those who believe in Jesus as God would the argument therefore imply that the Book of Daniel was written "early". (It would directly follow, of course, that anyone, in the face of Jesus' comment from Matthew, who claimed to believe in God but still believed the Book of Daniel had a "later" writing would therefore not believe in Jesus as God, or would not believe God is incapable of error, or would not believe that God is incapable of lying.)

I've also seen claims that Jesus spoke to people in terms they would understand, without bothering to correct factual inaccuracies that were irrelevant to his message, implying that he '<i>might not care</i> about the authorship of Daniel. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 16:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Consider the implications if it were true: If the Bible "contains some falsehoods" (not mere "typos", mind you), then how does one determine if its more "extreme" claims are valid or true? If Jesus is God, would He not be able to keep the only record of His life and ministry free from error? The answer is, of course, yes. A second question would then be, if Jesus is God, would He not desire to keep the only record of His life and ministry free from error (after all, if it contained any errors, it would detract from His mission, which [according to the Bible] was to save the world from sin, since it would cast doubt upon the testimony regarding Jesus contained in the Bible). The answer is, again, certainly yes.

In his 1992 Anchor Bible Dictionary entry for the Book of Daniel, he states "it is clear that the court-tales in chapters 1-6 were not 'written in Maccabean times'. It is not even possible to isolate a single verse which betrays an editorial insertion from that period."</i></p>
<p>In a recent edit, the following was removed: <i>Some scholars disagree with this, and still date this section to the Maccabean revolt along with the vision chapters.</i> The reason given: "redundant, already mentioned several times". But it looks like information has been lost here: I'm not seeing where else the text describes scholars who are apparently aware of this specific claim and disagree with it. The reader is now left with the impression that Collins has found something that others haven't noticed: the original text gives a different impression. POV has subtly changed. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 13:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It ought to have a citation to the "some scholars" who disagree with COllins' specific claim, if there is one... The article already mentions several times that scholars have statefd the exact opposit, but this suggests there are scholars who have specifically responded to Collins...

<p>Mr. Stevens,</p>
<p>I understand your editing of the information regarding the date of the book of Daniel. It was poorly worded. I do think you may have missed the point of the information. The intent of the information was not to elucidate the 70 week prophecy of Daniel but to show that the prophecy of Daniel was in use at the time of the Maccabaean revolt. Further that the Maccabaeans used this prophecy to further their moral claims for their actions. I have included below, direct historical citations by Josephus that substantiate the information I provided. The evidence shows that the 70 “week” prophecy profoundly influenced the historical record of both Jews and Christians. Sir Isaac Newton, in his Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms stated regarding the influence of the 70 “weeks” prophecy: “Some of them took Herod for the Messiah, and Hence were called Herodians. ….. They seem to have grounded their opinion on the 70 weeks, which they reckoned from the 1st year of Cyrus. But afterwards, in applying the prophecy to Theudas, and Judas of Galilee, and at length to Bar Cochab, they seem to have shortened the reign of the Kingdom of Persia.”</p>
<p>I realize that you believe that this discussion does not belong to the topic regarding the dating of the book of Daniel. My intent was to show that Daniel 9 &amp; 12 were used by the Maccabaeans in such a way as to prove they predated the events they supposedly fulfilled. In reading the other information on the dating of book of Daniel I did not see any other explanations that approached the problem from this angle. Hopefully you will at least leave a record of this information in this discussion thread so that others who have the desire may use this information to research this topic from a different perspective. This portion that you deleted regarding the Dating of the book of Daniel I have reproduced below. I have also included the full quotes from Josephus.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>William Struse</p>

<p><br />
Modern scholars not withstanding, some of the best evidence for the age of the book of Daniel centers around the early attempts to fulfill the 70 weeks prophecy of Daniel 9. Josephus in his Antiquity of the Jews (Ant 12:319-323; Ant 10:276-281)directly relates the Maccabean revolt to the 70 "weeks" prophecy. Modern scholars claim the 70 weeks prophecy was written after the fact. An critical look at the attempted Maccabaean fulfillment of this prophecy will show that in fact the Maccabaeans attempted to fit the events of their lifetime to the already existing prophecy.</p>
<p>Early Hebrew attempts to fulfill this 70 week prophecy were not calculated on a solar year basis. The earliest attempts were based on a lunar cycle. Had the prophecy been written after the fact a much more workable calculation could have been created to fit their need. The fact that the Maccabaean used 9 lunar cycles in their attempt to show that Judas Maccabeaus was the messiah is evidence that the Maccabaeans did not invent this prophecy. Symbolically 12, 13 or 14 lunar cycles would have had much more Biblical symbolism than the number 9. 12, 13 or 14 lunar cycles would also have provided a much more realistic length for each prophetic “year”. A question that must be asked is why if they had written this prophecy after the fact did they make its calculation incongruent with the rest of the Scriptures?</p>
<p>The following is a brief overview of the Maccabeaus system of calculation regarding the 70 weeks prophecy and the cleansing of the temple in 1290 / 1335 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>70 Hebdomad (“weeks”) = 490 prophetic “years”.</li>
<li>Each “year” was equal to 9 lunar cycles or 265.77 days. ( 9 x 29.53 = 265.77 days )</li>
<li>There were 69 “weeks” or 483 prophetic years until the messiah. ( 69 x 7 = 483 )</li>
<li>483 prophetic “years” of 265.77 days each were equal to 351.478 years. ( 483 x 265.77 / 365.22 )</li>
<li>From the 2nd year of Darius ( Hystaspes) in 520 BC ( the Divine decree to restore and build; Daniel 9:25) until Judas Maccabeaus cleansed the Temple in 168 BC was aprox. 351.5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Maccabaeans then used the 1290 and the 1335 literal days of Daniel 12:11-13 to show how Judas Maccabeaus cleansed the temple in 3.5 years from the abomination of Antiochus Epiphanies in 168 BC. It is important to note that had the Maccabaeans or some other later Hebrew author written the prophecy of Daniel 9 or the prophecy of Daniel 12 they would have used the same measure of time for both prophecies instead of the 9 lunar cycles of Daniel 9 and the 1290 / 1335 literal days of Daniel 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>69 “weeks” from 520 BC = 168 BC</li>
<li>70 “weeks” from 520 BC = 163 BC</li>
<li>Antiochus defiles the Temple in 168 BC ( Josephus Ant 12:319-323; Ant 10:276-281)</li>
<li>Judas Maccabeaus cleanses the temple aprox. 1290 days later in 165 BC.</li>
<li>70 “weeks” fulfilled in 163 BC</li>
</ul>
<p>The available historical evidence does show that both the prophecies of Daniel 9 and Daniel 12 were written at some point prior to the events surrounding the Maccabaean era, i.e. 165 BC. Based on this evidence the Hebrew Daniel cannot be rejected as the author of the book that bears his name.</p>

<p>Ant 12:319-323 319 So on the five and twentieth day of the month of Chisleu, which the Macedonians call Apellaios, they lit the lamps that were on the lampstand, and offered incense upon the altar [of incense], and laid the loaves upon the table [of showbread], and offered burnt offerings upon the new altar [of burnt offering]. 320 Now it so happened, that these things were done on the very same day on which their divine worship had stopped, and was reduced to a profane and common use, after three years' time; for so it was, that the temple was made desolate by Antiochus, and so continued for three years. 321 This desolation happened to the temple in the hundred forty and fifth year, on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Apellaios, and on the hundred fifty and third Olympiad: but it was dedicated anew, on the same day, the twenty-fifth of the month of Apellaios, on the hundred and forty-eighth year, and on the hundred and fifty-fourth Olympiad. 322 And this desolation came to pass according to the prophecy of Daniel, which was given four hundred and eight years before; for he declared that the Macedonians would stop that worship [for some time]. 323 Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days; and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon: but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honoured God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms.</p>
<p>Ant 10:276-281 276 And indeed it so came to pass, that our nation suffered these things under Antiochus Epiphanes, according to Daniel's vision, and what he wrote many years before they came to pass. In the very same manner Daniel also wrote concerning the Roman government, and that our country should be made desolate by them. 277 All these things did this man leave in writing, as God had showed them to him, insomuch, that such as read his prophecies, and see how they have been fulfilled, would wonder at the honour wherewith God honoured Daniel; and may there discover how the Epicureans are in an error, 278 who cast Providence out of human life, and do not believe that God takes care of the affairs of the world, nor that the universe is governed and continued in being by that blessed and immortal nature, but say that the world is carried along of its own accord, without a ruler and a curator; 279 which, were it destitute of a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, it would be like ships without pilots, which we see drowned by the winds, or like chariots without drivers, which are overturned; so would the world be dashed to pieces by its being carried without a Providence, and so perish, and come to nought. 280 So that, by the before mentioned predictions of Daniel, those men seem to me very much to err from the truth, who determine that God exercises no providence over human affairs; for if that were the case, that the world went on by mechanical necessity, we should not see that all things would come to pass according to his prophecy. 281 Now, as to myself, I have so described these matters as I have found them and read them; but if anyone is inclined to another opinion about them, let him enjoy his different sentiments without any blame from me.</p>

<p>So, this is tangential but related to the ongoing discussion in the "POV in dating section". I think the way out of this controversy is to greatly expand the sections on Authorship and Dating, possibly adding "Intepretations". I kinda was trying to set things up for that a few weeks ago , but I was rushed, and didn't do a very good job of things, and ended up making things worse. So, let me take a better stab of it.</p>
<p>Daniel is such a fascinating book precisely because of the two completely different ways of looking at it. With almost every other biblical book, there's some _basic_ agreement about the fundamental characteristics of the book-- so, for example, the Gospel of Mark-- I think almost EVERYONE on the planet would agree about its date of composition to within a decade or two. While the exact identity of its author is disputed, there's agreement about his background and his worldview.</p>
<p>But with Daniel, there are (at least) two COMPLETELY different ways of looking at the book. They disagree by 400 years about when it was composed. They disagree about the author's identity, his background, and his motivations. Similarly, there are wildly different interpretations of the prophecies and what world events, past and future, the visions refer to. In essence, Daniel is two completely different books telling two completely different stories, but both of which just happen to have the exact same text, word for word.</p>
<p>This makes Daniel an extremely memorable book, and while biblcal students may stumble over test questions about Ezekiel or Isiah, almost all remember Daniel easily and can write a good short answer essay about it, precisely because the story of the debates over its intepretation is so interesting. Right now, I don't feel like we're really "telling" this story in the article. We debate it, but we make reference to it, but we could do it better, I think, in expanding on this debate, rather than sort of mentioning it. I tend to think of things as:</p>

<dd>These are some good points. In response to <i>In essence, Daniel is two completely different books telling two completely different stories, but both of which just happen to have the exact same text, word for word.</i> - Actually, there are several old texts that are not exactly "word for word" by a long shot. More mention should be made of the rare original LXX Greek as opposed to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodotion.html" title="Theodotion">Theodotion</a> version that later replaced it ca. 2nd century AD. Then there is the very old Dead Sea fragments in Hebrew / Aramaic, that tend to back up the earlier Greek version. Apparently by Theodotion's time a few wordings had changed in the MT. Most of the Septuagint was produced in Greek around 250 BC, well before the Maccabean story. In fact, there are even stories in primary sources (Josephus <a href="../../../a/o/t/AotJ_2423.html" title="AotJ">AotJ</a> 11.8.5) that Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem in the 330's BC, because the Temple priests showed him a copy of the prophecy of Daniel and told him it meant he would be victorious. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to note, most scholars do <i>not</i> think that most of the Septuagint was produced in 250 BC. The Books of Maccabees, for instance, are included in the Septuagint. The general understanding that I've always read is that only the <i>Torah</i> was translated in ca. 250 BC, and the rest was gradually translated in the following centuries. Obviously, Daniel existed by New Testament times, but that's really the extent of the direct evidence. In terms of Alec's suggestion, I agree, to a point. The thing I particularly want to emphasize is that we need to make it clear that, at present, and for the last 150 years or so, the standard viewpoint among mainstream scholars has been that Daniel is a work of the 2nd century BC. The traditional view should be presented as the traditional view, but not as a <i>scholarly</i> rival to the standard modern view. I'll mention once again the distinction between presenting traditional views on Biblical subjects (which we should definitely do) and presenting <i>apologetics</i> for traditional views on Biblical subjects (which I think we should avoid. It's fine (and, indeed, necessary) to <i>describe</i> the traditional view of Daniel as written in the 6th century BC, and the reasons that Christians believe this. I'd much prefer, though, that we avoid counterarguments presented by fundamentalist Christians to the scholarly view of 2nd century BC authorship. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:10, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is older than New Testament times. I believe it was written in the second century BC. My point was that the fact that it is in the Septuagint proves nothing, and that the Septuagint was not written in 250 BC in its entirety, which is a very misleading way of describing things.</dd>
<dd>As to my "approach", I'm not sure what you're asking. Obviously I don't believe the traditional Christian view, and I think that the evidence points to Daniel being written in the 2nd century BC, as skeptics since Porphyry have suggested. In terms of this article, my approach is to follow <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and particularly the provisions with regard to "due weight." This means that while we should present the traditional Jewish and Christian view as being the traditional Jewish and Christian view, we should not present it as being a view which has any discernable support among real scholars, and we should not pretend that fundamentalist apologists are scholars. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:11, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're asking that question of me, I absolutely think we should avoid "taking" either side in a debate like this. I think John K is probably right that most "scientific scholars" of the bible have chosen to cast their lot with the 2nd century theory. On the other hand, many (if not most) Jews and Christians believe the Book of Daniel is just what it appears to be-- a work of divine prophecy. So, I don't object to the labels "traditional" &amp; "scholarly" as such. But we need to be very clear, and emphasize that the "traditional" view is in no way a tradition that has died out-- "it is quite alive and well, thank you very much," as an associate of mine once commented (speaking of the traditional view that Moses wrote the Torah).

<p>I'm not sure what "taking sides" means here. should we say straight out that the traditional Jewish and Christian view is wrong and the scholarly view is right? Of course not. But we should present the two views as the types of arguments that they actually are - the one is a traditional view, backed up by the words of ancient writers and the faith of traditional believers, while the other is a view formed by scholars based on evidence and the normal give and take of scholarly inquiry. I strongly object, furthermore, to the idea that "most" Christians and Jews believe the prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel to have been written in the 6th century BC. Most Christians and Jews, I would imagine, have not actually examined the cases on either side. Probably the best way to understand how particular religious movements view the thing is to look at what seminaries teach on the subject. I don't have any specific knowledge to back me up here, but my guess would be that no seminary for Reform and Conservative Jews, and no Catholic or mainline protestant seminar among Christians, teaches anything other than the mainstream scholarly view of the Book of Daniel. The view of an early date is one held by Evangelical and Fundamentalist Protestants, by Orthodox Jews, and perhaps, given Codex's insistence here, by certain of the eastern churches, whose beliefs on the accuracy of the Bible I'm not terribly familiar with. This is not only a minority of the world as a whole, it's a great minority of <i>Christians and Jews.</i></p>
<p>As a final exercise, let's look at what standard mainstream references say about the prophetic visions in Daniel. The Columbia Encyclopedia:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[Daniel] combines “court” tales, perhaps originating from the 6th cent. B.C., and a series of apocalyptic visions arising from the time of the Maccabean emergency (167–164 B.C.), which clearly presuppose the history of Palestine in the Hellenistic era after Alexander the Great (d.323 B.C.).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica [yes, that's 1911!]:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is now the general opinion of most modern scholars who study the Old Testament from a critical point of view that [Daniel] cannot possibly have originated, according to the traditional theory, at any time during the Babylonian monarchy, when the events recorded are supposed to have taken place...It is quite apparent that the predictions in the Book of Daniel centre on the period of Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 B.C.), when that Syrian prince was endeavouring to suppress the worship of Yarweh and substitute for it the Greek religion...The Book of Daniel loses none of its beauty and force because we are bound, in the light of modern criticism, to consider it as a production of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, nor should conservative Bible-readers lament because the historical accuracy of the work is thus destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Current Britannica:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The language of the book—part of which is Aramaic (2:4–7:28)—probably indicates a date of composition later than the Babylonian Exile (6th century BC). Numerous inaccuracies connected with the exilic period (no deportation occurred in 605 BC; Darius was a successor of Cyrus, not a predecessor; etc.) tend to confirm this judgment. Because its religious ideas do not belong to the 6th century BC, numerous scholars date Daniel in the first half of the 2nd century BC and relate the visions to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164/163 BC).</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is deeply embarrassing for Wikipedia to be more skewed towards backwards traditional views than encyclopedias published a century ago (although Britannica has obviously backslid a bit, as well). I don't mind describing the traditional view of the book's origins, but we ought to be clear that this view is not accepted by virtually any real scholar of the last 150 years, and is only defended today by fundamentalist apologists. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:11, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well that is hardly neutral language... It gives me little confidence in your neutrality, when you immediately describe anyone who would take this scripture seriously as 'backwards' and 'apologists'!</dd>
<dd>With such determined opposition to this one work, it's a miracle the text has reached us still in the holy canon at all! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:57, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, I'm not neutral, and neither are you. Above I was in part, at least, expressing personal opinions. I hope those parts which were personal opinions were apparent and could clearly be distinguished from those parts that were my views on what the article should be. All remarks about backwardness should perhaps be taken for the former. But the issue is not who "takes the scripture seriously." Among other things, it's deeply obnoxious to describe scholars who have devoted their lives to the study of Biblical texts as people who don't "take scripture seriously" just because they don't accept fundamentalist views of the book. I have no "opposition" to the Book of Daniel, an idea that I don't even understand. i don't "oppose" the Book of Daniel any more than I oppose the Epic of Gilgamesh, or the Song of Roland - one can't oppose a work of literature. I merely have come to the conclusion that the prophetic sections of Daniel were most likely written in the 2nd century BC around the time of the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes. In this conclusion I merely join the vast majority of mainstream scholarship of the last two hundred years. I don't see what on earth this has to do with "opposing" the Book of Daniel, and the fact that you think this shows pretty clearly that you have no greater claim to neutrality than I do. At any rate, there are two ways to believe that the Book of Daniel is as old as tradition states. In the first place, you can be ignorant of, or fail to engage with, the modern scholarly opinion. This is more or less the situation of most traditionalists. They either simply accept Daniel at face value, without being aware of competing theories, or they ignore the competing theories as unimportant. I am perfectly fine with this viewpoint being represented in wikipedia, and with explaining the importance that many Christian groups place in the prophecies in Daniel. The other way, however, is to actively dispute with the scholarly account. This I think the article should not do. Writings trying to disprove the scholarly consensus on the date of the prophetic sections of Daniel are invariably fundamentalist polemics, rather than dispassionate scholarly works. They are not in the mainstream of scholarship, nor are they in the mainstream of traditional religious views, which simply ignore the scholarly view of the book. This material should not be discussed in this article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sounds like you are disqualifying evidence right off the bat and have begun scoffing even before hearing any actual evidence. That's hardly logical, and it immediately sets the bar impossibly high. So if it makes the so-called "accepted scholarly view" look bad, it's automatically inadmissible? There is one author already quoted in the article as saying there is nothing whatsoever in the text definitively indicative of a Maccabean era date, and I'm inclined to agree with him that what evidence has been presented, such as it is, seems awfully flimsy and forced to fit around the Maccabean story, and should bear thorough examination, rather than being accepted at face value.</dd>
<dd>It should be obvious that the 'people in charge' had already succeeded in sigificantly altering the official text of Daniel in several places, sometime <i>after</i> the Dead Sea Scrolls, but <i>before</i> Theodotion. The opposition to the older form of the prophecy was so great, that a massive campaign was undertaken in the 300s to replace every single Greek Bible in the world with the Theodotion translation of Daniel, something not done for any other Bible book. In fact, to this day, nearly all English "translations" of the Septuagint follow Theodotion's 2nd century AD version for Daniel, and the older Greek LXX text of Daniel is difficult, though not impossible, to find anywhere nowadays, let alone an English rendering of it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:29, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point isn't that the accepted scholarly view is unchallengeable. But we can only cite criticisms of it by reliable sources. Fundamentalist apologetics are not reliable sources on the subject of Bible criticism (although they are perhaps reliable sources on the subject of what fundamentalists believe). If an actual scholar has come forward to challenge this, it should be given due weight. John Collins, who I assume is the one you mention, seems to only be discussing the Court Tales portion in saying that he doesn't think a Maccabean date is correct, and even that is, as far as I know, a minority position. There has yet to be any actual scholar cites who believes that the visions portions of Daniel date from earlier than Maccabean times. Your whole later discussion is, so far as I can tell, OR. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:37, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you have been here this long and still not have the slightest understanding of what basic wikipedia policies mean. Of course many people have believed that Daniel is older. But the <i>specific</i> arguments you are making above, about the Theodotion text and so forth, appear to be OR. If they are not OR, you ought to cite your source. Beyond that, I am <i>not</i> determined to keep the beliefs of Christians (and Jews), and the historical teachings of Christian Churches (and Orthodox Jews) as to the age of Daniel out of the article. What I am determined about is that we not present these <i>religious</i> views as though they are <i>scholarly</i> views. If a conservative scholar has made a useful contribution to scholarship that has been published by an academic publishing house or a peer-reviewed journal, or something similar, that's fine. But fundamentalist polemics about the age of the Book of Daniel are not scholarly works any more than fundamentalist polemics about the age of the Grand Canyon are. Because the Book of Daniel, unlike the Grand Canyon, is a topic relating to religion, we have to present the religious views that people hold of it. But those views have no more place in a discussion of <i>scholarly</i> views of Daniel than works stating that the Grand Canyon is 6000 years old. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am basically okay with describing the 2nd century theory as the view held by "most biblical scholars" or such, so long as we're crystal clear that "scholarly does not mean <b>right</b> or <b>true</b>". Similarly, you can't say that someone who disagrees with the 2nd century theory must not be a scholar, based solely on their disagreement. It's interesting that the view quoted by Thomas above seems to suggest the official catholic position is in line with the 2nd century theory-- I was just about to quote the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04621b.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04621b.htm" rel="nofollow">Catholic Encyclopedia entry</a> on the Book of Daniel which supports the theory that the author was, in fact, the prophet Daniel.</p>
<p>In any case, I think we're having a debate we don't really need to be having. We're not going to decide when the book was written, or by whom. What remains for us is to describe each POV to the best of our ability, to describe who believes what, and why they believe that, and what insights they draw from be book based on that view. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 21:06, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Catholic Encyclopedia found online at New Advent was put out in 1917. It does not represent current Catholic thinking on such subjects, which has changed a great deal in the last 90 years in the way of opening up to mainstream, non-Catholic scholarship. I doubt that the Church itself has taken any "official" position on the date of the book of Daniel, but I'd guess that nearly all scholars at mainstream Catholic institutions hold views indistinguishable from the "mainstream scholarly view" of 2nd century authorship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd add that it is emphatically not my position that anyone who disagrees with the mainstream scholarly position is not a scholar. It is, however, my position that people who are not scholars and who differ from the 2nd century theory are not scholars. The reason I want to exclude fundamentalist polemic is because it's fundamentally unscholarly. These people have already decided what the answer is, and are merely cherry-picking evidence to support the view they already "know" is right, due to revelation. The reason such people believe that the Book of Daniel is from the 6th century is not because a dispassionate assessment of the evidence leads to that conclusion. It is because they have already derived that conclusion from faith. This is fundamentally contrary to scholarly endeavor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to your suggestions for where to go from here, I'm not sure. If by describing why people believe that the Book of Daniel was written in the 6th century BC, you mean that we should say that the book itself announces itself to be such, that centuries of Christian and Jewish interpreters accepted that claim, and that many today continue to accept it because of their belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, and the specific importance of the prophecies of Daniel in particular, I'm right there with you. If you mean that we should engage in discussions of how apparent anachronisms in the court tales aren't actually anachronisms, and lengthy discussions of "evidence" that the prophecy sections were written before the 2nd century BC, then I'm not willing to go there. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:42, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two positions should not be treated as equivalent. One is a position largely supported by scholars, the other one largely supported by religious believers. These are different <i>kinds</i> of views, and treating them as though they are the same is highly problematic. But discussion with you on this subject is obviously pointless. If Alec wants to go ahead and reorganize, he should feel free. It's hard to imagine his proposal turning out worse than the current article, and I don't have the patience or, at the moment, the resources, to do an actual thoroughgoing rewrite of this mess. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 22:46, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What bishops? I haven't mentioned any bishops? What in the world are you talking about? The Catholic Church does not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, so there is no need to question the canonicity of a text simply because it is not exactly what it purports to be. I think the view of most non-fundamentalist groups is that the Book of Daniel has spiritual value even if it was written in the 2nd century BC, showing the importance of faith and bla bla bla. As to neutrality, neutrality does not require us to treat fundamentalist polemics as though they are equivalent to actual scholarship. That is ridiculous. Viewpoints that are equally important should be given equal treatment, but if the two viewpoints are essentially different <i>in kind</i> (e.g., one is a religious view, based on faith in the dogmas of a particular religious ect, the other is based on the tradition of critical scholarship) we should not treat them as though they are the same.

<dd>Could you please stop saying that only atheists believe in a late date for Daniel? This just isn't true. The vast majority of Christians (including, at least, Catholics and mainline Protestants), as well as all non-Orthodox (and perhaps even some modern Orthodox, I'm not sure) Jews, accept the later date of Daniel. Claiming the mantle of "religion," when what you really mean is "my particular religion," is very obnoxious. And, as I've <i>repeatedly</i> stated, I'm happy to discuss traditional views of the Book of Daniel in the article, and whatever churches may support such views.

<dd>According to the Gospels, Jesus Christ himself appealed to the authority of Daniel (the pre-Theodotion version, presumably) in one of his very last messages to his followers, expressly telling them to be wary for the future last days. If some Christians and even Churches today choose to turn their back on these words, that can all be mentioned also, but what we cannot do is hold a second Council of Nicea on wikipedia, and determine which books must be regarded as uninspired. For those Churches that accept a canon, the decision on what books are inspired has already been made elsewhere. Also, in the year 200 AD, the people who adhered to and defended the word were called 'apologists' by the pagan intellectuals, because they were seen as apologizing for not worshipping Jupiter. It's an outdated term. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A) Your explanation of the origins of "apologists" is pretty obviously a folk etymology. "Apology" originally meant "defense". The "Apology of Socrates" was not Socrates apologizing in the modern sense, it was Socrates' defense of himself in his trial. Early Christian "apologists" were early defenders of Christianity. The idea that it has anything to do with Jupiter strikes me as ridiculous, and I'd love to see a source for that claim. B) Your initial points don't make any sense. That Christian and Jewish groups accept a Canon and accept that Biblical books are "inspired" does not tell us anything about how to interpret their content, because there's any number of ways to interpret the idea of inspiration. That it means that everything in the Bible is literally true is only one of those ways, and it is one that most mainstream Christians and Jews do not agree with. I have no idea what any of this has to do with a second Council of Nicea. The basic point is that you are not the guardian of what Christians believe, and Christians who don't believe in the literal truth of the Bible are no less Christians simply because you disagree with them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From that article: <i>Today the term "apologist" is colloquially applied in a general manner to include groups and individuals systematically promoting causes, justifying orthodoxies, or denying certain events, even of crimes. Apologists have been characterized as being deceptive, or "whitewashing" their cause, primarily through omission of negative facts (selective perception) and exaggeration of positive ones, techniques of classical rhetoric. When used in this context, the term often has a pejorative meaning. The neutralized substitution of "spokesperson" for "apologist" in conversation conveys much the same sense of "partisan presenter with a weighted agenda," with less rhetorical freight.</i> <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Codex, you don't seem to understand what I'm trying to do. No one is trying to decide whether or not Daniel should be considered "inspired". Regarding a book as inspired is solely a matter of faith that the article does not, and should not, directly attempt to suport or refute. It should (and does) say that some religious interpretations see the book is inspired. The issue is not inspiration, but historical accuracy.</p>
<p>Remember the concept of <b>undue weight</b> from <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>:</p>
<p>NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a verifiable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each. Now an important qualification: <b>Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and may not include tiny-minority views at all (by example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority). We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view, and views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented except in articles devoted to those views. To give undue weight to a significant-minority view, or to include a tiny-minority view, might be misleading as to the shape of the dispute. <i>Wikipedia aims to present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject</i>, or among the concerned parties.</b> This applies not only to article text, but to images, external links, categories, and all other material as well.</p>
<p>Undue weight applies to more than just viewpoints. Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements. An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.</p>
<p>Minority views can receive attention on pages specifically devoted to them — Wikipedia is not paper. But on such pages, though a view may be spelled out in great detail, it should not be represented as the truth.</p>
<pre>
   <b>From Jimbo Wales, paraphrased from this post from September 2003 on the mailing list:</b>
</pre>
<pre>
       * If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;
       * If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;
       * If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it is true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.
</pre>
<p>Views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all.</p>
<p>If you are able to prove something that no one or few currently believe, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a proof. Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced. See: Wikipedia:Attribution</p>
<p>I can name commonly accepted non-specialist reference books that cite a second-century date for Daniel as fact: Encarta, Britannica, Jewish Encyclopedia. You can't accuse these sources (especially the last one) as having "atheistic agendas" unless you wish to accuse the Western academic tradition as a whole of having an atheistic agenda. Then there are specialist publications such as the Anchor Bible Dictionary, any non-sectarian commentaries (Anchor Bible, Hermeneia, etc.), and theologically liberal sectarian commentaries (Jewish Publication Society, etc.). Articles written in non-sectarian specialist journals accept the second-century date as a given. (see <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/PDF/Wooden_Changing.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.sbl-site.org/PDF/Wooden_Changing.pdf" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, for example, written by an author form Acadia Divinity College, and published in the Society of Biblical Literature Periodical). And how about the Jerusalem Bible, officially endorsed by the Catholic Church? In its introduction to Daniel, it states: "The Book of Daniel was written by a pious Jew in the second century BC in order to give his co-religionists hope during the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes." Why would an expressly Catholic writing, whose author still sees the book as inspired, and who 90 years ago would not dare to make such a statement, acknowledge this unless there was an overwhelming scholarly consensus as to the date and provenance of the writing?</p>
<p>What I can't accept is your lack of respect for historical-critical scholarship. Yes it has naturalistic presuppositions. By this I mean that it does not start by regarding the Bible as Holy Writ, but as a textual artifact that has come down to us from antiquity and must be analyzed in the same manner as all other such texts. <i>The foundation of the Enlightenment tradition of scholarship was the jettisoning of all previous presuppositions about all topics and studying them anew without being constrained by unquestionable starting points.</i> Fundamentalist publications such as you cite do not work in this tradition: they are not peer-reviewed (such as SBL or Anchor Bible), nor are they non-sectarian reference books whose information is at least derived from peer-reviewed sources, like Encarta or Britannica. They have an explicit sectarian agenda, and only address peer-reviewed material for the purpose of refuting it. Their arguments pay no attention to the principle of <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>; they start with the assumption that there can be no inaccuracies, and that apparent inaccuracies must have explanations. Their attempt to provide such explanations uses reasoning which would not be acceptable in either a court of law or a peer-reviewed publication.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 02:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all due respect, I don't think a viewpoint espoused by Jesus himself according to the Gospels, and adhered to by millions of his faithful followers who cherish his words, can be brushed aside as "insignificant" by any manipulation or spindoctoring of the "Undue weight" policy. The weight is very, very due.

<p>Read my whole post. It doesn't matter how many people believe a certain thing.

<dd>I don't think can be any doubt that the 6th century authorship theory is not an "extreme minority viewpoint". It's a toss up as to whether it could realistically be called a minority viewpoint. In general, we just have to describe the debate, we don't have to decide it. The consensus of secular historians and scholars, and those who share their worldview, is always going to be 2nd century authorship. The consensus of theologians who believe in biblical inerrancy is always goinb to be 6th century authorship. People in the middle are going to be split. So long as we don't characterize the 6th century authorship as a the secular scholarly POV, and so long as we don't characterize the 2nd century authorship as the biblical inerrancy POV-- we'll be fine. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 02:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Believing in 6th century authorship is not an "extreme minority viewpoint." Actually making arguments in defense of 6th century authorship, however, is.

<p>But the apologetics used by believers in biblical inerrancy to attack the secular viewpoint have no place in the article. They are apologetics, and come with the usual misrepresentation and flawed logic. There is no problem saying what the position of inerrantists is; but we are not obliged to defend them. That's the difference- <i>the secular consensus was arrived at after the evaluation of evidence; proponents of the inerrantist viewpoint use evidence only to defend their original position.</i> In doing so, they selectively and misquote supportors of the opposing viewpoint (when Rowley said Daniel was "a first class historical source for the period in question", I suspect he meant the Hellenistic period; this incomplete quote is integrated into the article to make it seem like he meant the Babylonian period) and cite interpretations of the evidence that are in no way straightforward (why would we think "Darius the Mede" is supposed to be someone who is never called Darius in the contemporary sources other than under the presupposition that the book cannot be wrong?). This is not presenting opposing evidence that supports a viewpoint. This is polemic, using the same evidence but interpreting it in non-straightforward ways and deliberately misquoting supporters of an opposing view.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 03:12, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nobody's stopping Jesus' words from being mentioned in the article, as long as they are acknowledged to be part of the \traditional views.

<dd>Instead of turning a blind eye to the actual evidence, why not mention that the document Jesus referred to woul have been much closer to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the pre-THeodotion LXX Daniel, a far cry from the Theodotion and Masoretic text found in Bibles today? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 03:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect the reason so many, probably most Christians adhere to the 6th century BC date (aside from Jesus words) is the fact that the 2nd century BC crowd has yet to come up with any actual evidence of Maccabean authorship that stands the test of reason. It's just not convincing to argue "We have determined it is Maccabean, and so you should not believe in it, but we can't tell you why, you just have to take our expertise for it". All of the arguments have been attacked and refuted, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> demands that the article not become the one-sided opinion piece you are trying to foist on it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 03:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, stop with the rhetoric. The evidence is presented in the article; most non-conservative Christians <i>do</i> accept the 2nd century dating, and the alleged refutations have not been submitted for peer review, because they would not pass it <i>Read my post right above yours</i>.</p>

<dd>Academia is entitled to their views, but not to pretend they are the only views.

<p>If you have access to a university library, I suggest you go over all non-sectarian commentaries of Daniel that you find. You will not find any that disputes a second-century authorship.

<dd>The peer review crowd might have very definite motives for casting aspersions on a document that Jesus said should be carefully studied in the last days. The vision of the statue in Chapter 2 is most telling about the difference between Babylonian government (and her successors), and God's prophesied kingdom; It usually doesn't take too long to listen to the sermon of someone claiming to be Christian, to tell which "side" they are really rooting for in that struggle. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 03:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allen, the real issue here is that since they don't have any compelling proof whatsoever for Maccabean authorship, the only way they feel they can make their point is by resorting to these classically Goebbels-ian tactics of 1) discrediting all opposing views as 'insignificant', no matter how significant they really are (even when they are sourced in Matthew 24), and then 2) gaming the rules with strength of numbers in order to prevent these opposing viewpoints' evidence, and the fact that it is still regarded as canonical today, from even being mentioned. It's as though this tiny wikipedia board has declared the canon null and void and declared that their scholars' opinion, unproven theories and conjecture have now superceded the canon for everyone, because it is 'insignificant' in their estimation. You see, it's because they're really <i>afraid</i> of any evidence that opposes them being mentioned. If they had nothing to fear from Josephus being mentioned because they didn't think it mattered, trust me, they would have no problem with it. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 11:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't know why I bother with this, but are you really suggesting that modern scholars have no right to engage in critical scholarship of ancient authors, and to try to determine which of their claims a re credible or not? This kind of attitude is one basically hostile to the very idea of scholarship. Codex - are you really comparing us to Goebbels?

<dd>No, you've got it all wrong. It's a pity that as many times as I have explained my position clearly, you still seem to have it twisted. ONE... MORE... TIME... I am NOT questioning any modern scholars right to engage in critical scholarship, I just want ALL siginificant sides on scripture to be represented, not leaving ANY out for ANY reason. ANd the traditional view is significant, so wikipedia cannot take sides, even if you personally choose to. Isn't that simple enough? And yes actually , I do question a wikipedian editor's right to engage in research here on wikipedia. If you want to critically question a specific statement of Josephus or any primary source, please don't do it in your own name - find the same criticism in print somewhere. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This discussion was going sooo well. A pity that it should end here. If john k were construed as ending the discussion, indeed it might have ended. But I think it's appropriate to put things in perspective. Any Talk page consensus (or possibly Wiki arbitration) could block a revert by Codex Sinaiticus (with the blocked characters above). That's not overly demanding. Mechanisms are available for making progress. It only takes time, patience, and close attention to what is disputed and what is not. E.g., I believe that describing an argument in Biblical <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html#Technical_usages" title="Apologetics">apologetics</a> can be appropriate in a Wiki article. It can have cognitive value. Its quantity can be disputed in a particular article, but that's a different matter. It's not necessarily a matter of all or nothing. Someone else might dispute my belief. Maybe I'd persuade or be persuaded. Either way, it is possible to get a consensus that allows no single person to determine the outcome. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmeeks_4039.html" title="User:Thomasmeeks">Thomasmeeks</a> 01:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concerning the statement immediately below of User:Codex Sinaiticus (dated 01:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)), fortunately the "if" premise is obviously wrong (much more wrong than the misspelling of 'Goebbels' below). I was not trying to <b>ban</b> dissenting viewpoints but to maintain that <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html#Technical_usages" title="Apologetics">apologetical</a> arguments should <b>not be banned</b>. How much clearer could that be put? As to my preceding statement above, if any one or any group were in violation of Wikipedia policy, that would be wrong &amp; I'd oppose it. Codex Sinaiticus must have misunderstood my intent.

<p>Codex, you have to get away from the concept of "canon" or "not canon". What you say implies that if the Church says it's canon, it has some special status that must be respected by people who are not members of that Church. We have no say on what is canon, but neither do you have the right to use the book's status as canon to cite research that falls outside the realm of peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p>And Thomasmeeks, the answer is yes. We <b>are</b> more educated than people were 2000 years ago. We have the tools of archaeological research, historical-critical textual analysis, historical method, and scientific method at our disposal. The ancients did not. If you read the ancient Greek and Roman historians, you'll find that they have no concept of the difference between a primary and secondary source. If their predecessor said it, they either believe it or not purely on whether they think it sounds plausible. The ancients had a respect for the authority of tradition that most people today do not, and that is inherently contradictory to the scientific method and other foundations of modern research methods.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 04:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your "compromise" is completely unacceptable because it only mentions "Some conservative scholars" who believe Daniel wrote the book, and mentions nothing at all about the fact that the Christian churches who hold it canonical also unequivocally state that Daniel wrote the Book. This includes the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church that have many sources and scholars stating that Daniel wrote the book, with evidence. Some Western scholars may have stated otherwise, but even their Churches have as yet not dropped the book from their canons. And no, I am certainly not going to, as you said, "get away from the concept of 'canon' and 'not canon'. This is a vital concept, sorry you do not appreciate what it means, which clearly you do not. I am certainly not arguing that this means non-Christians are bound to respect the canon. But I am arguing that this is a crucial point that a neutral, balanced article cannot overlook while taking all significant sides and positions into account, and still claim to remain "neutral" (not taking any sides). So if you think the issue of canonicity is going to magically "go away" because you just told it to, you're dreaming. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 11:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine. "Conservative scholars and many Protestant and Eastern Churches, and some Orthodox Jews." I never had the word "some" in there. The issue of evidence won't be addressed because what you think constitutes evidence would be laughed at if you sent it in for peer review and you refuse to let us put in evidence for the other position unless we put in yours.</p>
<p>And the Catholic Church has no position on the authorship of Daniel. It will not drop the book from the canon because historical accuracy is no longer necessary for it to maintain a book in the canon. Its position on infallibility refers to doctinal matters only; it has explicitly stated that the first chapter of Genesis, for example, is not literally true.</p>

<dd>I would be very interested to see exactly where the Roman Catholic Church 'explicitly stated that the first chapter of Genesis... is not literally true'... Not that I'm doubting your claim, I would just find the actual text of where they stated this very useful, if you have it... We seem to be getting somewhere with your compromise wording, but the past tense ("The traditional view WAS") is clearly wishful thinking, do you think maybe you could change that to "is"? Also since there is a lot of evidence, instead of running from it, I would not object to having a subarticle dedicated to the Dating of Daniel to explore all the evidence, as long as it is fair and not exclusive to one pov. Many people have debated the authorship and dating of this book over the centuries, but nobody has really proved anything conclusively, so we can't have a litmus test like 'Only those who agree with theory X are the true Bible scholars, because they all agree with each other and so they are peer reviewed, but those who hold to theory Y are just a bunch of cranks outside of true biblical scholarship.' That is the very meaning of forcing a partisan, non-neutral view on the article. We cannot take any sides, we just present everybody's view and most importantly, we don't exclude evidence that we don't like, just because it does not support our position. That will go a long way to solving this POV travesty. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rob117, I'm glad we're agreed on the first 4 sentences of para. 2 above (04:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC) edit). If the ancients did not distinguish between primary &amp; 2ndary sources, this would not be a big disadvantage with only one source (or many sources all of which they reported). If you're saying they relied only on authority or plausibility, what's changed today is only what is factored into those terms (such as primary vs, 2ndary). One reason we have their accounts might be that they survived. To have survived they may have had good survival instincts, possibly the same instincts at work in Wiki edits. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmeeks_4039.html" title="User:Thomasmeeks">Thomasmeeks</a> 02:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We need to work out a compromise so that the article is not one-sided and presents all significant points of view. This is not negotiable, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a cornerstone of policy. Here is the way the section formerly read before it was hacked:</p>
<p><i>Traditionally, the Book of Daniel was believed to have been written by its namesake during and shortly after the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_captivity.html" title="Babylonian captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> in the sixth century BC. A significant number, though far from all, in the Judeo-Christian tradition continue to believe this today. In this point of view, the book is a work of divinely-inspired prophecy which correctly predicts book's content and world events for at least 400 years after its original composition.</i></p>
<p><i>While Orthodox Jewish and some Christian scholars still assert this as a realistic date, a considerably later writing or <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redaction.html" title="Redaction">redaction</a> is widely held on the basis of historical and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textual_analysis.html" title="Textual analysis">textual analysis</a>. In this view, except for possible minor glosses, the book reached its final form around 164 BC (Hartman and Di Lella, 1990, p. 408; Towner, 1993, p. 151). This gave the events that had already occurred during the fifth to second centuries BC the appearance of prophecies. The later date of composition explains why from 11:39 on, the prophecies fail to track accurately later events in the reign of Antiochus IV.</i></p>
<p><i>John Collins finds it impossible for the "court tales" portion of Daniel to have been written in second Century BC due to textual analysis. In his <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a></i> Anchor Bible Dictionary <i>entry for the Book of Daniel, he states "it is clear that the court-tales in chapters 1-6 were not 'written in Maccabean times'. It is not even possible to isolate a single verse which betrays an editorial insertion from that period."</i></p>
<p>Just because you hold the opposite POV does not give anyone license to cut it out of the article. That is called "POV pushing" and will not be tolerated. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Six sucessive reverts of the article follow by the above person and me (with Edit summaries indicated at the history tab for the article).</li>
<li>The above person posts a NPOV template for the article.</li>

<p>In the authorship and date section, we simply state:</p>
<p>"Traditionally the book was believed to have been written by its namesake in the sixth century BC; conservative scholars accept this dating. Non-confessional scholars and liberal religious scholars, however, date it to the second century BC."

<dd>Clever of your friend to orphan this section from your friend's reply to it. Still, it concedes more than is necessary. Coming at it from other side, a problem with the above is that most (small-m) "mainstream" scholars who might not accept the liberal label agree with the above. "Many mainline Protestant and Catholic scholars" would have the advantage of accuracy and specificity especially with cited references. 2ndarily, this is mostly agreed to in sections 26 and 19, bottoms.

<p>The long-standing wording is "Whereas almost all scholars conclude a second century dating of the book..." or minor variations thereof. This was recently changed by an anonymous IP to "...many scholars...", without discussion. I reverted this, whereupon I was reverted in turn by user "Codex Sinaiticus". This new wording fails to convey the fact that 2nd-century authorship is the mainstream scholarly position. I'd settle for "most", but "many" seems insufficient.

<dd>Since there is already a serious pov-pushing issue with this article, the more neutral and less pov-pushing wording would be preferable. Most is fair enough, though, no need for 'almost all'. The fact is that this is such a hot Christian topic there are entire e-mailing lists, books, magazines, websites, any media you care to name, devoted entirely to various modern interpretations of the words in Daniel. The article is eventually going to have to aknowledge this reality. The so-called 'mainstream scholarly' view is one of the significant views, but it cannot claim a monopoly. As with other important Biblical articles, the views of all the various significant denominations on this topic should be alloted space, and labeling them 'sectarian' here just to exclude them is not productive and does not follow the pattern of other articles on wikipedia eg <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can see, the article <i>already does</i> acknowledge that there are Christians who disagree with the later dating. However, this particular sentence refers specifically to the opinions of <i>scholars</i>, before discussing a rather technical subject (the unity, or otherwise, of its authorship). The comparison with <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> doesn't seem relevant, as there isn't a "Book of Abraham" that has been dated by scholars to several centuries after its claimed date. A better comparison would be with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a>, or the various Gospel articles, where the critical mainstream scholarly positions are described. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 15:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I've calmed down a bit. Basically, the problem with this article is that it doesn't actually describe the Book of Daniel at all, or, at least, that this is only done incidentally. It's just a series of arguments and counterarguments between conservatives and mainstream scholars. This is absurd. The whole thing needs to be rewritten, and the w hole business should have a less prominent position.</p>
<p>The article should aim to first describe the content of the Book - what it says, the story provided, the prophecies made. Only once this is accomplished should it get into historical analysis. At that point, the traditional understanding of Daniel should be made clear, but there's no need to discuss it at length, because the traditional understanding is basically to take the Book's stories and claims as given. This can be followed by a discussion of modern scholarly understandings, including the reasons why the prophecies are generally considered to be from the Maccabean period, the intepretation generally given by scholars to the prophecies, any debates that may exist over the dating of the "court tales" portion of the book, and so forth. The issue of supposed historical inaccuracies in the court tales portion should only be touched on briefly - for instance, all we should say about Darius the Mede is that there is no clear reference to such a figure outside of Daniel, that traditionalists have generally tried to identify him with various other figures, and that scholars tend to view his presence as evidence of a relatively late date of the book. And such like. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a reference to Darius the Mede in Josephus though... Actually I am not opposed to a rewrite, but let's continue to refine it slowly, one edit at a time and not cut out the whole thing in one swoop edit...

<dd>Josephus doesn't count as an independent source when he's discussing stuff from the Persian era and before. He's just following the Bible. At least, this is the consensus of most scholars that I'm aware of. So I should have said, "there is no clear <i>independent</i> reference to such a figure outside of Daniel." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting template for change suggested by john k above, though as noted, hard to do without consensus. One start would be to flag all challenged statements to meet <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> policy. <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> has tips for shortening and maintaining balance. Unreferenced, challenged statements would be subject to closer scrutiny &amp; tougher standards. Key is listening hard to whatever is said, no matter who says it. If one can't see something through someone else's eyes, it may come down to counting heads, but one hopes that proposing acceptable standards (if only implicitly after the fact) would be sufficient. Proposing standards, such as above for peer reviewed research has merit. The sources should reliable, authoritative, etc. Right now IMHO 40KB, though long, is not excessive <i>iff</i> it is all meaty and beautifully written. One should aim to be <i>as precise as</i> supporting materials allow but not <i>more so</i> (a kind of POV). Consulting standard sources IMHO is an excellent control. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmeeks_4039.html" title="User:Thomasmeeks">Thomasmeeks</a> 01:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Part of the problem as it currently stands is that there's a lot of arguments being made that are essentially, so far as I can tell, Codex's own interpretations of primary sources. For instance, on the claim about Astyages, my fact tag was replaced by a reference to Bible verses. But the issue isn't what the Septuagint says (at least, that isn't the main issue). The issue is whether anyone has actually made this argument to demonstrate an early date for the Book of Daniel. There's tons of stuff like this in the article. Basically, I'm not so concerned if the article mentions the <i>fact</i> that traditional Christian and orthodox Jewish writers continue to hold to an early date for Daniel. Any specific arguments they have made that are specific to issues relating to the historical accuracy of Daniel are <i>maybe</i> worth mentioning, if they are particularly significant (I'm not sure how this is to be determined). What I really want out of here are a) original arguments for an early date made on the basis of Codex's (or whoever's - if anyone else did it, it would be just as bad) understanding of the Biblical text; b) inclusion of arguments for inerrancy that don't really pertain to Daniel specifically, but are just kind of generic arguments that could be applied to anything; and c) attempts to pretend that the broad consensus of mainstream secular, Jewish, protestant, and Catholic scholars that the book was written in the Maccabean period is in fact a phenomenon of "secular" scholars, and, generally, any attempt to claim the mantle of "Christianity" for what is, in fact, a rather small subset of Christian denominations. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 07:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You still don't seem to recognize that there is a vast, vast body of published opinion out there on this, the secondary sources are not few on interpretation of Daniel, and many defenses have been made of the 6th century BC date, even up to the present time. You can't just dismiss the massive historiography of this, or insinuate that I am making it up myself, just because you think that only the (relatively recent) authors who have decided on a 2nd century date, with scant to no evidence, are the only ones who "count"; and the other ones you seem to think don;t count, and should not even be mentioned, see <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damnatio_memoriae.html" title="Damnatio memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a>. That damnatio memoriae mentality is the enemy of building a neutral encyclopedia, and building a neutral encyclopedia is the enemy of that mentality. We don't just present those sources that back up our own position, and declare all the others "invalid". We present ALL the sources. ALL of them. And they ARE significant, even if you don't like the fact that they use real evidence instead of peer pressure. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the distaste for "recent" scholarship is one of the real issues here. You seem to think that St. Jerome and Martin Luther, or whoever, are appropriate sources on Biblical scholarship. Somehow, this kind of argument only comes up in religious examples. We don't consider Ptolemy or Galileo to be reliable sources on astronomy, we don't consider Aristotle or Darwin to be reliable sources on biology, we don't consider Leopold von Ranke or Edward Gibbon to be reliable sources on history. The whole point of this endeavor is to provide the most accurate account of a modern understanding of a subject, not to quote obsolete authorities. The arguments made by obsolete authorities may or may not be significant to an article, but they are not to be treated in the same way as the writings of present day scholars. In terms of the defenses of the 6th century date made at the present time, I think an analysis of the qualifications of those making the claim is in order. As yet, Codex hasn't really brought forward any specific examples of people outright defending a 6th century date. Or, at least, if he has, I don't recall what they are, and it was a long time ago. The material I have encountered is all from Biblical inerrantist polemicists - pastors of fundamentalist churches, teachers at fundamentalist seminaries, and the like. I don't see how the fact that such people defend an early date for Daniel is particularly significant in its own right to a discussion of Daniel. These people are Biblical inerrantists. They believe that <i>everything</i> in the Bible is literally true. That they believe this also of Daniel hardly seems that significant. I will leave aside for now the question of whether the specific arguments they make should be in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:20, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You've still got it all wrong, my alleged "distaste for recent scholarship" is NOT the real issue, because I'm not the one trying to keep any material out of the article; I want the complete story (both sides) to be told, not just half.

<dd>A peer reviewed article that argued for an early date for the Book of Daniel would of course be acceptable. I'm sure other sources could be imagined. If you would actually present some sources, perhaps we could get somewhere in evaluating if they are appropriate or not. As it stands, no sources are provided for the argument that the book comes from the 6th century. There've been some sources cited on the identity of Darius the Mede, but their qualifications remain unclear. I would suggest that anyone commenting on the subject would have to, at the very least, be competent in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic to be considered a worthwhile source. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That should be no problem! Haven't you even looked any of this stuff up? I can't believe how many pro-6th century sources I just found that discuss the question of Xenophon's "Cyaxares II" alone! There is a vast literature out there, this is one of the most studied books in history and many positions has been taken by scholars of many stripes; questions of prophecy interpretation are tricky and are rarely a matter of 'unified consensus' as much as you might wish. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Codex, two points. Firstly, it is not enough for you to simply state that there is a vast literature out there. You have to actually tell us what it is. Secondly, just because a book has been written, that does not mean it is necessarily an appropriate source for us to cite, so some details on the publisher, the credentials of the author, and so forth, are also useful. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have some hope that going about it this way may clarify things.
