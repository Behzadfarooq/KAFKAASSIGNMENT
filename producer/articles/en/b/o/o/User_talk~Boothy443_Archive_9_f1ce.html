<p>Sadly, this is not a change that can be done under the speedy process; it's an acronym expansion, but not a country one. You'll need to put it through the normal CfD process.

<p>Some advice from a much older person -- POV is in the eye of the beholder -- do not allow yourself to be manipulated by censors like Demiurge, etc. even with accusations re sockpuppets, which, even if they exist, are expressly <b>not</b> prohibited by Wikipedia, unless they've changed the rules, or "vandal", a subjective term used by Demiurge or whomever to shut someone up that they don't agree with.</p>
<p>And don't waste your time threatening me with 3rr; it won't stop me from telling the truth about the Irish in Scotland, Britain or anywhere else.</p>

<li>Robert - try working *with* other editors instead of constantly reverting to your own brand of POV.

<p>If no articles existed at the changed links, then why was it necessary to rv??</p>
<p>Also, your calling me a bigot is a badge of honour for me b/c that is what the Irish always call anyone who disagrees with them or who dares to criticize them or show their ugly and brutal history. It's a good tactic, used by the likes of Cardinal Spellman (the American Pope), among others to silence critics, but that is just soooo 20th century. This is the 21st century.</p>
<p>What is more I don't feel like being criticized by someone who was brought up on arbitration and been deemed guilty by his peers of:</p>
<p>a) edit warring b) violations of 3RR. c) alienation with Wikipedia's administrative structure and dispute resolution d) [f] ailure ... to participate in dispute resolution in good faith</p>

<p>Just to let you know, I reverted to a previous version by the IP Author. He seems to have added a lot of good information, then changed it all for a skewed POV view, which has no basis (the same reason was made months ago and removed for the same reason).

<p>Hi. I've just picked up a revert on a recent edit in which a beer was moved into a brewery. This is an ongoing (and almost complete) procedure which is taking place on all isolated beers. If you feel there is a case for keeping beers brewed by a brewery apart from the brewery itself it might be worth your while bringing the matter up at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Beer_8c19.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer</a> for discussion. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 18:02, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again. The merging of beer brands into brand holders or breweries is a process that has been taking place for a while now by various members of the Wiki beer project. Your activity is against the trend. Please, if you feel that the process is wrong either in an individual case, or as a general policy, then raise the issue on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Beer_8c19.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Beer</a> to get consensus. Your revertions at this point might be considered vandalism. I will, again, undo what you have done. Please do not revert again until the matter has been discussed and resolved. If, after discussion, it is felt that your view is the proper one, then there will be no conflict - at the moment we have conflict. I hope you will do the right thing and move toward avoiding conflict rather than getting into a revert war. Cheers. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 07:31, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First off their is no stated policy of such on the the project page, nor has their been any discussion on the project page in regards to this issue either. Also these article require that a merge tag be placed on the articles in question that that discussion take place, none of which has been done. Their for as long as you continue to force the merge of these pages i will simply have to revert you. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 07:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Had a look at the section. The paragraph seems to concentrate on cartoons, which seems to be a bit trivial to me, although highly visible. Certainly, in the 19th century the Irish in America werre disliked as dirty, violent and Catholic (Protestantism was big part of American identity at the time). The Klu Klux Klan was very anti-Irish at this time, there were also several "nativist" societies who were dedicated to stopping Irish immigration. This might be a more fruitfull area for the paragraph to explore. In the mid 19th century, there was a spate of burnings of Irish Catholic churches in New York, which was stopped when Archbishop <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hughes_%28archbishop%29_bbe5.html" title="John Hughes (archbishop)">John Hughes (archbishop)</a> threatened to burn parts of New York in reprisal! (His exact words were, "to make New York another Moscow" -in reference to the burning of that city in 1812). I think these are the kind of issues the article should really deal with. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorney_3c50.html" title="User:Jdorney">Jdorney</a> 11:59, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah right. I didn't get that before. The present wording looks ok to me. Arguably the computerised search thing is original research though and should be deleted, but I thinks its ok to say that historians disagree over how much discrimination the Irish faced at that time. My concern wold be that narrow focus of the section. I would suggest that hte nativist v immigrant angle is more important. However I wouldn't claim that any special knowledge on the subject. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorney_3c50.html" title="User:Jdorney">Jdorney</a> 11:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boothy, thanks for leaving your comments. I understand your complaint and I will not mark the Irish university infobox as depricated without further discussion at specific noticeboards and will personally notify you about before any depopulating/delisting or listing at TFD. However you should know that many of the individuals involved with creating the country specific pages were aware of the issue and some were involved with standardizing the template.

<p>Isn't it about time some participants got blocked for their constant reverts without any explanations whatsoever? Over and over it is stressed that they need to be NPOV and unbiased and they will not follow Wikipedia policy. This is beyond content dispute; this is utter disregard for our rules. I have tried to be as civil was possible, gently explaining policy to these noobs and noting how they need to argue to make their point.

<p>I took a look at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> article, and twiddled with the "Cultural Identity" section a bit. I mainly did a little rewording, some Wikifying, and added a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag regarding Lincoln during the Civil War, as I think a reference point there would be helpful.

<p>Look, don't take the whole typo thing personally; it's not as if I dislike you or anything, it's just that grammar is a particular sticking point for me. I was glad to see that even you have recognized that WillC is not conducting himself in a responsible manner. You have repeatedly accused me of vandalism, but I just don't think that what I've done could be described as vandalism.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, all of my information was cited. I would sincerely like you to write on my talk page and tell me why you think I've vandalized the Maryland article. We may disagree, but we can still be professional. And any differences aside, we <b>both know</b> that what WillC is doing is contrary to Wikipedia values by reverting whole sections of cited facts even as debate is ongoing.

<p>The poll you put back in is unreliable. It only has data from presidential elections. It also has no information as whether the people polled were 100% Irish Catholics, or people who just claimed some Irish ancestry.</p>
<p>In say that Irish Catholics vote 50-50 is POV because the only source is for a presidential election. You need to have sources from local political elections. That is more important than national politics in determing if someone is republican or democrat. The poll Richard Jensen is promoting has no data from any local elections. It is unreliable and does not belong on wikipedia because it does not have all the facts.</p>
<p>Also, Ed Gillispie is the former RNC chairman, and why should he be mentioned and not the 13 or so Irish Catholic DNC chairmen? 75.3.4.54 18:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why do you allow stuff that is obviously untrue into the Irish American article. How can one poll from the 2004 presidential election determine how all Irish Catholics have voted in every election since 1968. If you read what you keep reverting to you should see that is what it says and if you checked the source, you would see it was only from one election. The only reason for you wanting to keep that in is because you would have to have an anti-Irish Catholic bias. 75.3.4.54 22:14, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:TallahasseeFL.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

<p>Sorry, but if <i>any</i> text copied from another website appears in a Wikipedia article—no matter how slight—and the original writer of that text has not given his/her permission for that text to be on Wikipedia under the GFDL, it <i>is</i> a copyright violation and it must be removed. Simply removing the offending text in a regular edit does not fix the problem, as the copyright violation would still be in the page history. <span style="border: 2px solid #ba0000;"> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenelson83_2b5d.html" title="User:Denelson83">Denelson</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenelson83_28f5.html" title="User talk:Denelson83"><b>83</b></a> </span> 19:47, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wanted to come here to remove this message, replace it with an apology and then remove that. But the truth is I have added to the article, and in the past, not in this cast, I have seen situations where RJensen would remove one line for an unexplained reason, and I would have to add it back in. You'll see this in last changes, but I will remove all of this from your talk page. Thank you. 75.3.15.49 05:25, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's one vote against. Now, listen, those stations belong in those templates. They serve the areas one way or another. It is also removal of fact, templates should reflect certain facts -- like cable carraige, if a station is widely carried on cable within a market (Pittsburgh stations in Johnstown/Altoona), then it should be listed. But if it is on cable with a certain part of the DMA (NY stations and Philly stations in market border areas), then it should not be listed.
