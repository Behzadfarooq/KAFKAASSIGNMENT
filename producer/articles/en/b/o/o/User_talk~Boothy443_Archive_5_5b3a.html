<p>Boothy, just a friendly reminder that you need to be careful about violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. While doing RC patrol, I stumbled upon <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Chase%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_266b.html" title="Fox Chase, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Fox Chase, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, and noticed that you had reverted four times in less than 24 hours. In the future, please don't do this, unless it is a clear-cut case of simple vandalism.

<dd>This would go for all the Philadelphia sections. Please discuss those changes on the talk page and do not violate 3RR.

<dd>Boothy, please don't do that one more time. While I see your side, it really doesn't matter whether the redirect is "right" or "wrong"- <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> clearly states that <b>no</b> revert is allowed after 3 reverts in a 24 hour time period, unless it is simple vandalism or self-reverts. I urge you to stop reverting and leave the editors who are reverting you a note in order to resolve your differences. If you continue to violate 3RR, I <b>will</b> block you.

<dd>So, just to make sure I understand, you want the box where the flag and seal are to have only the seal (as in the current invocation), only the flag, both, or none - all depending on the presence of the "flag" and "seal" parameters? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 04:07, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

Having an article called "Trenton Rail Station" is a perfect example. <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenton.html" title="Trenton">Trenton</a> is a disambiguation page because there are many places called Trenton. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 07:29, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess that works, though that station wasn't always the main one in Trenton.

<p>Until around <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, the Northeast Corridor between Trenton and Monmouth Junction was not built - instead the main line went along the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_and_Raritan_Canal_c524.html" title="Delaware and Raritan Canal">Delaware and Raritan Canal</a>. <a href="http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/TRENTON/Trenton_Dripps_1849.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/TRENTON/Trenton_Dripps_1849.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> shows the old station.

<dd>Yeah, that was bad timing on Jimbo's part. I think the only reason he removed the link was because it disables the computer temporarily (very difficult to close all the windows, may have to restart the computer).

<p>Greetings. I'd like to ask you why you have links to shock sites on your toolbox. I know you know that they upset quite a few people, some of whom know what they are and some of whom don't. I don't know if you give any value to my opinion, but I'd like to ask you to take them off, for the same reason that I'd ask anyone who has content deliberately intended to shock, offend, or insult other users to remove it from their userpage. I believe it's detrimental to Wikipedia when someone has such things in their userspace, because it seems like a deliberate insult to everyone in the community who will come across it. I find it hard to work with someone who has stated the desire for me to "piss off", and by having that link it your user space it seems as if you're saying that to everyone. You make a lot of good contributions to Wikipedia, but things like this make it difficult for others to work with you despite that, and we are a community to build an encyclopedia, not just a bunch of people working alone who never come in contact with each other.</p>
<p>I'm not going to remove it from your page, but I'd really appreciate it if you would do so yourself. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 03:35, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know it is a rare honour to get an RFA support vote from you. I am not quite sure what to make of it, since I have no clue why you supported me of all candidates. I have only ever come across you when checking out RFAs, and that gives a very incomplete picture. In fact, some of the comments in the current RFC on you suggest that your development as an editor was not entirely unlike mine (I don't know what to say there since you didn't provide your own perspective). I am impressed that you can continue doing good work while being the target of hostility from your fellow editors, and I hope you will find to a somewhat more communicative mode of operation in the future (except for the RFA, it worked for me). Anyhow, thanks for your vote, and good luck! <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 10:35, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>but have been plagued with an admin who is harrassing me, and another editor who clearly has no NPOV on the subject he is writing about- he has links to the person he is editing about on his own website.They play music together, and the editor in question is a promoter for the subject in question. The subject is Biff Rose. Fcello has placed a block on the page. It needs it, but everytime the talk page temp page gets close to something resembling a compromise, invariably my edits are erased, as those of others who are disagree with the general tone of the article... and it all starts over again. I've also been contacted by two friends who have been banned because they're edits were in the same vein as my own. One is Bag of Donuts, and another is Mmmmmmbo. Both have opinions similar to mine. Am I talking with the right person? thanks even if I'm not.

<p>I don't really know where to begin the discussion of the categorization of the bridges on the east coast. I have posted on individual category talk pages before, but I received no response. There are far too many toll bridge categories with one or two articles. These make it impossible to look at the list of bridges in a particular state. Even though it makes more categories for each particular article, I think it is cleaner to included each toll bridge article in Cat:Bridges in &lt;state&gt;, Cat:Toll roads in &lt;state&gt;. I also don't believe that "category:bascule bridges" should be broken down to basclue bridges by state. At some point all the divisions make the category meaningless. I have read <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> thorougly before comming to these conlusions. Let me know what your opinion is. Thanks! <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacophony_1b6a.html" title="User:Cacophony">Cacophony</a> 03:57, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good example of this is Category:Toll roads in Illinois. There is a category for Toll Bridges in Illinois when there is only one article in that category. Why not just add it to toll roads in Illinois, and bridges in Illinois, so that those categories aren't broken up? <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacophony_1b6a.html" title="User:Cacophony">Cacophony</a> 04:07, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I even changed my user page to just say I was in Minnesota, but a couple days ago I decided I might as well contribute to the Rochester and Mayo articles and took a few photographs.

<p>I quote: "Another way to define a stub is that an article so incomplete that an editor who knows little or nothing about the topic could improve its content after a superficial internet search or a few minutes in a reference library is quite probably a stub. One that can only be improved by a rather knowledgeable editor, or after significant research, may not be a stub."</p>
<p>The routeboxes cam mostly be coded with information that is available on most state DOT sites or exit list sites. Most of this information is already in the article itself. Also, <b>it is the general consensus of those who are involved with road WPs that these articles that do not follow their respective WP standards are considered stubs.</b></p>
<p>Simply put, I also do not have the time to go through all 200 articles and remove the tag.

<p>Hi. I deliberately changed Jane Gazzo's Dream Ticket article which I wrote originally, to a textual "Dream Ticket" in the BBC 6 Music page because Jane is leaving the show at the end of September and someone else will be coming in. I wanted to preserve her version of the show before the new host takes over. So I left the article "Jane Gazzo's Dream Ticket" hooked off her "Jane Gazzo" article for posterity as it was, and made a textual "Dream Ticket" line. I will be making a new "Dream Ticket" article based on any new format. So I will revert it back to the plain text and then add another article, or just leave it as plain text ("Dream Ticket") as is the style of the other show names. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiklrsc_e9c8.html" title="User:Wikiklrsc">Wikiklrsc</a> 22:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You reverted an edit of mine for the Martin J.O'Malley article. If you had bothered to examine the original, it would (or should) have been clear to you that it was just POV propaganda. I will contact the administrators to make sure the O'Malley article is cleared of all POV comments.</p>

<p>Hi dude</p>
<p>Where are you getting the information that South Dublin and Fingal are couties surrounding Kildare?</p>
<p>Dublin is a county. South Dublin and Fingal are not. They are merely administrative regions within the county of Dublin. Another example of this is the county of Tipperary. It has 2 administrative regions: Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding.</p>
<p>Do you understand this explaination?</p>

<p>Thanks - I appreciate the response! I wasn't so much as asking why you opposed my RfA (I'm sure you have good reasons, as you appear to take some time to evaluate each candidate&#160;:)) - I was just wondering what I could improve upon (such as "use more edit summaries", "not around long enough - need more experience" or something similar)&#160;:). You don't have to respond of course, but I'd consider it helpful if you could give me something to work on!

<p>I notice that you went through and voted on all the pending RfAs this morning, and you opposed the majority of them. However, none of your votes had any comment (not even the word "Support" or "Oppose"). The RfA guidelines say <i>please include a short explanation of your reasoning, particularly when opposing a nomination.</i> It would be very helpful if you'd give your reasoning in each case! - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 13:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't really have much to say, but isn't it funny that people <i>keep</i> coming to you to ask for your reasons for voting the way you do on RfA? I may not totally agree with all of your oppose votes, but you are entitled to your opinion and your vote. Do they (the BCrats) really disregard your votes? Well, I guess that's all.

<p>Hi, I also have the same question as the Johntex above. If you have the time could you please tell me why, and I recommend giving reasons on the RfA page itself so that other users can take your critique into account when they. It would also help me better know what I have to do in order to improve. I think this is important especially since you're not a user I've dealt with too often before.

<dd>Yes, I figured it was something along those line, however what I was trying to get at is what you think I would have to change in order to become qualified. Whether I become admin or not having those qualities would no doubt be important and I would think if I do become admin you would want to help influence me to become a user you see fit to be an admin.
