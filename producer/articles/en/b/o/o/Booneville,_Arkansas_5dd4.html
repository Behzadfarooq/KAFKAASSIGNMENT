<p>One of the oldest towns in western Arkansas, Booneville was founded about 1828, when Walter Cauthron built a log cabin and opened a general mercantile store near the Petit Jean River in what was then Crawford County. According to Cauthron family tradition, the intended to name the settlement Bonneville, in honor of his friend Captain <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Bonneville_e2c0.html" title="Benjamin Bonneville">Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville</a>, with whom he shared an interest in exploring the Arkansas Territory. However an error in spelling resulted in the recording of the name as Booneville.</p>
<p>Another story says that the town was named for frontiersman <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Boone_e1f1.html" title="Daniel Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, who settled in southern <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> in his later life. He was a good friend of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Logan_bada.html" title="Benjamin Logan">Benjamin Logan</a>, a soldier and politician from Shelby County, Kentucky. Col. James B. Logan, 1791-1859, for which <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_County%2C_Arkansas_df5e.html" title="Logan County, Arkansas">Logan County</a> gets its name, was a member of this same family. Logan was a member of Arkansas's first state legislature. He is buried in the Logan Family Cemetery, near Sugar Grove, Arkansas (a few miles west of Booneville).</p>
<p>In 1898, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, later acquired by the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Island_Railroad_f389.html" title="Rock Island Railroad">Rock Island Railroad</a>, constructed a line between McAlister, OK and Little Rock, that passed through Booneville. For the next seventy-five years, the railroad was a major factor is the town's economy.</p>

<p>From its early days, Booneville has supported education. In 1874, as a response to needs for higher learning in western Arkansas, the Fort Smith District of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Episcopal_Church%2C_South_944d.html" title="Methodist Episcopal Church, South">Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>, authorized the establishment of the Fort Smith District High School in Booneville, forty miles to the west. Local church members donated the land, building materials and labor. The school, located on South College Street, was to be supported by student tuitions. Students came from towns all over western Arkansas to board with Booneville families and attend a school that offered an advanced curriculum, including Latin, German, advanced mathematics, literature and music. The school functioned until the early 1900s.</p>
<p>After the school closed, a group of residents and business leaders formed the Booneville Education Association and acquired nine acres of land in the northwest part of town. The new school was called the Booneville Co-Educational Institute and also offered a more advanced curriculum than the public school around. Graduates were admitted as <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophomores.html" title="Sophomores">sophomores</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arkansas_at_Fayetteville_427a.html" title="University of Arkansas at Fayetteville">University of Arkansas at Fayetteville</a>. In 1920, state funds were made available for the support of public high schools and the school's property was transferred to the Booneville school system. The building continued to be used as the city's high school until a new building was built in 1929. The old Co-Educational Institute building was used as the Booneville elementary school for several decades after that.</p>

Once fully established, the sanatorium was the relocation center for all white Arkansans with tuberulosis. By the time the facility was closed in 1972, it had treated over 70,000 patients. The main hospital, named the Nyberg Building after Leo E. Nyberg, a former sanatorium patient and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_legislator.html" title="State legislator">state legislator</a> who sponsored the bill funding the construction, was completed in 1941. The facility became known worldwide as one of the most successful and modern hospitals for the treatment of tuberculosis of its day.</p>
<p>The sanatorium complex was self-sustaining, with dormitories, staff entertainment buildings, a chapel, laundry, dairy, water treatment plant, independent telephone system, and even a fire department. At the height of its use, the complex employed nearly 300 staff members. At one point, the total population of the center was greater than that of Booneville, in the valley below.</p>
<p>With the introduction of more effective drug therapy, the patient population began to decline. Eventually the sanatorium was closed in 1973. The campus is currently used as the Booneville Human Development Center, a state-run residential program for adults with mild and moderate <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_retardation.html" title="Mental retardation">mental retardation</a> and other <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developmental_disabilities.html" title="Developmental disabilities">developmental disabilities</a>.</p>
