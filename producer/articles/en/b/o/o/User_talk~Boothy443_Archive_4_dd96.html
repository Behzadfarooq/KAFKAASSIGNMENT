<p>Boothy443, thank you for your contributions to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>! In addition, thanks for your interest in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a>. However, in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a>, we usually place a reason for voting oppose to a user. Otherwise, the vote may not be taken seriously by the Wiki-munity (is that a word?). Would you mind either placing a reason for your opposition for every RfA or withdrawing your votes?

<p>I believe <a href="../../../d/i/t/User%7EDittoboy_8652.html" title="User:Dittoboy">Dittoboy</a> isn't really <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeM_9a56.html" title="User:JoeM">JoeM</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dittoboy seems to be trying to get himself <b>blocked</b>. JoeM is working hard on trying to get himself <b>unblocked</b>.</li>
<li>Dittoboy does his work from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Ilan_University_5c2b.html" title="Bar Ilan University">Bar Ilan University</a>, at IP address 132.70.50.117. (This I know because <b>he</b> keeps getting it blocked.) JoeM's record DOES have an IP address - 4.247.194.236.</li>
<li>I don't think JoeM knows anything about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>; Dittoboy shows some knowledge in the matter.</li>
<li>JoeM only has one sockpuppet going at a time; Dittoboy did his vandalism both before and after the sockpuppet <a href="../../../w/e/_/User%7EWe_want_FREEDOM_6d05.html" title="User:We want FREEDOM">We want FREEDOM</a>.</li>
<li>Most of Dittoboy's vandalism had <b>nothing</b> to do with JoeM's POV edits or with him trying to get unblocked. Dittoboy has been trying a few methids of getting blocked, and he finally found one which will work indefinitely.</li>
<li>If Dittoboy already had a blocked account, he wouldn't have needed do vandalise from his Dittoboy account. JoeM has several.</li>

<p>I realise you want us to leave you alone about this, but be aware that as you have not explained <i>why</i> you are voting against all admin candidates (no matter who they are), I would suggest to you that you don't act suprised when people a) message you about it, b) find that your vote is being discounted, and c) feel that perhaps you are disrupting Wikipedia to make a point. In your archives, I also notice that you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why is is that you, adminstrators specificaly and other useres, only confront users that vote in oppsition, i see a majority of votes for support with no explnation what so ever, yet no one questions them why they voted in support, and when most resons for support are give they are things like "i think he will do a good job", or "i have had no problems with the user in the past", or "because so and so voted oppose". yet an oppsition supporter basiclay is forced to write war and peace to explain why they voted no or else they are basisicaly left to felt like their vote is discounted. So no you dont need to know why i voted oppose, only that i voted oppose.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry, but we do in fact need to know why you voted to oppose. Voting to oppose implies that you have a problem with that editor's behaviour, or some aspect of his/her actions on this website. If that is the case, then we need to know why this is. Supporting, on the other hand, implies by its very nature that the person voting has no issues with the editor and feel that they would make a fine candidate. This also means that they don't have to justify why they are voting to support! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:05, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>First</b>, i never said that i wanted to be left alone on the subject, i juest perfer that if you are going to you the talk page for may account that you use it to address me and not other useres, and that if you feel the need to convers with other useres that you take it to your or their or a corsponding article talk page, and not converse on the talk page for my account.</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Second</b>, no i would not be and i was not supprised that i was being msg on account of my votes, or find that my vote is being discounted as it seems to be a valid and established, and very much disappointing and disconcering pratice no matter what level of user that one is,</dd>
<dd><b>Third</b>,"perhaps you are disrupting Wikipedia to make a point", so apprently this afferms the ideal of the admins that if you go aginst the grain, no matter how you do it, you are being distrupting, so a simple vote in oppose is distruptive then, well then thats sad that one can not oppose something in a civil way and be labled as distruptive, and as for making a point, what was the point being made other then i opposed their nominations, which seems to be a frowned upon practice, espicaly if i am being lectured by many "admins, without them saying it directly, that it's a bad and fround upon ideal to oppose a "admin" nomination, i find that more distruptive then my actions to express my idea of a canadite "admin". Since i doubt that any person on here can state what point, if any, i am trying to make make, your asseration in a subtle way is no more then with basis and without truth or fact, and i find this "accusation" highly offencive. And considering that daily users, both registered and un-regestered including many "admins", use this system as a way to express their political, religious, social, and other beliefs with little or no action taken aginst them is really the issue that you should focous on, rather then how someone has chose to vote for proposed "admins".</dd>
<dd><b>Fourth</b>, and no i do not need to give a reason, their is no policy that forces me to givae a reason for a vote, and if their is, or ever would be, i would recomend that all users stop voting on everything. They only person i have to justifiy my position towards is myself, if a canidate wishes to query me on my vote then only they should, as i see no need to explain my vote to any other users other then the ones it is directed towards, and even if they query me i still have every right and reson not to explain to them either. In the same way i dont need to explain how i vote to election authorities or the canidates after voting for my goverment respresenatives unless i feel so. How would you like it if in the next election, assuming that he runs, that John Howard or represenatives of the Labor Party were co call you up and demand or ask that you give a reason to why you vote for or aginst their goverment in the next elections, i dont know about you but i dont know if i would be to happy about it. And to say is that the RFA, among other things is anything less then an "election", though to even call it that is a stretch, is basicaly a joke. Also, assuming only makes an <b>ass</b> out of both <b>u</b> and <b>me</b>, the only thing that you infer is that i oppose a users apointment, and to infer any reasons why would just be useless and insulting to the canidate, to yourself, and me. It could mean that i dont approve of their behaviour, or that i dont belive they would be good as an admin, or that they dont have the skills, or they are not ready, or that they dont have ample expericne, or that i just dint like them, or i am voting because some one voted for, (a system that seems to be wildely employed and tolaratd/accepted in the RFA from both approve and oppose sides), or for some other various reason, and to assume the same from those that approve is just as useless.</dd>

<p>I plan no change in my system of how i vote, let alone if i vote for an "admin". No will i cave into this "bully" tatic that is being imposed aginst persons that act differently to the "admins".

<p>Hi Jason: Having looked at your edit history I think I understand why you voted oppose on all those candidates at once. I also think that you did so in response to what you consider to be failings by an individual admin and the administrators in general. Would you like me to elaborate my reasoning? This is not a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>Making your point in that way has distracted a significant number of editors from other aspects of improving the encyclopedia so it seems reasonable for TBSDY and others to deduce that you were disrupting Wikipedia to make a point. They may be mistaken but I do not think that they are being unreasonable. Similarly, it seems to me that by voting against so many RFAs simultaneously without explanation, you create the impression that you are expressing opposition to the process or the role rather than to individual candidates. This is akin to writing "none of the above" on your ballot slip—a spoilt ballot that would be disregarded in the kind of election to which you also allude. In this case, however, the process is not intended as a democratic vote (although the addition of tallies and the simplification of the format makes it look so—and what looks so becomes so) but is intended to be a debate to form consensus. I risk making donkeys of us both (smile) by assuming that you understand consensus. So here is the difficulty: Some people (including you it seems) perceive the process to be a democratic vote whilst others see it as a debate that uses a polling mechanism. The former requires no explanation and most democracies regard secrecy as a key element; the latter requires explanations of oppositions to the proposal so that the proposal can be modified or explained to increase consensus. The argument becomes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Contribute to the debate."</dd>
<dd>"I need not reveal my secret ballot."</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, it is no longer a conversation about the same thing.</p>
<p>I think that you do us all a disservice when you characterise this as a conflict between the admins and the rest of us. There is an existing process here. You chose to use it in an unusual way. A significant number of people asked for an explanation of this apparent anomaly with varying degrees of tact. Some of us have come to see that the initial volume of repeated questions could be seen as bullying even if that was not the intent. Nobody (and I repeat: nobody) has suggested that it is a bad thing to oppose RFAs. Reasoned opposition is to be encouraged because it helps other editors to look at the candidate more closely and enables the candidates to modify behaviours that are seen to be inappropriate. Support votes warm me but each comment and reasoned opposition would cause me to evaluate my behaviour and to seek to modify it. Many past candidates have stated how useful it was to receive criticism from their peers. In my opinion, an unexplained 'oppose' <i>should</i> attract questions; to do otherwise is to ignore that person's discomfort unless the candidature fails.</p>

<p>Boothy regarding your RFA votes both positive and negative, I've read your archives and I know how you feel and I feel the same way some days however I think you've made your point and am hoping that you will rethink your choice of not leaving reasons for votes both positive and negative. Leaving explanations helps nominated users see what they have to improve on to become a ""better editor"" {for lack of a more appropriate term of the top of my head) and may help other users in their decision whether to vote for or against the adminship of a user. I can perfectly understand if you disagree with. <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> 23:02, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If it takes a RFA to improve or crtiique a users edits, then everyone should automaticlay been given a nomination, so that way we can critique each other, but since it is a "vote" to determin if a user is qualified to be an admin, in which many are not, then i am no more compelled to gave a reson now then what i have been before. And i am not out to sway other users opinions in how they decide on if they belive if a person id deserving an "approval" of their nomination, in the same way i would hope, but seriously doubt is the case, that each user conduct their own research into a useres and not entierly rely on the "opnions" of a few users, lest we all are lemmings. So no i will not change my voting, nor will this constant naging of me to will change my opinion, other then it reenforces some of the many problems. As for proving my point, would you like to explain what the oint is that i am trying to make, becaus everyone says i am but no one can say what it is, and why it is such a problem, not that it would change my mind or anything. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 02:30, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>I know you have some qualms, if i am not mistaken, about the adminstration here, and if i am not correct you are or were an admin, just wondering what those qualms are if any.

<dd>The only qualm I have is with the arrogance and lack of humility of some admins. It's probably a minority, but a vocal one. For them, adminship has become a privileged class, no matter what the protestations to the contrary by this group. They tend to use phrases like "mop and bucket" and "no big deal", but balk at most discussion of any sort of adminship review (including <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFDA_5218.html" title="WP:RFDA">full de-adminship</a>). There is a double-standard which also applies to this group -- an unchecked <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude which unfairly elevates them. I've never used the phrase <i>cabal</i>, since I doubt this is a coordinated organizatio -- I just think that circumstances have put us into this situation over time.</dd>
<dd>Adminship (a bad name for the status, don't you think?) should be more freely given. There are a lot of admins that work very hard, and do some humbly. These are the ideal admins, and I'm sure there are more out there. I also think that an adminship review procedure is necessary for keeping that group's members humble. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:05, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)</dd>

Of course we may not agree on all matters, but I am certain that we can discuss matters rationally. I hope you are taking a Wikibreak (sometimes it does help to get away from Wikipedia for a bit) and have not left permanently.

<p>Hi Boothy: I appreciate you taking the time to vote on my RFA. Thank you. Since it was an oppose vote, I was wondering if you have any problems with me personally, or with the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> system in general, as indicated my your general pattern of voting. If your concerns are indeed with my positions or actions, I'd appreciate knowing them, since maybe I could try to address and fix any issues. It's kind of an opportunity for me to grow as a Wikipedian. Thanks for your time.

<p>Hi, I've decided to ask here anyway, since one of the goals of the project is to have talk pages where issues can be discussed. Can you explain why you have voted oppose for every current admin nomination except one? I have read your talk page archives, and I have never seen a response that actually addressed any of the issues involved. Given that the goal of RFAdminship is building and determining community consensus, I would like specific reasons for each. If you would like to know why other users have voted either support or oppose with no explanation ask them as you wish. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:24, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm just doing the rounds after my successful adminship promotion. But for you I've got something more involved than a cut-n-paste thank-you note. I have not seen an admin nomination yet that you did not oppose, and very few that you did not vote on at all.</p>

<p>Hi - I was actually kind of curious if I'd be an exception to your nearly universal NO vote. Would you find it amusing if I added "clearly a sheep vote" following your vote? I'm not entirely sure how you feel about what goes on around here, but I'm guessing (hoping, actually) that you are at least occasionally amused by some of the more flagrant absurdities. In any event, thanks for voting and I appreciate the support. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 14:39, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry you find so little humor here. Just to be clear, 1) I did not mean to imply I think your NO votes are not well reasoned. I have seen you in the past say the reasons for your votes are not anyone's business but your own and I completely respect this view, and 2) I think it's entirely obvious that your vote in this case is one of perhaps not very many that is clearly NOT a sheep vote, since many folks seem to think you automatically vote no. I'm not quite sure how to read your response ("sickened and disappointed" in general? or by my specific suggestion?), but in any event I interpret your response to mean you wish me not to add anything (so, of course, I won't). It appears that barring a major fluke I will be made an admin. If there's ever anything you need admin assistance with, please don't hesitate to ask. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 23:18, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your templates seem a little cleaner and more professional than the existing one. Before you make any changes, I'd mention it at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels</a>. It might seem academic as there are only two members of the project (one of them being me!), but the other user created the project to get the existing template on every channel article. I think he's done a lot of mop and bucket work with it, so might be a bit resistant at having to start again (although you do seem to have done much of the work already)!</p>
<p>In light of present circumstances, then, I'd at least mention it there before making mass changes to the articles. I'd support you. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 21:03, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that you've also ran into Dittoboy—he's the first and only time that I've had any of my user pages vandalized.

<p>As for my User page: There are several things that need to be done to help improve the health of the Wikipedia and the suggestion on that page is just one of them. Another thing that should be implemented is my <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_Merge_WikiProject_ideas_cdac.html" title="User:BlankVerse/Merge WikiProject ideas">Merge WikiProject</a> idea. On the other hand, I have neither the time nor stamina to fight the good fight. I'll put my ideas out there and if anyone else wants to run with them I will enthusiastically support them from the sidelines, but I will not be a major participant. As it is, I see myself cutting way back on any participation in the bureaucracy and backstage machinations of the Wikipedia. I even see a drop in the amount of article writing that I will do.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly amused by the "black eye" story. Just think of it: An autograph session gone bad, the worst tragedy in the entire 122 year history of the Phillies. Worse than the fatal bleacher collapse in 1903. Worse than the team collapse in 1964. Worse than being the worst team, year in and year out, in the history of major league baseball. Any bets on whether the writer was the recipient of those obscenities? Would that qualify as "original research"? &gt;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:41, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
