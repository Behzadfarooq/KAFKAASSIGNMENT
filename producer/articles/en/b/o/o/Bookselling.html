<p>In the book of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah.html" title="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> the prophet is represented as dictating to Baruch the scribe, who described the mode in which his book was written. These scribes were the earliest booksellers, and supplied copies as they were demanded. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, possessed a somewhat extensive library; and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> is recorded to have paid the large sum of one hundred <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minae.html" title="Minae">minae</a> for three small treatises of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philolaus.html" title="Philolaus">Philolaus</a> the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean.html" title="Pythagorean">Pythagorean</a>. When the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrian_library.html" title="Alexandrian library">Alexandrian library</a> was founded about <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_BC_9fcc.html" title="300 BC">300 B.C.</a>, various expedients were resorted to for the purpose of procuring books, and this appears to have stimulated the energies of the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athenian</a> booksellers. In <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, towards the end of the republic, it became the fashion to have a library as part of the household furniture; and the booksellers carried on a flourishing trade. Their shops (<i>taberna librarii</i>) were chiefly in the Argiletum, and in the Vicus Sandalarius. On the door, or on the side posts, was a list of the books on sale; and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial.html" title="Martial">Martial</a>, who mentions this also, says that a copy of his First Book of Epigrams might be purchased for five <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denar.html" title="Denar">denarii</a>. In the time of <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> the great booksellers were the Sosii. According to <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justinian.html" title="Justinian">Justinian</a>, a law was passed granting to the scribes the ownership of the material written; and in this may be traced as the beginnings of the modern law of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookselling.html" title="Edit section: Christianity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christianity</span></h3>
<p>The spread of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christianity</a> naturally created a great demand for copies of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospels</a> and other sacred books, and later on for missals and other devotional volumes for church and private use. Passing by the intermediate ages we find that previous to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, the text writers or stationers, who sold copies of the books then in use were formed into a gild (or <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">guild</a>). Some of these stationers had stations built against the very walls of the cathedral itself, in the same manner as they are still to be found in some of the older continental cities. Besides the sworn stationers there were many booksellers in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> who were not sworn; for one of the statutes, passed in <a href="../../../1/3/7/1373.html" title="1373">1373</a>, expressly states that, in consequence of their presence,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"books of great value are sold and carried away from Oxford, the owners of them are cheated, and the sworn stationers are deprived of their lawful business." It was, therefore, enacted that no bookseller except two sworn stationers or their deputies, should sell any book being either his own property or that of another, exceeding half a mark in value, under a pain of imprisonment, or, if the offence was repeated, of forfeiting his trade within the university.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookselling.html" title="Edit section: Modern bookselling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern bookselling</span></h2>
<p>The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing.html" title="Printing">printing</a>. The earliest printers were also <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editors.html" title="Editors">editors</a> and booksellers; but being unable to sell every copy of the works they printed, they had agents at most of the seats of learning. Antony Koburger, who introduced the art of printing into <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg.html" title="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> in <a href="../../../1/4/7/1470.html" title="1470">1470</a>.</p>
<p>The religious dissensions of the continent, and the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>, created a great demand for books; but in England neither <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_dynasty.html" title="Tudor dynasty">Tudor</a> nor <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Stuart_ff20.html" title="House of Stuart">Stuart</a> could tolerate a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_press.html" title="Free press">free press</a>, and various efforts were made to curb it. The first patent for the office of king's printer was granted to Thomas Berthelet by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1529.html" title="1529">1529</a>, but only such books as were first licensed were to be printed. At that time even the purchase or possession of an unlicensed book was a punishable offense. In <a href="../../../1/5/5/1556.html" title="1556">1556</a> the Company of Stationers was incorporated, and very extensive powers were granted in order that obnoxious books might be repressed. In the following reigns the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Chamber_beb6.html" title="Star Chamber">Star Chamber</a> exercised a pretty effectual censorship; but, in spite of all precaution, such was the demand for books of a polemical nature, that many were printed abroad and surreptitiously introduced into England. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a> interfered little with books except when they emanated from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholics_3f82.html" title="Roman Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, or touched upon her royal prerogatives; and towards the end of her reign, and during that of her successor, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James</a>, bookselling flourished. So much had bookselling increased during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protectorate_1120.html" title="The Protectorate">the Protectorate</a> that, in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1658.html" title="1658">1658</a>, was published <i>A Catalogue of the most Vendible Books in England</i> by W. London. A bad time immediately followed. Although there were provincial booksellers the centre of the trade was St. Paul's Churchyard. When the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a> began in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1666.html" title="1666">1666</a> the booksellers put their most of their stock in the vaults of the church, where it was destroyed. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> also restored the office of Licenser of the Press, which continued till <a href="../../../1/6/9/1694.html" title="1694">1694</a>.</p>
<p>In the first English Copyright Act (<a href="../../../1/7/0/1709.html" title="1709">1709</a>), which specially relates to booksellers, it is enacted that, if any person shall think the published price of a book unreasonably high, he may make a complaint to the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and to certain other persons named, who shall examine his complaint, and if well founded reduce the price; and any bookseller charging more than the price so fixed shall be fined <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_pound.html" title="English pound">£</a>5 for every copy sold. Apparently this enactment remained a dead letter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookselling.html" title="Edit section: Selling and publishing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Selling and publishing</span></h2>
<p>For later times it is necessary to make a gradual distinction between <i>booksellers</i>, whose trade consists in selling books, either by retail or wholesale, and <i><a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher.html" title="Publisher">publishers</a></i>, whose business involves the production of the books from the author's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuscript.html" title="Manuscript">manuscripts</a>, and who are the intermediaries between author and bookseller, just as the booksellers (in the restricted sense) are intermediaries between the author and publisher and the public. The convenience of this distinction is not impaired by the fact either that a publisher is also a wholesale bookseller, or that a still more recent development in publishing started a reaction to some extent in the way of amalgamating the two functions. The scheme of <i>The Times</i> Book Club (started in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>) was, again, a combination of a subscription library with the business of bookselling and it brought the organization of a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, with all its means of achieving publicity, into the work of pushing the sale of books, in a way which practically introduced a new factor into the bookselling business.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> it remains the fact that the distinction between publisher and bookseller--literary promoter and shopkeeper--became fundamental. The booksellers, as such, were engaged either in wholesale bookselling, or in the retail, the old or <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-hand.html" title="Second-hand">second-hand</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodical.html" title="Periodical">periodical</a> trades.</p>
<p>Coming between the publisher and the retail bookseller is the important distributing agency of the <i>wholesale bookseller</i>. It is to him that the retailer looks for his miscellaneous supplies, as it is simply impossible for him to stock one-half of the books published. In <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternoster_Row_cc39.html" title="Paternoster Row">Paternoster Row</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, which has for over a hundred years been the centre of this industry, may be seen the collectors from the shops of the retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books ordered by the book-buying public. It is also through these agencies that the country bookseller obtains his miscellaneous supplies. At the leading house in this department of bookselling almost any book can be found, or information obtained concerning it. At one of these establishments over 1,000,000 books are constantly kept in stock. It is here that the publisher calls first on showing or "subscribing" a new book, a critical process, for by the number thus subscribed the fate of a book is sometimes determined.</p>
<p>What may be termed the third partner in publishing and its ramification is the <i>retail bookseller</i>; and to protect his interests there was established in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> a London booksellers' society, which had for its object the restriction of discounts to 25%, and also to arrange prices generally and control all details connected with the trade. The society a few years afterwards widened its field of operations so as to include the whole of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and its designation then became "The Associated Booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland."</p>
<p>The trade in old or (as they are sometimes called) second-hand books is in a sense, no doubt, a higher class of business, requiring a knowledge of bibliography, while the transactions are with individual books rather than with numbers of copies. Occasionally dealers in this class of books replenish their stocks by purchasing remainders of books, which, having ceased from one cause or another to sell with the publisher, they offer to the public as bargains. The periodical trade grew up during the 19th century, and was in its infancy when the <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Magazine_3888.html" title="Penny Magazine">Penny Magazine</a></i>, <i>Chambers's Journal</i>, and similar publications first appeared. The growth of this important part of the business was greatly promoted by the abolition of the newspaper stamp and of the duty upon paper, the introduction of attractive illustrations, and the facilities offered for purchasing books by instalments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookselling.html" title="Edit section: Bookselling in America">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bookselling in America</span></h2>
<p>The history of bookselling in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a> has a special interest. The <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> settlements drew away from the old country much of its enterprise and best talent, and the presses of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and other cities teemed with publications mostly of a religious character, but many others, especially linguistic and historical, were also published. Bookselling in the United States was of a somewhat later growth, although printing was introduced into <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> as early as <a href="../../../1/6/7/1676.html" title="1676">1676</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1685.html" title="1685">1685</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1693.html" title="1693">1693</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Franklin_cc1b.html" title="Ben Franklin">Franklin</a> had served to make the trade illustrious, yet few persons were engaged in it at the commencement of the 19th century. Books chiefly for scholars and libraries were imported from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>; but after the second war printing-presses multiplied rapidly, and with the spread of newspapers and education there also arose a demand for books, and publishers set to work to secure the advantages offered by the wide field of English literature, the whole of which they had the liberty of reaping free of all cost beyond that of production. The works of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Scott_51ea.html" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Byron_c0e1.html" title="Lord Byron">Lord Byron</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Moore_2ea0.html" title="Thomas Moore">Thomas Moore</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Southey_1984.html" title="Robert Southey">Robert Southey</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wordsworth_6481.html" title="William Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, and indeed of every author of note, were reprinted without the smallest payment to author or proprietor. Half the names of the authors in the so-called "American" catalogue of books printed between <a href="../../../1/8/2/1820.html" title="1820">1820</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a> are British. By this means the works of the best authors were brought to the doors of all classes in the cheapest variety of forms. In consequence of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, the high price of labour, and the restrictive duties laid on in order to protect native industry, coupled with the frequent intercourse with England, a great change took place, and American publishers and booksellers, while there was still no international copyright, made liberal offers for early sheets of new publications. Boston, New York and Philadelphia still retained their old supremacy as bookselling centres. Meanwhile, the distinct publishing business also grew, till gradually the conditions of business became assimilated to those of Europe.</p>
<p>In the course of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th centuries</a> the Low Countries for a time became the chief centre of the bookselling world, and many of the finest folios and quartos in our libraries bear the names of Jansen, Blauw or Plantin, with the imprint of <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/r/Utrecht_%28city%29.html" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leiden.html" title="Leiden">Leiden</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, while the Elzevirs besides other works produced their charming little pocket classics. The southern towns of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douai.html" title="Douai">Douai</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Omer_b7ed.html" title="St Omer">St Omer</a> at the same time furnished polemical works in English.</p>
