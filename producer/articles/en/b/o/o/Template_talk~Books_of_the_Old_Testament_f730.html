	    <p>I added Ben Sira (this is how the article is titled, I've never seen it spelled anywhere else like this) and 2 Esdras under "Apocrypha".

At the moment you have a link to <a href="../../../1/_/e/1_Enoch_595d.html" title="1 Enoch">1 Enoch</a> at the bottom of the template? I'm trying to find out if it should link to the other two books as well. If this template should reference all three articles ill add links for them and add the template to those pages. Just looking for your advice and opinons, cheers.&#160;:) --Shimirel 02:16, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it shouldn't. 2 Enoch was only "discovered" in the 19th C. and exists only in Slavonic; I'm not aware of any Church that includes it in their canon (though I could always be wrong, you never know). 3 Enoch is known as Hebrew Enoch; it is also not in the canon of any Church that I am aware of. 1 Enoch is the only one of these that forms a part of any Church's canon at the moment, I'm pretty sure. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 02:21, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Psalms 151 through 155 are not part of the Oriental Orthodox canon.</li>
<li>The (Ethiopian) Oriental Orthodox canon does include books known as 1, 2, and 3 <i>Meqabyan</i> (= Maccabees), however, <b>these are not the same books</b> as the 1, 2, and 3 Maccabees used elsewhere, in fact, the 3 Ethiopian books have nothing whatsoever in common with any of the 4 books of Maccabees known outside of Ethiopia. You could say that in all this makes seven distinct books of Maccabees.</li>
<li>The Ethiopian <i>Dodesqalya</i> (Didascalia) according to my sources is NOT the same work as those known elsewhere as '<a href="../../../d/i/d/Didascalia.html" title="Didascalia">Didascalia</a>' nor '<a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html" title="Didache">Didache</a>'... (this is really hard to find as it has never been printed and exists only in manuscript)</li>
<li>2 Baruch is evidently included in the Syriac Peshitta, but that doesn't make it canonical in Oriental Orthodox Churches.</li>

<dd>Psalms 151-155 are part of the Syriac <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshitta.html" title="Peshitta">Peshitta</a>, which is "Oriental Orthodoxy". 1-4 Macc are part of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Orthodox_fe07.html" title="Greek Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a>, I agree they are not exactly identical with Ethiopian Macc, but not sure how to handle the issue with the currect structure. Ethiopian Didascalia is very similar to I-VII of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Constitutions_1845.html" title="Apostolic Constitutions">Apostolic Constitutions</a>, book VII is the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html" title="Didache">Didache</a>, perhaps a wikilink to there instead would be preferable.

<dd>If you want to make Peshitta a separate category, you could move the extra Psalms and 2 Baruch there since they are largely unknown in other Oriental Orthodox churches. May I ask what is your source for the contents of Dodesqalya? Like I said, it's practically impossible to find, never having been printed... Since The 4 Greek Macc's are not the same books at all as the 3 ones canonical in Ethiopia, they should not be represented as if they were. There are no articles yet for the Ethiopian books of Meqabyan, but I am familiar with their contents (they are in my Amharic Bible) and I could easily write such an article when I get enough spare time. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 03:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The idea that Russians have a book called 2 Esdras that is unique to them is silly, since they refer to is as 3 Esdras. While this name may be unique to them it is certainly not 2 Esdras according to 2000 years of naming tradition, since that is Ezra Nehemiah according to the LXX, or 4 Esdras according to the Vulgate.

<p>An anon. user has inserted text in several articles and this template that the <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms_of_Solomon_0cc7.html" title="Psalms of Solomon">Psalms of Solomon</a> is part of the Greek Orthodox canon. I think this is incorrect, based on the following: The Oxford Annotated <a href="../../../n/r/s/NRSV_0127.html" title="NRSV">NRSV</a> Bible states that the Greek Orthodox church uses the Catholic <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">deuterocanonical books</a> plus 1 Esdras, Psalm 151, the Prayer of Manasseh, and 3 Maccabees (4 Maccabees is in the appendix but not considered canonical).

203.32.87.174 23:45, 6 October 2006 (UTC) I don't think it's true either. There are quite a few references on the web making the claim, but they all give signs of having originated from the same spurious sources. I think is should be removed until better documentation is presented.</p>

<p>I am going to make a minor edit to this template that I believe is a matter of using more neutral language. However, since I feel that since this is a fairly widely-used template, I may be less than biased because I am a Protestant myself, and there may be a reason for the curent wording that I have missed, I don't want to do it without at least opening a discussion.</p>
<p>The template currently says that Protestants "removed" the apocryphal books, but most Protestants would say the opposite, that the apocryphal books <i>never were</i> part of the canon, and other divisions of Christianity "added" these books. With that in mind, I am going to change "removed" to "exclude", and likewise, a few lines down for the benefit of the Orthodox canon, I'm going to change "add" to "include". If there's a good technical reason why this is wrong, I'd be interested in hearing it. --<a href="../../../b/b/r/User%7EBBrucker2_a40a.html" title="User:BBrucker2">BBrucker2</a> 15:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The historical record shows that they were not only removed, but enables us to say when, where, and by whom. However, 'excluded' is just as good, and since some people were taught differently, is probably more neutral, so I won't quibble. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the books in question were removed from the Jewish canon around the year 90 by the Sanhedrin at the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jamnia_95b9.html" title="Council of Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a>. Most people think they decided to remove them because they have doctrines about the Messiah that were being used by Christians. However, the writings of the Early Church fathers clearly indicate that they continued to be used and revered as authoritative by the early Christian community, which itself was illegal in pagan Rome. Finally when Christianity was legalized in the 300s, the Roman Emperors decided to reorganize the Church, and decided to suppress the very same books that the Sanhedrin had suppressed, again rejecting the books in question. However, this had no effect on Christians living outside the Roman Empire which is why they still have these books in their Bible. So the Bible that is missing these books, is in effect, a Judaeo-Romanized version. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, congratulations a truly useful template. This template takes a topic with many complicated technical details and sets it out very clearly. Good job.</p>
<p>A couple of small suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Width:</i> There is a lot of information here in small print, which sometimes doesn't format very well on the short lines allowed in the template. Perhaps the template could be slightly widened in order to accomodate the text better (which would also result in it being shorter from top to bottom)?</li>
<li><i>Septuagint:</i> Some brief mention should make about the order of the books in all Christian denominations deriving from the order of books as found in the Septuagint, with variations (as the template clearly shows but doesn't explain).</li>
<li><i>Torah:</i> Is there a reason why the 5 books of the Torah/Pentateuch aren't listed?</li>

<dd>The width seems fine to me? Though... as to why not listing the 5 books of the Torah, perhaps to save space? There is a link there, easy to follow it and see more details. Finally, I'll just mention I think it is a great template too! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup></dd>

<p>The template should probably be updated to include a section on the Samaritans. Aherents of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritanism.html" title="Samaritanism">Samaritanism</a> have a different view of the canon than mainstream <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Samaritans, according to the Wikipedia <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritan.html" title="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> article, they only hold the Samaritan version of the Torah as inspired (though they have other texts of lesser standing). It should be noted that this version of the Torah differs from the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic_Text_3b56.html" title="Masoretic Text">Massoratic Text</a>, and is writen in an older (pre-Babylonian Exile) script of Hebrew. —<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikijeff_9a04.html" title="User:Wikijeff">Wikijeff</a> 03:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On another note, I think the template should be widened some as well. —<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikijeff_9a04.html" title="User:Wikijeff">Wikijeff</a> 03:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
