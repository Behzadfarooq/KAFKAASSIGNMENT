<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:100map.gif</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

<p>On the <a href="../../../w/j/z/WJZ-TV_52a2.html" title="WJZ-TV">WJZ-TV</a> and <a href="../../../w/m/a/WMAR-TV_4b7f.html" title="WMAR-TV">WMAR-TV</a> pages you re-added wikilinks around people's names. On all the ones you added, it comes up with a red link, which is of course for a page that doesn't exist (ie: John Buren). Most editors hate red links and do away with them until the page is made by another editor. Please check to see if the wikilinks you are adding are creating a red link, if so, please remove the wikilink. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Toil</a>)</sup> 09:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
