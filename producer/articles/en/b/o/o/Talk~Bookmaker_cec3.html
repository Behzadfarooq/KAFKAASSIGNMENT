<p>The bookmaker does not generally attempt to make money from the bets themselves, but rather profiting from the event regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>This phrase implies the presences of a betting fee, similar to stock trading fees payed to stock brokers, but does not explicitly mention such a fee.</p>
<p>Being ignorant of gambling myself I am loath to touch the actual article text. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyj_462c.html" title="User:Funkyj">Funkyj</a> 17:57, 2005 May 31 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>With a traditional bookmakers, there is no betting fee - by 'profiting from the event', what is meant is the profit arising from surplus remaining to the bookie from all the non-returned stakes on the losing horse/team/outcome, once all the winners have been paid their winnings and had their stakes returned.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, the bookies are gambling against the punters, not on the event itself. The punter is betting on <i>x</i> to occur. The bookie is betting the punter is wrong - they're not betting on <i>x</i> itself, as such.<br />
<br />
<i>However</i>, the online betting exchanges <i>do</i> take a commission. This is because of the 'service' they provide, in which they cut out the middleman, the bookie, by putting 'Backers' directly in touch with 'Layers' (q.v.). Consequently, they make no money from the event, but nor are they betting against the punter. Online, punters are betting directly against other punters. Online betting exchanges therefore make their money from the activity surrounding the event, rather than the event itself.<br />

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Talk%7EBookmaker_cec3.html" title="Edit section: Back and Lay?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Back and Lay?</span></h2>
<p>The article mentions "Back and Lay bets". Since this is not explained anywhere, could this be expanded (or wikified, if I've missed the article)? 81.134.176.76 23:02, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>A 'Back' bet is what you, the punter, traditionally make. You back a horse to come in at 10/1. In UK or Ireland, what happens next is you hand your stake, say £1, over to your bookie for 'safekeeping' (because, as the article says, historically gambling debts were unenforceable). He records the event in his book and gives you a receipt (betting stub). If your horse does come in first, you present your stub to your bookie, who returns you your £1 stake, plus £10 of his 'own' money (in reality, £10 taken from the money staked by those who backed the losing horses). If the horse loses - and most do - the bookie adds your stake to the pile of all the other losers' stakes, and looks forward to a fat cigar at the end of the day's racing (we're ignoring each-way - place - betting here for ease of exposition).<br />
<br />
What the bookie is doing is 'Laying', i.e., he is laying odds of 10/1 against the horse winning. In the traditional scenario, only the bookie 'lays'.<br />
<br />
Now, however, many of the online betting exchanges mentioned in this fine article, offer the punter the opportunity effectively to act as bookies. In other words, when you 'Lay' bet, you put up your £1 stake against the horse winning, plus your odds (though of course your own odds will be governed by what all the other 'Layers' are offering - it is a market after all), and hope that someone will find your odds attractive enough to tempt them to match your stake, by putting up a £1 of their own. If the horse doesn't win, you keep their stake. If it does win at, again, say, 10/1, you owe your opponent in the betting ring their £1 plus £10 of your own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If I wanted to back a horse at odds of 4/1 and I wanted to put €43 on it, then I am risking losing my €43 for a potential gain of €172.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Now, for laying, think of being on the other side of the above transaction. Someone else is going to risk their €43 for a potential gain of €172 and we are going to accommodate them. That's what laying is. So I lay the horse at odds of 4/1 for a stake of €43, which means I have a potential gain of €43 but a risk of losing €172. The odds don't affect what I might gain by laying, only what I might lose.</i><a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2054910815&amp;page=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2054910815&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now why would you want to enter into a bet where your potential gain is much less than your potential loss? Well, in placing a 'Lay' bet, essentially you've become a bookie, and there aren't many poor bookies in my experience! In a 10 horse race, only one is going to win. You just have to hope it's not the one you've laid against.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Is it worth it? Depends on the odds and the situation.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>If you're dead certain Red Paul's Hope is going to thrash the field of 10, despite its odds of 10/1, you'd be better off putting £1 on Red Paul's Hope to win, rather than laying £1 against every other horse in the field. On the other hand, if everyone else is equally dead certain that Red Paul's Hope is the one that will win, then the odds against its winning are going to tumble. If Red Paul's Hope ended up 1/10 on (so that you'd have to put up £10 to get £1 back), laying against the other horses may make more sense - if you can find anyone to willing, as they say in the British Isles, to 'oppose' Red Paul's Hope, by betting on some other horse to win the race.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>So that's the principle. Now I should say that extending to the punter the ability to bet on a horse - or on any other event - to lose, rather than to win, has provoked a lot of disquiet; as the Kieron Fallon case demonstrates (the then UK Champion jockey Kieron Fallon, along with jockeys Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams, was arrested and charged in September 2004, over allegations of race-fixing and plotting to defraud Betfair customers by ensuring that horses lost races between December 2002 and September 2004. <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kieren_Fallon_8366.html#Allegations_of_Race_Fixing" title="Kieren Fallon">Kieren_Fallon#Allegations_of_Race_Fixing</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1164355,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1164355,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Even in one-on-one contests such as a football or a boxing match, betting on <i>x</i> to win is not the same as betting on <i>y</i> to lose: even if the inevitable result of <i>x</i> winning is that <i>y</i> loses, the odds that <i>y</i> wins are generally not the inverse of <i>x</i> losing. Odds of 6/4 <i>x</i> to win vs 9/5 <i>y</i> to win are fairly typical in football betting <a href="http://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/coca-cola-championship" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/coca-cola-championship" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. So, in outlining the bases for this disquiet, I do not think that it is an unacceptable POV to state that it is a widely held belief that to enter into a bet that <i>x</i> loses is inevitably to introduce a greater temptation to dishonesty than it is to bet on on <i>y</i> to win. It is a widely held opinion with the racing world that punters', stables', in particular, ability to make 'lay bets' is responsible for the scandal surrounding Mr Fallon <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/comment/0,,1162366,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/comment/0,,1162366,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Bookies, who <i>are</i> betting on horses/teams/athletes to lose, generally are honest: as the article says, they are essentially actuaries (if with more exciting lives), which means that they know that the odds are with them so that they're going to make (a lot) more money than they lose over the course of a race meeting or season. But they are also kept honest by stringent regulations and the sanction of losing their licences (which means their livelihoods) if they are associated with anything less than honesty.<br />
<br />
Punters on the betting exchanges are subject to no comparable degree of scrutiny and sanction and may only ever be seeking to land a one-off 'coup'. Horses, in particular, are inherently unpredictable creatures, do lose for all sorts of inexplicable reasons and sins of omission (such as not trying <i>quite</i> hard enough to win) are a lot easier to disguise than sins of commission. The exchanges do monitor 'unusual' activity and can notify the relevant authorities of this, withdraw betting privileges etc, but clearly they cannot exercise anything like the scrutiny and sanction that the Horserace Betting Levy Board (or its Irish equivalent, the Irish Horseracing Authority) can exercise over UK or Irish bookmakers, and an illegal 'coup' may only be discovered long after the miscreants have made off with their ill-gotten gains<a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/story/0,,2015294,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/story/0,,2015294,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Even then, as the Kieron Fallon case, which is dragging on into its 3rd year, confirms, it is very hard to prove wrongdoing <a href="http://www.ateonline.co.uk/60/58/62/articles/9977.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ateonline.co.uk/60/58/62/articles/9977.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. It should go without saying that Mr Fallon remains innocent until he should ever be proven guilty. Nonetheless, it is the Fallon case in particular which is immediate source of the disquiet surrounding the availability of 'Lay' bets to the punter via the betting exchanges.<br />

<p>I remember watching a BBC documentary on the history of uk gambling law and it stated that when bookmakers were first allowed they were regulated with some unusual requirements: They were not allowed to provide padded seats, could not make the place 'welcoming' and I think they were not allowed customer toilets. This was, according to the documentary, all part of regulation's plan to make bookmakers a place that someone would go to make a bet, but not stay for the afternoon. Obviously these laws have since been relaxed. If people think this is worthy of addition I may try and track down a source to back up my memory. <a href="../../../n/y/1/User%7ENy156uk_f375.html" title="User:Ny156uk">ny156uk</a> 09:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
