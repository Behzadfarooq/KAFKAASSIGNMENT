	    <p>This page is missing one use of "bootstrapping" from Philosophy. Philosophers accuse others of bootstrapping, when, for example, one believes he has reason to believe a proposition p just because he does believe the proposition p. I don't know offhand a precise definition of philosophical bootstrapping (I came to this page looking for one), but it's something that ought to be added. Npdoty 23:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Bootstrapping is commonly used to describe a programming language compiler which is "written in itself". For example, writing a C++ compiler in C++. This can be done in several ways:</p>
<p>1) Initially using an existing compiler for that language possibly from a 3rd party vendor. 2) Initially coding the new compiler in a different language altogether to get a working compiler then rewrite the compiler in the new language. 3) Write the compiler in the target language and "hand-compile" the code using a hexadecimal or octal editor.</p>
<p>I've heard this term used to describe the PC boot process quite often and wonder if this is in error. I'm really not sure. Possibly two definitions? -Robert Lee</p>

<dd>Bootstrapping a compiler and bootstrapping a PC are two different things. By the way, can anyone remember the PDP-8 paper tape bootstrap sequence? I used to know it off by heart, and toggle it in twice daily... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a></dd>

<p>I moved "Bootstrap" to "Bootstrapping". "To bootstrap" is a verb, whereas articles should be titled according to nouns (here, "bootstrapping".) Aside from that principled reason, "bootstrap" also "just sounded weird" as a title. --<a href="../../../r/y/g/User%7ERyguasu_fbf3.html" title="User:Ryguasu">Ryguasu</a> 21:33 Apr 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good move, Ryguasu. It's always called "bootstrapping", and the "most common form" rule applies. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<dd><i>Bootstrap</i> is a <i>verb</i>??? Weird! No, it's not always called "bootstrapping"; the word "bootstrap" is used as a noun, and <i>obviously</i> was originally a noun. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:24 Apr 28, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Little problem with the redirect of 'bootstrap' to 'bootstrapping': there's a theory in physics by Geoffrey Chew called "Bootstrap (Theory, Approach, Philosophy, etc)".

<dd>Baron Münchhausen did, according to stories, pull himself out of a swamp, but by his own hairs, not by his bootstraps. There's even a German saying that goes "to pull oneself out by one's own hairs" when somebody somehow manages to get out of an apparently hopeless situaton. So, it should be "hairpulling" if the etymology is correct.--84.135.220.161 10:58, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC) (Anno)</dd>

<p>Is the section on statistical bootstrapping big enough for its own article? (Currently, all the external links in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping.html" title="Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a> seem to deal with statistical bootstrapping). What do statisticians call it? Should the article be named statistical bootstrapping or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29.html" title="Bootstrapping (statistics)">bootstrapping (statistics)</a> or bootstrapping (math) or something else entirely? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCary_1a42.html" title="User:DavidCary">DavidCary</a> 05:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I think a separate article on bootstrapping (and other resampling methods) would be a good idea. It is, in effect, an alternative approach to the conventional approach to statistics based on probability theory.</p>

<p>Not wishing to complicate matters too much here, but in my early computing days there were such things as bootstrap code and bootstrap loaders. A machine such as a Digico M16E would employ a multibootstrap process in order to load complex software (such as an amino acid sequence analyser). Inbuilt into the firmware was a short byte sequence that could be triggered by an interrupt. It would be loaded into an area of RAM and begin running in a simple loop.</p>
<p>This was the core bootstrap code, and it would cycle around, waiting for and loading byte or word values provided by a punched paper tape reader (placing the values into sequential memory addresses) until the last instruction over-wrote part of the core bootstrap and caused a jump into the code that had just been loaded, which was a more complex bootstrap loader, capable of handling relative rather than absolute address references. This bootstrap would then load the main program into areas of memory and then it too would be overwritten at a key point in order to jump into the "real" program just loaded.</p>
<p>A complicated process, and done without the benefit of tape or disk drives of any sort (or monitor, come to that - the sole display was a small LED panel that showed values in octal). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterBrooks_2119.html" title="User:PeterBrooks">PeterBrooks</a> 00:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>is right: my contributions really do hurt <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a> guideline seriously: I have not found yet any source which would use exactly term “bootstrapping” for knocking alphabet or for SETI programs.</p>
<p>After I have reread again the Guideline more carefully, it seems also for me that it prohibits such amount of synthesis explicitly.</p>
<p>I found some materials on linguistics, which use term “bootstrapping” for some related topics. So I replace my contributions with linking these sources on the Article page; and I move my unencyclopedic contributions to <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysis_ac9e.html" title="User:Physis">my Wikipedia profile</a>.</p>

<p>The article needed to distinguish, early on, between (1) merely using the bootstraps for putting on boots and (2) lifting oneself into the air by pulling up on the straps of the boots one is wearing. The first is a comparatively easy task--I've done it, using boot-hooks that grab the bootstraps. The second is impossible except by magic.</p>
<p>The allusion, for nearly all the cases of this term, is to the second use of bootstraps, where magic is obviously being invoked.</p>
<p>For a true feat of bootstrapping magic, consider the Burroughs <a href="../../../b/5/0/B5000.html" title="B5000">B5000</a> Algol compiler, which was written in Algol. There was no assembler. A tiny proto-compiler was constructed, by hand, in B5000 machine language. The code resulting from the initial compilation of the (Algol-source) compiler was used to compile itself. All remaining software (such as the OS and the Fortran compiler, as well as improved Algol compilers) was written in Algol.</p>
<p>If I had the gumption, I would make this page into a proper disambiguation. Would someone take it on? Amazing how much work gets done in spite of all us lazy contributors!</p>

<dl>
<dd>I actually don't think it's referring to the second idea at all. It's an allusion to the fact that putting on large boots without using bootstraps is very difficult, but once bootstraps are added to the boots, the process becomes quite doable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, compiling the Algol compiler without an existing Algol compiler is very difficult (read: impossible). By adding a bare bones compiler to the mix, though, the process becomes doable. - <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooey_27ae.html" title="User:Flooey">Flooey</a> 08:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
