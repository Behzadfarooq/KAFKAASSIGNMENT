<p><i><b>Books of Blood</b></i> are a series of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_fiction.html" title="Horror fiction">horror fiction</a> collections written by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> author <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Barker_c378.html" title="Clive Barker">Clive Barker</a>.</p>
<p>There are six books in total, each simply subtitled <i>Volume 1</i> through to <i>Volume 6</i>, and were subsequently re-published in two omnibus editions containing three volumes each. Each volume contains four or five stories.</p>
<p>They were published between <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. With the publication of the first volume, Barker became an overnight sensation and was hailed by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> as "the future of horror". The book won both the British and World Fantasy Awards.</p>
<p>Although undoubtedly horror stories, like most of Barker's work they mix <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> themes in as well. The tales invariably take place in a contemporary setting, usually featuring <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everyman.html" title="Everyman">everyday people</a> who become embroiled in a terrifying or mysterious events. Barker has stated in <a href="../../../f/a/c/Faces_of_Fear_%28interview_book%29_af88.html" title="Faces of Fear (interview book)">Faces of Fear (interview book)</a> that an inspiration for The Books of Blood was when he read <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Forces_%28book%29_6d2c.html" title="Dark Forces (book)">Dark Forces (book)</a> in the early 1980's and realized that a horror story collection must not have any narrow themes, consistent tone or restrictions. The stories could range from the humorous to the truly horrific.</p>
<p>One of the stories, "The Forbidden," was adapted into the movie, <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Candyman_%28film%29.html" title="Candyman (film)">Candyman</a></i>, although the film was set in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> whilst the story was set in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>For some editions, each book's cover was illustrated by Clive Barker himself.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the stories in the Books of Blood were adapted by Eclipse Books in the comic series <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tapping_the_Vein_%28comic%29_602b.html" title="Tapping the Vein (comic)">Tapping the Vein</a> as well as other titled adaptions.</p>

<p>This is the frame story for the entire <i>Books of Blood</i> series. A <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> researcher, Mary Florescu, has employed a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quack</a> <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_%28spirituality%29.html" title="Medium (spirituality)">medium</a> named Simon McNeal to investigate a <a href="../../../h/a/u/Haunted_house.html" title="Haunted house">haunted house</a>. Alone in an upstairs room, McNeal at first fakes visions, but then the ghosts really do come for him. They attack him and carve words in his flesh, and these words, claims the narrator, form the rest of the stories, stories written on a literal, living Book of Blood.</p>

<p>A down-and-out man, Leon Kaufman, falls asleep on a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_subway_8e05.html" title="New York subway">New York subway</a> train, only to wake up at a secret station beyond the end of the line. Kaufman encounters a man named Mahogany, who has killed and butchered several people and hung their bodies up on the train. Mahogany remarks that he will be forced to kill Kaufman to guard his secrets. Kaufman fights Mahogany and kills him in self-defense, but then the train doors open and strange malformed creatures board the train. The creatures eat the dead passengers, then force Kaufman to serve them as their new butcher, cutting out his tongue to ensure his silence. They tell Kaufman that Mahogany was getting old and could not do the job any longer, and that Kaufman now has a new career. It is also revealed that the creatures have also been the secret rulers of New York City for centuries. The police have always covered up for the creatures. Kaufman finds he now has lifetime employment.</p>

<p>Jack Polo is a gherkin importer who's haunted by a minor <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> called the Yattering. Despite its determined efforts to drive Jack mad, the Yattering is frustrated by his good cheer and apparent obliviousness. Bound by the powers of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> to stay in Jack's house until it succeeds, the Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, killing his cats and terrorizing his family, but all fail. Eventually Jack tricks it into leaving the house, and by violating the orders of its demonic masters, the Yattering becomes Jack's servant. Unusual for Barker's early work, this story is unabashedly comic.</p>

The producer, Terry, is informed that Mr. Lichfield disapproves of the production's Viola, Diane Duvall, in comparison to his dead wife Constantia. Incidentally, Terry is having an affair with Diane.

<p>Two gay men, Mick and Judd, go on a romantic but strained vacation in <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. In an isolated rural area, there happens an astounding event: two entire cities, Popolac and Podujevo, create massive communal creatures by binding together the bodies of their citizens, many thousands of people walking as the body of a single giant, as tall as a <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a>. It's a ritual that occurs every ten years, but this time, things go wrong, and the Podujevo giant collapses, killing tens of thousands horribly. Mick and Judd come upon the smashed bodies of Podujevo and a ravine awash with blood, but at first do not see the City of Popolac walking behind nearby hills. Meanwhile, in shock, the entire population of Popolac goes mad, and in losing their individual minds actually become the giant they are strapped into. Popolac wanders the hills aimlessly. By nightfall many of the people who made up the giant die from exhaustion, but still it walks. Mick and Judd are told the truth about the giants by a local man who tried to steal their car, catch up with Popolac and reason with it before it collapses and destroys the people who compose it. But Mick and Judd at first do not believe his story. They seek shelter at a remote farm, but Popolac blunders right into the farmhouse that night. Its giant foot kills Judd by accident. The elderly farm couple who see Popolac go crazy with fear. Mick, seeing Popolac, goes insane too, but wants to join Popolac. He climbs up the tower of ropes and bodies, and is carried away as it walks into the hills to its fate. The story was written just a few years before Yugoslavia tore itself apart in civil war.</p>
<p>This story is often cited by critics as the best story in <i>The Books of Blood</i>.</p>

Quaid's experiments, all along, were to try to help him understand his own fear of being axed to death by a deadly stalker, but ironically his experiments in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobias.html" title="Phobias">phobias</a> made his own come to life.</p>

If Satan's minion wins, then he, Satan, gets to rule the Earth. An athlete taking part in the event, Joel, begins to realise the true meaning of things and what is at stake when his fellow human competitors begin to fall, savaged by some unseen beast. We also learn of the deal a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanist.html" title="Satanist">satanist</a>, Gregory, makes with Hell. He has staked his life and soul on this race. Meanwhile, Joel does not win the race due to a struggle with Hell's shape-shifting runner, who bites off Joel's face. However, the last surviving runner jogs past them to the finishing line. Hell loses out once again. Gregory is hardly surprised when he is punished for his overconfidence by being gruesomely slain.</p>

<p>Jacqueline Ess is a housewife who attempts <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> after becoming bored with her life. She recovers only to find that she has an ability to change people's body shapes simply with her mind. She accidentally kills her therapist and then - somewhat less accidentally - kills her husband, simply by willing their bodies into tearing apart or folding in on themselves. One man becomes obsessed with her and tracks her down. Jacqueline eventually becomes a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a>, her abilities giving her the power to give men the ultimate sexual experience, albeit one that always proves fatal. She has by now lost control of herself and has to be watched whilst sleeping in case she unconsiously mutilates her own body. The man obsessed with her eventually makes love to Jacqueline and they willingly die together by Jacqueline's powers.</p>
