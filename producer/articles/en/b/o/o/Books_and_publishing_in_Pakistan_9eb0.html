With the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official.html" title="Official">official</a> literacy rates at 46 percent, it is no surprise then when one finds out that the book <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> here is almost non-existent.

<p>In a country like <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> which shared a literary and cultural <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage.html" title="Heritage">heritage</a> with <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> for hundreds of years, it’s hard to point out the exact point of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin.html" title="Origin">origin</a> of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">book</a> industry. Nonetheless, it can be said that the first book in <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> was published in the early <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventeenth_century.html" title="Seventeenth century">seventeenth century</a> in this region.</p>
<p>In the early eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, poetry was the most popular form of all books in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-continent.html" title="Sub-continent">sub-continent</a>. <b><a href="../../../m/i/r/Mir_Anis_b774.html" title="Mir Anis">Mir Anis</a>, Muhammad Hussein Azad, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altaf_Hussain_Hali_c37e.html" title="Altaf Hussain Hali">Altaf Hussain Hali</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibli_Nomani_6600.html" title="Shibli Nomani">Shibli Nomani</a>, Abdul Haleem Sharar and Akbar Allah Abadi</b> were the names associated with the genre. These were the great names in early Urdu <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> who voiced the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> culture in the diverse climate of the sub-continent.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose.html" title="Prose">Prose</a> writers of the time too, namely Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Shibli Nomani, Abdul Haleem Sharar and Molvi Nazir Ahmed, took upon the task of educating and imparting values among the Muslims. It was feared that the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> majority will eventually overshadow the Muslim <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">thought</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a>. It were these literary pioneers who took upon the task to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educate.html" title="Educate">educate</a> the millions of Muslims of the sub-continent who were already very rigid to study or go beyond their set religious <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books.html" title="Books">books</a>.</p>

<p>It can be said that the efforts of the early poetry and prose writers bore fruit and the Muslims rose in their own defense against <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny.html" title="Tyranny">tyranny</a>. Eventually Pakistan came into being in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riots.html" title="Riots">riots</a> and the communal tension at the time of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> of Pakistan gave birth to a new genre of <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a> in the region. A large number of prose writers and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a> writers took upon the task of writing about the horror of riots and the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> of religion. This genre of fiction became to be generally known as <b>Tales of the Riots</b> and the writings represented the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misery.html" title="Misery">misery</a> of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> suffering at the time. A rich culture of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_stories.html" title="Short stories">short stories</a> was born after <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> and Pakistan saw some of the best prose writers in the era. Out of the many writers, <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saadat_Hasan_Manto_164b.html" title="Saadat Hasan Manto">Saadat Hasan Manto</a> is one name which merits undisputed acclaims for his unbiased writings. His writings like <i>Thanda Gosht, Khol Do, Toba Tek Singh, Iss Manjdhar Mein, Mozalle, Babu Gopi Nath</i> etc became legendary.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_realism.html" title="Literary realism">Realism</a> became the key word in the decade after independence. Writers explored the realms of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_change.html" title="Social change">social change</a> and adjustment, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a>, class stratification etc. <b>Qurat ul Ain Haider, Ibraheem Jalees, <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Nadeem_Qasmi_666d.html" title="Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi">Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi</a>, Intizar Hussain</b> etc all wrote classic pieces of literature based on these issues.</p>

<p><a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_literature.html" title="Urdu literature">Urdu literature</a> has a long and colorful history that is inextricably tied to the development of that very language, Urdu, in which it is written. While it tends to be heavily dominated by poetry, the range of expression achieved in the voluminous library of a few major verse forms, especially the ghazal and nazm, has led to its continued development and expansion into other styles of writing, including that of the short story, or afsana. It is today most popular in the countries of India and Pakistan and is finding interest in foreign countries primarily through South Asians.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_and_publishing_in_Pakistan_9eb0.html" title="Edit section: Fiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fiction</span></h3>
<p>We can trace back <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> fiction from the pre-partition times when pioneers like Mirza Haadi Ruswa wrote classics like Umrao Jan Ada. These writers wrote not only to entertain but to educate the masses and to revive the culture in the Indo-Pak at a time when the society was greatly over shadowed by British values. Coming to the present age, although the number of prose writers is increasing the quality of fiction being churned out is very low. The writers mainly focus on profit and thus give less preference to the quality. Trashy romance novels, low cost thrillers, formula books, television soaps turned into novels etc are abundant in the market. That is not to say that we don’t have good quality writers. One recent name is that of Saadat Nasreen who published her first collection of short stories last year.</p>
<p>Humour too is a very popular form of <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a>. Shafiq Ur Rehman is one of the names among loads of others who have contributed generously to this colorful genre of literature.</p>
<p>Apart from this, several successful attempts have been made at translating major works of English and other languages into Urdu, these range from popular titles like <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> to present age fiction like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Non-fiction" id="Non-fiction"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_and_publishing_in_Pakistan_9eb0.html" title="Edit section: Non-fiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Non-fiction</span></h3>
<p>A huge diverse collection of non-fiction literature is also something we can boast of. From travelogues to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographies.html" title="Biographies">biographies</a> to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_affairs_%28news_format%29.html" title="Current affairs (news format)">current affairs</a> and religious books, Urdu caters to all. Religious books perhaps are the oldest form of non-fiction literature and they are popular not only at home but also abroad, especially the Quranic scriptures and works of great scholars. At present we have an impressive number of publishers specializing in religious books. Mustansar Hussain Tarar is a name almost synonymous to travelogues and his works are appreciated widely. Current affairs, scientific journals and political analyses books are also catching up. Another emerging trend is that of book adaptations of popular TV shows like that of Dr. Shahid Masood. His books, apart from his television programs are in huge demand in the market.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_and_publishing_in_Pakistan_9eb0.html" title="Edit section: Poetry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Poetry</span></h3>
<p>Poetry is one of the richest and oldest forms of Urdu literature and famous names like <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghalib.html" title="Ghalib">Ghalib</a>, Mir <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allama_Iqbal_5801.html" title="Allama Iqbal">Allama Iqbal</a>, Altaf Hussain Hali, Molalana Abul Kalam Azada, and etc had already created a name for themselves before partition. More recently there have been notable poets like <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faiz_Ahmed_Faiz_62af.html" title="Faiz Ahmed Faiz">Faiz Ahmed Faiz</a> whom one can fondly remember as being the maestros of their time. Even at present there are a number of poetry collections being taken out every year. One cannot forget the names of Juan Elia and Perveen Shakir when talking about poetry.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/e/Poets.html" title="Poets">Poets</a> in the sub-continent and in Pakistan too, have focused on a wide range of topics from social awareness, to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>, to religion and even <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_love.html" title="Romantic love">romance</a>.</p>

<p>A colorful <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookshelf.html" title="Bookshelf">bookshelf</a> full of books is an ideal part of any child’s library. Urdu offers a beautiful range of books for children from <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_tales.html" title="Folk tales">folk tales</a> to poetry to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novels.html" title="Novels">novels</a> and short stories. Even religious books have been written keeping in mind the tender age of children. The low cost books like the popular thriller series also contributed a lot in developing the reading culture in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children.html" title="Children">children</a>. Recently there has been a trend of writing awareness books of children on issues like health, <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">environment</a> and even <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">child abuse</a>. These have received wide appreciation due to their content and good quality printing with illustrations. One popular series is the <b>Mina</b> series initiated by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/UNICEF_d137.html" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>. Other NGOs are also working on such books for children.</p>

<p>From non-existent to rapidly growing, the readership of Urdu books is now stagnant. The decline can be attributed to a number of factors. Television is one of the oft quoted culprits of declining reading habits but that is not the only one. The fact is that now people don’t give much importance to quality literature maybe because a dearth of writers.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhi.html" title="Sindhi">Sindhi</a> is one of the most ancient languages among the regional languages of Pakistan. Translations of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Quran_b79e.html" title="Holy Quran">Holy Quran</a>, Life of Hole <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">Prophet</a>, history, religion, politics, culture and literature are the diverse range of Sindhi books. <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Abdul_Latif_Bhittai_017b.html" title="Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai">Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai</a> is one of the most renowned names in the Sindhi poetry and he is widely read and understood by people all over the world Another name is that of <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sachal_Sarmast_bb60.html" title="Sachal Sarmast">Sachal Sarmast</a> whose poetry is also very popular.</p>

<p>Among Pakistan’s several regional languages, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi.html" title="Punjabi">Punjabi</a> is the closest to Urdu and the most colorful one too. And because of that, many singers have adopted Punjabi to add ‘spice’ to their songs. And this tradition is not new, poets like <a href="../../../w/a/r/Waris_Shah_a07f.html" title="Waris Shah">Waris Shah</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulleh_Shah_903b.html" title="Bulleh Shah">Bulleh Shah</a> etc contributed tremendously to the genre of Punjabi poetry and their poetry has been adopted by singers since very long. Punjabi literature however, was not as developed as the Sindhi literature. The roots of Punhabi prose can safely be traced back to Baba Nanak’s Janam Sakhis, but the lack of attention paid to the medium hampered its growth.</p>
<p>The literary scene was dominated by Urdu even until the 50s and no one paid a second thought to a group of people publishing Punjabi books and taking out a magazine.</p>
<p>But it was these people who took the initiative and can be termed as building the Punjabi literary scene from the scratch. And now, it’s obvious that their efforts did not go in vain. Last year the Lehran Adabi Board published a book Lehran Behran, which is a collection of critical articles on Punjabi language and literature.</p>
<p>Also an autobiography, Sahwan Da Visa, by Sharif Kureishi, a biography, Ahmad Rahi: Batan Mulaqatan by Ahmad Salim and a travelogue by Prof Asjiq Raheel were among the important books of prose published last year. Several notable poetry collections were also published along with two translated works.</p>

<p>Early <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushto.html" title="Pushto">pushto</a> writers, after independence were ‘passive nationalists, progressive nationalists, radical nationalists and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxists.html" title="Marxists">Marxists</a>. Except the passive nationalists, almost all of them were politically motivated.’ (ref; Pashto Literature - A Quest for Identity Fazlur Rahim Marwat)</p>
<p>Pushto literature developed within the Pushto struggle for freedom from what they saw as oppression of the ruling class, and this was clearly reflected in their writings. Taking a look at last years Pushto literary pieces we can say that Pushto writing has moved towards objectivism to subjectivism. The quality of books has also improved considerably.</p>

<p>Poetry is the only form of literature in the language which has seen some activity lately. Poetry was and still is a considerably major part of Balochi literature, with a rich history of 600 years. Last year too was an important year for Balochi poetry and a number of noteworthy collections were published. Darya Chankey Housham Ent by Munir Momin is the most significant of them all.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to categorize writers in this genre. There are a few very good <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> and short story writers who have won accolades not only nationally but also internationally, but it seems hard to draw the line between Pakistani and non-Pakistani writers here. The main problem being the fact that most of these writers are although born in Pakistan but they never really lived here and hence have no contact with their origins. <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulfikar_Ghose_9360.html" title="Zulfikar Ghose">Zulfikar Ghose</a>’s <i>Murder of Aziz Khan</i> was the first cohesive modern English language novel published in 1967. The plot no doubt was purely a Pakistani theme but the fact remains that Ghose never really did live here and the rest of his novels were set in South America. In 1980, renowned novelist, <a href="../../../b/a/p/Bapsi_Sidhwa_bbd7.html" title="Bapsi Sidhwa">Bapsi Sidhwa</a> published her first novel, <i>the crow eaters</i>, from England. Ms. Sidhwa is thus far considered to be amongst the best known authors of Pakistani origin. But then again, she does not live in Pakistan any more. Some of the best English literature came from expatriate Pakistanis in the West. One such author, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanif_Kureishi_7f44.html" title="Hanif Kureishi">Hanif Kureishi</a>, wrote a haunting memoir, <i>The Rainbow Sign</i> (1986), trying to bring together the two worlds he lived in. Another, <a href="../../../a/a/m/Aamer_Hussein_e2c8.html" title="Aamer Hussein">Aamer Hussein</a>, wrote a series of acclaimed short story collections. English literature grew rapidly over the next few years and several writers came on the scene and won international awards. Adam ZameenZad, Hanif Kureishi, Nadeem Aslam and Bapsi Sidhwa all received several awards for their writings. Then there was the younger generation of Pakistani writers, again mostly expatriates. <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bina_Shah_c9d4.html" title="Bina Shah">Bina Shah</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamila_Shamsie_f765.html" title="Kamila Shamsie">Kamila Shamsie</a>, Uzma Aslam Khan, Sehba Sarwar etc have all proved to be authors extraordinaire. Most of these writers, explore the issue of identity for expatriates, for Muslim women, and other social issues. Bina Shah’s <i>786 Cyber Café</i>, for exaple delves into the lives of three young Pakistani men and a young women confused about her priorities. Then there’s Kamila Shamsie’s <i>Kartography</i>, which details the life in Karachi with the protagonists belonging to the elite section of the society. Although it’s a riveting tale, it hardly depicts the life in Karachi. Or maybe it does, but then that only a very small faction of our society so full of other social evils. Since 2000, Uzma Aslam Khan, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohsin_Hamid_b7c6.html" title="Mohsin Hamid">Mohsin Hamid</a>, Saad Ashraf, Sorayya Khan and Feryal Ali Gauhar have published several consummate new novels. Mohsin Hamid's <i><a href="../../../m/o/t/Moth_Smoke_83dd.html" title="Moth Smoke">Moth Smoke</a></i> was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award and won other awards. Coming to the present era, in 2004, novels of Nadeem Aslam and Suhyal Saadi, two Pakistani-British authors, were long listed for the 2006 IMPAC Dublin Award. They have also won several other prestigious awards. Kamila Shamsie’s <i>Broken Verses</i> has also been long listed for the 2006 Prince Maurice Award.</p>
<p>A number of poetry collections were also published last year. Pakistani- British, Moniza Ali published her fifth poetry collection How the Stone Found its Voice. The first part of her collection reflects the event after the 9/11 and its effects. There was also a collection of Faiz’s poems published by OUP under the title of <i>Culture and Identity: Selected English Writings of Faiz.</i> In 2007, Mohsin Hamid's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reluctant_Fundamentalist_552b.html" title="The Reluctant Fundamentalist">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</a> was also published, exploring the effects of 9/11 on a Pakistani man in New York.</p>

<p>Last year saw a number of good autpbiographies like Salma Ahmad’s Cutting Free, Rao Rashid’s Roller Coaster: My Early Years, Shaukat Mirza’s From Exxon to Engro and several others. Then there was a reprint of Tariq Ali’s Street Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties, Nehru and the Gandhis: An Indian Dynasty. Another exciting series is that of the historical reprints by <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohatta_Palace_4d28.html" title="Mohatta Palace">Mohatta Palace</a> on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>. In Travelogues there was Salman Rashid’s Jhelum: City of Visata.</p>
<p>Previously religious books were published only in Urdu, but in the last few years the trend has changed and now a number of publishers are taking up the task of either translating major works of religion from Urdu to English or are publishing original pieces. One such place is Darussalam which is quite well known for its excellent content and quality.</p>

<p>Although there is a treasure trove of children’s books in Urdu, Pakistan fails to provide a good bookshelf of English fiction for children. There have been attempts, yes, but the market is full of international authors like <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enid_Blyton_434f.html" title="Enid Blyton">Enid Blyton</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roald_Dahl_780b.html" title="Roald Dahl">Roald Dahl</a> and the popular Sweet Valley, Famous Five, Hardy Boys etc series. Very recently, Mehnaz Malik, a Pakistani born British, published her first story book for children, which serves as a fund raiser project for The Citizen’s Foundation. Mo’s Star is a colorful story of a young penguin reaching out for the stars. The book was received with much appreciation from home and abroad and was unveiled in a colorful ceremony held in a local hotel.</p>

<p>Very close to the literary scene is the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing.html" title="Printing">printing</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing.html" title="Publishing">publishing</a> industry as the books are nothing if they don’t get a publisher or a printer. Like every other thing in the region, the printing industry is with its own sets of problems the initial ones being the unfavorable socio-economic conditions, lack of mass education and the development of local languages. Given these conditions, the establishment of the publishing industry in present day Pakistan can be traced back to the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Still, the subject matter of the books dealt mainly with religious or <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical.html" title="Philosophical">philosophical</a> themes and was also very restrained.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> bought newer printing methods, and with these improved printing methods the industry moved a step further towards development. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press.html" title="Press">Press</a> now ventured into the realms of subjects as diverse as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_thought.html" title="Islamic thought">Islamic thought</a> and literary criticism. Even more encouraging was the fact that quality books were being translated from other languages into Urdu where we lacked the expertise. These included <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> science and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commerce</a> books.</p>
<p>Another important milestone was the introduction of the printing of modern <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novels.html" title="Novels">novels</a> and short stories. <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_language.html" title="Bengali language">Bengali</a> novels were also translated to add flavor to the local literature. The <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> also bought a significant change in the industry. The printing methods were further improved and the publication industry saw a boost in sales and production with the rising literacy rates and the political awareness in the masses.</p>
<p>Since after the World War 2 the publishing industry has been steadily growing despite the many hurdles like the low purchasing power of the masses and the lack of facilities. The principle centers of publishing are <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar.html" title="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>. Lahore stands out with its numerous publishing houses and has been the hub of the industry from the pre-partition era. Even now, getting a book published from Lahore is much easier than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s publishing industry also has a lucrative market for Urdu and religious books abroad. A considerable number of books and periodicals are exported to countries like <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Africa_40aa.html" title="East Africa">East Africa</a> and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. Also, a very large number of books is imported in Pakistan mainly from <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>. The Inter-Media Growth program of Pakistan and USA have signed an agreement whereby Pakistan can import books and still pay for them in its local currency.</p>

<p>The biggest contribution of the internet in the book industry would be to digitize books and grant them a wider readership. A number of <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online.html" title="Online">online</a> websites have sprung up in the last few decades. Quite a lot of these sites are free and others charge a very nominal fee and provide unlimited access to <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebook.html" title="Ebook">ebooks</a>. They can either be <a href="../../../u/p/l/Uploading_and_downloading.html" title="Uploading and downloading">downloaded</a> or read on screen. These obviously have become popular because of easy accessibility and the low cost. In Pakistan where a huge majority of people cannot afford the expensive original foreign titles, websites like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org" rel="nofollow">Project Gutenberg</a> provide a wonderful opportunity to familiarize with foreign literature.

<p>Closely related to e-books are the online book stores, another wonder of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a>. An extension of the traditional book stores, online book stores give the option to search and read reviews of books, browse through categories, view the covers, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> information, reader ratings and then order these books online. Although they are not free and even charge a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping.html" title="Shipping">shipping</a> fee, its very convenient to search and order books online saving the hassle. Critics however say that it deprives one of having the pleasure of going through new books at a store and discovering exciting new books.

<p>Though not a new phenomenon, reading clubs are a breath of fresh air into the dying book culture. There are a number of book clubs/reading clubs online and offline. People sit and discuss their favorite books or simply talk about what they are reading these days.</p>
<p><i><b>Readers' Club</b></i> One of the exemplary example is of a "Readers'club" in Karachi University, whose moderator is Mr. Faheemuddin, Lecturer at the department of the International Relations. There is also a community of this club on the Orkut with name of <b>Readers' Club</b> and also a yahoo group <b>Readers-Club@yahoogroups.com</b>. Its sessions held six days a week.

People thronged the premises even if they didn’t really buy much. The sad thing to note was that the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> publishers had a very impressive collection of reference books on various subjects, while one finds it very difficult to find books on those topics by Pakistani publishers. Then there are also the annual book fairs held at various places especially in schools, colleges and universities. Among weekly affairs, the Koocha-e-Saqafat and Frere Hall book fairs are worth a visit. They have a huge collection of books on a wide range of topics. They are usually second hand or reprinted, although it’s a clear violation of the copyright law but a large number of Karachiites gather at the spot for book hunting.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">Copyright</a> Ordinance of 1962 came into force in 1967 in Pakistan and has been in effect since then. A number of conditions are given in the ordinance which determines when a work is in violation of copyright.</p>
<p>Pakistan is also a member of Berne Convention on copyright as well as the Universal Copyright Convention.</p>
<p>The boom in the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a> industry created a vast market for text books, both for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary.html" title="Primary">primary</a> and professional levels. Where the primary sector is largely catered to by the local <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_book.html" title="Text book">text book</a> boards, there is a serious dearth for books on professional subjects like medical, engineering or business. Thus increased the demand for <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign.html" title="Foreign">foreign</a> books. Due to import limitations the prices of these books were totally out of reach of an average Pakistani student. The <a href="http://www.nbf.sdnpk.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.nbf.sdnpk.org/" rel="nofollow">National Book Foundation</a> was set up to reprint and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Translate.html" title="Translate">translate</a> foreign titles with the permission of the original publisher. This was to make the prices affordable and within reach. But even this effort was not as successful as hoped because most of the reprinted titles were either <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsolete.html" title="Obsolete">obsolete</a> or were very old editions.</p>
<p>The grave vacuum in the industry was sensed by the pirates and so began a very successful industry of pirated books. Almost all major tiles were reprinted illegally and were sold at a fraction of the original price. Not only were text books pirated but the recent years have seen a number of local and international fiction works being pirated even before the release of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original.html" title="Original">original</a> tiles in paper back.</p>
<p>The release of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> books can be taken as a classic example of this case. The book was all set to be released on 12th of August and there was a huge hype surrounding its release. Almost all major book stores throughout the world had millions of books booked prior to the release. Even in Pakistan, a couple of leading bookstores were providing the facility of pre-ordering the book and getting a nominal discount. The price of the book was 1450 Pak rupees. But what do the pirates offer? The pirated version was in market the very next morning on a shameful price of 300 Pak rupees! A huge difference of 1150 rupees between the prices! Of course people didn’t consider it to be a bad bargain.</p>
<p>The trend of illegally reproducing books is not limited to international <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestsellers.html" title="Bestsellers">bestsellers</a>. Usually one doesn’t find the pirated version of books by Pakistani authors so easily but there is a market for such books as well. Tehmina Durrani’s <i>My Feudal Lord</i>, <a href="../../../b/a/p/Bapsi_Sidhwa_bbd7.html" title="Bapsi Sidhwa">Bapsi Sidhwa</a>’s <i>An American Brat</i>, are only but two examples.</p>
<p>When asked about the situation, <b>Bapsi Sidhwa,</b> a leading Pakistani English prose writer, says “Piracy is a problem because of the steep prices. However some pirates are developing a conscience and assigning my previously pirated books to publishers. They have made a packet off me, but so long as books are read, I don't mind as much as I should. If we have more publishers and a larger reading public, the prices could be better controlled.”</p>
<p>There have been numerous raids in the past and recently too at Urdu Bazaar for selling pirated books but all that is merely just a show and nothing has yet been done to seriously think of a solution. The piracy industry is deeply rooted and cannot be curbed with a few <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid.html" title="Raid">raids</a> on shops which don’t even print those books</p>

<p>Another menace apart from piracy is the problem of plagiarizing stuff. That is, either simply copying out whole extracts or stealing the idea or characters. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">Plagiarism</a> is an old problem and a big worry for authors who spend <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> on writing a piece of good writing and then someone else copies it and sells it at a lower cost. Then there are one-time authors who just reproduce material from some international <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> and make money by claiming it as their own. If its any comfort, then we should know that <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistanis.html" title="Pakistanis">Pakistanis</a> are not the only ones in this practice. Recently a young <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> author was under fire for stealing material from famous <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> Best Sellers. And the young writer happens to be from <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>!</p>

<p>Those who don’t reproduce work and are genuinely interested are hardly encouraged. How many good writers will actually venture into the field when the encouragement they get is only meager at best? The <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>, the <a href="../../../n/g/o/NGOs_f0a8.html" title="NGOs">NGOs</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectuals.html" title="Intellectuals">intellectuals</a> hardly ever take the initiative to encourage young and budding writers of the country. This results in most of the young authors getting their works published under <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign.html" title="Foreign">foreign</a> publishers. At least they get the recognition they warrant in foreign waters. Yet, there are a few committed souls who work tirelessly to make a place for themselves in the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> deprived country.</p>
<p>Khadija Hasan, a young <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> writer says, we should really laud the efforts of the Pakistani writers, they simply have no reason to work, and the government gives them no incentive at all. They are not facilitated in any way and rather find it difficult to work in such conditions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_and_publishing_in_Pakistan_9eb0.html" title="Edit section: Decline in reading habits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline in reading habits</span></h3>
<p>There has been a visible decline in reading habits in last few decades. This can be attributed to a number of factors like <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> and other means of entertainment. And if we look around we’ll see that there is also a dearth of good <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authors.html" title="Authors">authors</a>, people simply don’t have time to write and go through the hassle of getting a book published.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_and_publishing_in_Pakistan_9eb0.html" title="Edit section: Lack of libraries in the country">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lack of libraries in the country</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_libraries.html" title="Public libraries">Public libraries</a> used to be a lively place for one to sit down for a good read. Students and professionals used the libraries for study purposes. Ask an old timer and you’ll see how important those libraries were. That also includes the small one room libraries in every neighborhood. That trend sadly is no more. Partly because of the decline in reading habits and people just don’t find it lucrative enough to invest in. The lack of importance attached to this important institution can be gauged by the fact that recently an under construction women <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a> complex has been decided to be turned into a <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> instead. Not only would it be a waste of resources but also it will deprive the female students of a very excellent opportunity.</p>
