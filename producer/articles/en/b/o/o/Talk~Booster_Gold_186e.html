<dd>There was an origin story in Booster Gold #8-10. 30th Century Historians discovered that there was an assassination attempt on the President in 1985, and a Legion Flight Ring and Brainiac 5's Force Shield Belt were involved, as was Booster Gold. Brainiac 5, Ultra Boy and Chameleon Lad traveled back in time to investigate this. They originally assumed that Booster was behind the assassination plot, but eventually learned the truth, and assisted Booster in foiling the assassination plot. During this, Brainiac 5 gave his flight ring and force shield belt to the president to protect him. When the assassin was foiled, Brainiac 5 realized that he had to leave them behind, because these would in fact be the models that Booster would steal 500 years in the future.</dd>

<p>Is Booster really an atheist? There's nothing about it in the article.</p>
<p>--I wasn't aware Booster was an atheist either, but some quick research has turned up that this was established in JLI Annual #2. Seems to me it would be really difficult to be an atheist in the DCU what with the demons, fallen angels and whatnot everywhere you turn... <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrelghra_c9f0.html" title="User:Frelghra">Frelghra</a> 22:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Atheisism isn't neccesarily a dub-<a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiba.html" title="Kaiba">kaiba</a>-esq disbelief in the supernatural.

<dl>
<dd>Only an atheist would dub atheism as "realistic" compared to other religions. Everyone thinks their religions is realistic, or they wouldn't have it. So really, that's not all that useful a comment to make, no offense. Back to the topic at hand, if Booster IS an atheist, it should be documented in the article itself. I'd recommend removal of the category as it's far from an essential part of the character.</dd>

It has been established that this has been Booster the entire time. If the identity is picked up by another character, then we can split it off again.

<p>I'm not sure what everyone expects to happen, now that his cover is blown. Do you think he would forgo the "Booster" identity in favor of "Supernova."

<p><b>Merge</b> with a caveat: The article gets revisted after <i>52</i> ends to determine if the name needs to change.

That could be 1 of 3 options: 1) Carter as Booster, no one as Supernova; 2) Carter sa Supernova, no one as Booster; or 3) Carter as Booster, someone else as Supernova.

I wouldn't want to spoil new comic day. --<a href="../../../e/x/v/User%7EExvicious_5725.html" title="User:Exvicious">Exvicious</a> (<a href="../../../e/x/v/User_talk%7EExvicious_77ef.html" title="User talk:Exvicious">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Exvicious_c2a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Exvicious">contribs</a>) @ 23:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Ending this</b>: OK, this has gone on long enough. Wikipedia is not a Crystal Ball, and so we have to operate based on what we know now. What we know now is that Booster Gold has been using the name Supernova. The consensus seems to be to merge, with the merge to be revisited once the series is over. I'm not quite clear on the consensus for merging to Michael Carter or Booster Gold. Because the editors are being fancy, etc, it seems that Carter very possibly will continue to be Booster Gold and not Supernova, so perhaps this is just a facet of the Supernova article. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 21:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What consensus? Count those merge and delay votes. I don't see a consensus to merge. Wikipedia also has guidelines against blatant spoilers. The merge itself would be a spoiler. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 04:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Doc, where exactly is the guideline about spoilers. I can't find anything on the Project guidelines specifically barring spoilers. Treating promotional stuff with a block of salt yes, including, or excluding, spoiler information, no. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 08:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, they're not flatly barred, but guidelines do exist clearly encouraging editors to avoid spoilers. See <a href="../../../s/p/o/WP%7ESPOILER_5d48.html" title="WP:SPOILER">WP:SPOILER</a> in particular. While it stresses the need to be encyclopedic, it also recommends to avoid spoilers in edit summaries, headings, etc. Merging these spoils at the level of the topmost heading: the article title the second the reader goes to it. And what is the dang hurry? Give people a couple of months to buy the comics. We haven't refrained from adding the up-to-date information to the articles, but like the quote at <a href="../../../s/p/o/WP%7ESPOILER_5d48.html" title="WP:SPOILER">WP:SPOILER</a> says: Once you read a spoiler, you can't un-read it. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The quote it, and you, reference urges the use of spoiler warnings, not the avoidance of including spoiler information in the article text. The same goes for the guideline.<br />
It also lays out unacceptable alternatives to the spoiler tags. One of them, "Making 'spoiler free' parallel versions", seems uncomfortably close to what has happened to these two articles. To maintain both is doing just that. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 09:05, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I knew when I wrote it that it would be easy to pick out the points that don't fit what I'm saying. I'm addressing the intent of things like "It is also recommended that editors avoid placing spoilers in edit summaries or section headers (unless the spoiler warning is before the table of contents) and avoid linking from another article to a section inside the spoiler area." The biggest section header is the title itself. When you redirect, you've spoiled via title before anybody has any opportunity to see if they want to keep reading. Redirecting would certainly link from the Supernova article and into the spoiler. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 09:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah... ok. I see where you're coming from. Even the the internal heading and the wikied text can be "clean", the fact that the article title comes up is the spoiler point. Unfortunately that's going to be a sticking point for a fair chunk of time. Especially given the logical follow-up question: how long should a spoiler tag or work around be in place? X number of issues? months? indefinitely? Does it relate to the importance of the spoiler to the topic(s) involved? The reason I bring this up is that, based on some of the tags still in place in other articles, it could be years before this plot element is not considered important enough to warrant a tag. This is one of the fundamentally important twists, both to the character and the story, that would warrant a long standing tag.<br />
If that required tag is the foundation of delaying that merge, then the merge will be put off indefinitely. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 09:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to that "consensus" issue, though: I count more <b>delay</b> than <b>merge</b> votes in the survey section (10 vs. 7 at the moment). That's simply <i>not</i> a consensus to merge. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Delay" is not an appropriate response to this discussion. We are discussing the current situation. This type of thing has been discussed on <a href="../../../c/m/c/WT%7ECMC_d7a5.html" title="WT:CMC">WT:CMC</a>, and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Comics_Archive_17_0dbd.html#.22Wait_and_see.22" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 17">consensus</a> was to disallow such responses. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 10:03, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I remember the Ultimate Spider-Woman discussion. That's not the same thing. (If we're comparing Ultimate Spider-Woman to the current situation, then Supernova should never have had his own article in the first place. But like you said, we are discussing the current situation.) This is about the spoiler issue. Neither creating nor merging Ultimate Spider-Woman gave a <i>big</i> secret away. And not nearly as many people contributed to that consensus at <a href="../../../c/m/c/WT%7ECMC_d7a5.html" title="WT:CMC">WT:CMC</a> as voted in the survey above. In the section you cite, it looks like it was 4 to 2. I realize other discussions had occured elsewhere, but you only brought up the consensus at WT:CMC (which was a majority, but not an overwhelming consensus at that).</dd>
<dd>I personally am not making any kind of "wait and see" argument, although I realize somebody has. Based on what we have now, I fully expect a merger. We already know Booster has been Supernova. One interviewee's insinuation that several people might be Booster is meaningless because we were also told in interviews that Booster was absolutely, positively dead. But the redirect itself will be an unfair spoiler at this time. For now, despite your remark that we have a consensus to merge, we certainly do not. The majority of people surveyed said we should delay. Just as one user should <i>never</i> have posted the Booster/Supernova spoiler in an edit summary, we shouldn't spoil via the redirect right now.
<dl>
<dd>The only harm it might possibly do does not relate to Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia. If people do not want to be spoiled on something, they shouldn't come to Wikipedia to read about it. I, as an experienced user, feel capable of coming to the site with minor spoiling, but I understand the risk I am taking. But seriously: The harm in your instance is someone being informed of something, and that is Wikipedia's goal. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 01:20, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know the essay on arguments to avoid during AfD, CfD, etc. It recommends avoiding "It does no harm." A lot of us are saying the opposite of that, though. We're saying that the merge at this time would do some harm (well, to people's enjoyment, that is).

<p>2 Cents---- DC has said Booster is 'gone'... I think that they'll keep the Supernova character and toss Booster persona. So, there.Notadot 00:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we should merge the article but redirect <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernova_%28comics%29.html" title="Supernova (comics)">Supernova (comics)</a> to 52. That way if you don't know, you go to 52. And if you go to 52, you know there will be spoilers and if you get spoiled you want more info and you go to Booster Gold.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid spoilers in booster gold don't name the section 'supernova' name it 52 with the spoilers tag. --<b><a href="../../../e/x/v/User_talk%7EExvicious_77ef.html" title="User talk:Exvicious">EXV</a></b> // <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Exvicious_c2a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Exvicious">+</a> @ 08:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hasn't it been said by Geoff Johns that he plans on starting a new Booster Gold series? This could mean they're going to keep Carter as Booster and it has been said by the editors that there's more then one Supernova anyway hasn't it?</p>

<li>The purported new series is mentioned, with cites and "crystal ball" tags, in the article.</li>
<li>Is there a <i>recent</i> cite about the likelihood of additional Supernova characters? Old ones are just as valid as <i>52'</i>s editors proclaiming that Ralph <i>wasn't</i> drinking Gingold during the series.</li>
<li>Without #2 the existence of other characters using the Supernova ID is just fan spec and <i>should not</i> be in the article.</li>

<p>I think we should move this article to one called "Michael Jon Carter", because other characters that have had more than one identity have been moved to pages with their real names (e.g. Speedball (comics) to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbie_Baldwin_642c.html" title="Robbie Baldwin">Robbie Baldwin</a>).

<dd>Superman's article is titled <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> even though he has gone by names like Nightwing. Booster was Supernova only briefly. In fact, temporally, he was both Supernova and Booster Gold at the same time through most of Supernova's appearances. He has an upcoming series as Booster Gold. "Supernova" was never a name change. It was a disguise. So no, this doesn't work.
<p>You posted your comment saying you "think" we should move this article and you moved it in the same day. That's premature.
