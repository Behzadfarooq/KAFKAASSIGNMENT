<p>I added details with regard to the attacks upon Ai and the Israelite losses, the cause for the defeat (from the Book of Joshua's standpoint) and the process (urim and thummim, presumably) used to discover Achan and his wrongdoing. In defense of this, I think it clarified the passage and leads the reader to further learning (examining the ancient urim and thummim process by reading the further article.)</p>
<p>Additionally, I added reference to the viewpoint of God as supposedly unjust in ordering the extermination of the Canaanites. <a href="../../../t/t/w/User%7ETTWSYF_1b85.html" title="User:TTWSYF">TTWSYF</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Much as you tried to be objective in adding this information, it still comes over as POV. Consider the following statement:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another difficulty arises out of the command given by God to completely exterminate the Canaanites. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" On the other hand, archaeology has discovered that the Canaanites were an extremely depraved society and frequently practised child sacrifice (burning the infant victims alive); from this point of view, the command to exterminate the Canaanites is viewed by some as just.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. You use "depraved" without any reference to what you consider depraved behavior to be. Are they simply depraved because they are of the wrong religion, eat the wrong kinds of food, or allow their women to walk around half-dressed? If they are depraved because they practiced child sacrifice, then take that clause out of your sentence &amp; let the fact of child sacrifice speak for itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Actually, it is more accurate to say they <i>allegedly</i> practiced child sacrifice. You claim that "archaeology" has found evidence of this; where was the evidence for this found? Finds of child sacrifice would be sensational, &amp; obviously be reprinted in newspapers &amp; news magazines around the world. I have more than a passing interest in archeology, &amp; I would have remembered reading any report of child sacrifice, especially in what was Canaan, where this practice was alleged. (But if you provide the proof &amp; sources for this allegation, I'll happily concede this point.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. You do admit that this practice would justify the extermination of this people; &amp; I doubt many would defend a culture that practices human -- let alone child -- sacrifice. Would you also admit to the possibility that these charges were invented either at the time or later to justify this act of extermination? George W. Bush is hardly the first person in history to fudge the facts to justify a war he wanted to wage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope you see that to make a truly NPOV statement about child sacrifice in ancient Canaan requires more work than you have done. What you have written may have a factual basis; but as it currently reads, what you have added is nothing more than tinder for Yet Another Edit War on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:24, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do you feel that the article was, previous to my modifications, truly NPOV? It was criticizing the Bible, putting forth the typical mamby pamby attitude "oh those poor Canaanites and that wicked, wicked God for ordering the Israelites to kill them..." etc. There are firm archaeological findings supporting the Canaanite's practices of child sacrifice, sex worship, the practice of compulsory male and female temple prostitution, and further behaviors I would term depraved. I will place those references here. The latest iteration is not bad, but I question the need for the entire section. <a href="../../../t/t/w/User%7ETTWSYF_1b85.html" title="User:TTWSYF">TTWSYF</a></p>
<p>Ok, here is the reference:</p>
<p><i>The Bible Handbook</i>, by Henry H. Halley, notes that at Megiddo, archaeologists found the ruins of a temple of Ashtoreth, goddess-wife of Baal. He writes: “Just a few steps from this temple was a cemetery, where many jars were found, containing remains of infants who had been sacrificed in this temple . . . Prophets of Baal and Ashtoreth were official murderers of little children.” “Another horrible practice was [what] they called ‘foundation sacrifices.’ When a house was to be built, a child would be sacrificed, and its body built into the wall.” Halley comments: “The worship of Baal, Ashtoreth, and other Canaanite gods consisted in the most extravagant orgies; their temples were centers of vice. . . . Canaanites worshiped, by immoral indulgence, . . . and then, by murdering their first-born children, as a sacrifice to these same gods. It seems that, in large measure, the land of Canaan had become a sort of Sodom and Gomorrah on a national scale. . . . Did a civilization of such abominable filth and brutality have any right longer to exist? . . . Archaeologists who dig in the ruins of Canaanite cities wonder that God did not destroy them sooner than He did.”</p>
<p>That's one reference; Halley is viewed as an authority in many circles. I have to dust off some other old tomes to pull up further research. Thanks, <a href="../../../t/t/w/User%7ETTWSYF_1b85.html" title="User:TTWSYF">TTWSYF</a></p>
<p>Back with some more references.</p>
<p>"Excavations in Palestine have brought to light a multitude of A[starte] figures in all forms; . . . most of them are small, crude figures, an indication that this deity was chiefly used in home worship, perhaps worn by women on their person or placed in an alcove in the house. . . . The sensual nature religions of A[starte] and Baal appealed to the common folk. Of course, serious injury was inevitable; sexual perversions in honor of the deity, voluptuous lust, and impassioned exuberance became a part of worship and later moved into the home."—Calwer Bibellexikon (Calwer Bible Lexicon).</p>
<p>"Religious festivities became a degraded celebration of the animal side of human nature. Even Greek and Roman writers were shocked by the things the Canaanites did in the name of religion."—The Lion Encyclopedia of the Bible.</p>
<p>"Of Canaanite religious practices, mention will only be made here of the sacrificing of children, for excavations have directly verified this. In Gezer as well as in Megiddo, the way corpses of children are immured . . . speaks conclusively . . . for this practice."—Die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft (Science of the Old Testament).</p>
<p>"In no country has so relatively great a number of figurines of the naked goddess of fertility, some distinctly obscene, been found. Nowhere does the cult of serpents appear so strongly. . . . Sacred courtesans and eunuch priests were excessively common. Human sacrifice was well known . . . The aversion felt by followers of YHWH-God when confronted by Canaanite idolatry, is accordingly, very easy to understand."—Recent Discoveries in Bible Lands.</p>
<p>Hope these will be sufficient; thanks, <a href="../../../t/t/w/User%7ETTWSYF_1b85.html" title="User:TTWSYF">TTWSYF</a></p>

<p>I see HBH is a primary source for this article, however I should mention -- and I hope this doesn't offend anyone -- that Mr. Halley was unabashedly non-neutral in his endeavors with this text. He believed that everyone should read the Bible every day, and his intended readership were liturgical "Bible readers" of the early 20th century. This *is* a source, but is is not a neutral (or current) one. I see that the text I've deleted on non-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOVgrounds</a> is by TTWSYF, so apologies to TTWSYF in advance. --</p>
<p>THis project has become tedious to the extreme. Anyone attempting to add any information or modifications sees their additions deleted out of hand. What a waste of time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've reinstated previous sections on the ethical problem of war in Joshua, but added dissenting views and placed everything in what I hope is NPOV language. If anyone still has problems, feel free to edit or to add additional information to make it more NPOV. However, I don't think it is justifiable to remove the section altogether, as this is a serious issue that people studying the Joshua need to deal with, whatever the conclusions they reach may be. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneydew_3633.html" title="User:Honeydew">honeydew</a> 10:04, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added some info on the excavations of Canaanite cities and what they show about the Israelite invasion. I'm not sure what to write about the city of Jericho because the evidence is vague. There was a Canaanite city in the late bronze age and it was destroyed the same time as other canaanite cities. However, the city was not very large and no traces of walls from that period were found. It's possible that the rubble of the walls was all taken away to build something else later. Should I even mention it? --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 05:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have a separate article on <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua.html" title="Joshua">Joshua</a> most of which is from the 1906 public domain Jewish Encyclopedia. I don't see much point in having a separate article on Joshua, as that article mostly recounts the events of the book anyway. The 1906 article can be added to Wikisource and linked from here. So I suggest a merger of any unique material of the Joshua article into this, and a redirect.

<p>Archeologists do NOT know when the Exodus occurred. What is known is that the Israelites settled across the hill country of central Israel around the 12th century. And, Israel is mentioned by name in the 13th century. Moreover the Christian biblical chronology puts the Exodus in the 15th century whereas the Jewish biblical chronology put it in the 13th century. Archeological evidence makes both of these traditional dates difficult. By itself this sentence is wrong: "Excavations of several Canaanite cities have provided contradictory evidence for establishing the historicity of the Book of Joshua." Rather, it's the way religious traditions have timed and reconstructed the events which are untenable. The biblical text itself is complex, for example Joshua with a quick conquest versus Judges with a slow one. Many archeologists believe the biblical Exodus may echo the expulsion of the Hyksos, and if so it refers to an event in the 16th century which would agree with archeological record, even if the recording of it was largely legendary (similar to the legends of about Bronze Age Troy). --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 02:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is about what can be sourced, not about what traditions you yourself may have determined to be 'untenable'. If you would only include your source for these ideas, it's all a very simple matter - especially if you are contradicting what previous editors have written. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 02:56, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
