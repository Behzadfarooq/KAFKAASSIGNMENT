<p>Why did you change all the articles about Nashville TV stations to eliminate -TV/DT? Those ARE the official call letters for each, are they not? --<a href="../../../z/p/b/User%7EZpb52_d9a3.html" title="User:Zpb52">Zpb52</a> 07:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That doesn't matter. Any station that broadcasts using the same call letters on both TV band and DT band MUST carry the -TV or -DT suffix. In the interim (that is, until analog TV is phased out and DT becomes the standard), stations carry both suffixes in the -TV/DT format. It is similar to the rule about FM or TV stations that use the same call letters as AM stations. Take WSB in Atlanta, for example. AM is the default band, so there is no such thing as an -AM suffix. However, channel 2 must carry the WSB-TV suffix and 98.5 must carry the -FM suffix in addition to the WSB call letters. When you go to the FCC's website, as you instructed me to do, it gives you information on all stations carrying those call letters, whether they be TV or DT. Because the same call letters are being used on both TV and DT bands, the suffixes must be added until one or the other goes away. --<a href="../../../z/p/b/User%7EZpb52_d9a3.html" title="User:Zpb52">Zpb52</a> 08:55, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thought I'd weigh in on this topic. There are alot of U.S. TV stations that are licenced with a callsign ending with -TV, some with -LP, and some with -CA. Most are just the call lettters with no postfix. However there are currently only 9, yes nine, stations licenced by the FCC with a callsign ending with -DT. There are currently more stations with -DR callsigns (17) then that. I got these numbers by doing an FCC database search by state, for each state, and searched the results for the string '-D'. This gave me hits for both -DT and -DR stations. If all stations have call letters with -TV or -DT at the end, why are they not listed as such in the FCC database? Please show me a rule or law from an official government site stating what you claim. —<a href="../../../%D0%B0/_/_/User%7E%D0%90_9fd1.html" title="User:А">A</a> 09:04, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh forgot to include this, I have compiled the list of all stations that have a callsign ending in either -DT or -DR. If anyone finds anymore please add them to a list. If it ever gets over 20 or so stations I'll move it to a non-user page. <a href="../../../%D0%B0/2F/-/User%7E%D0%90_-DT_Television_stations_76a0.html" title="User:А/-DT Television stations">User:А/-DT Television stations</a> —<a href="../../../%D0%B0/_/_/User%7E%D0%90_9fd1.html" title="User:А">A</a> 09:07, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One last thing. Article names are to be the fcc assigned call letters of the station the article is about with very few exceptions. As I say in the template I use for renaming station articles: "Consensus on both <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html#Broadcasting" title="WP:NC">WP:NC#Broadcasting</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Television_Stations_b3b8.html#Article_names" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Television Stations">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television_Stations#Article_names</a> is that the article name should reflect the actual call letters of the TV station." If anyone doesn't like this, it should be discussed at one of those locations. As per the content of the page, I usualy only change the call letters in an infobox and leave the text how it is. However, I always remove the -DT unless the station is one of the sacred 9. Using this moniker with a callsign is just a marketing tool and not factual. This is an encyclopedia, so unless you are talking about how "this station uses the -DT at the end of their call sign even though it is not their call sign" or something along those lines, we should leave it off wikipedia. —<a href="../../../%D0%B0/_/_/User%7E%D0%90_9fd1.html" title="User:А">A</a> 09:28, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Boothy, thanks for seprataing fact from "so called fact" when it comes to the history of Philadelphia city and county.

<p>I've protected 3 of the Philadelphia pages Evrik and you have been reverting for most of last month. I deliberately did not add protection tags to the pages because I do not want to see two productive editors actively monitor those pages only to revert each other. I will periodically lift the protection so that others can edit the page, but if the reversions continue without some significant dialog, I will be inclined to issue reciprocal blocks. The reversions have gone on long enough, and it is time that both of you initiate some generosity and graciousness towards the other party. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 06:10, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Boothy, I just wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evrik&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39540010" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evrik&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39540010" rel="nofollow">this</a> to Evrik, and I think it would apply to you as well. In the past month, have you tried to approach Evrik about those articles, either on his talk page, or on the article/category talk pages? It is clear that commenting in the edit summary during your reversions does not suffice to end the edit dispute between the two of you. I'm quite aware that at the moment, you and Evrik have no inclination to communicate with each other - but if you intend to revert those pages, it would not be an unreasonable request to make yourself approachable to others. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:15, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia lists Philadelphia as a consolidated city-county. Any article that doesn't belong directly in the Philadelphia Category and is related to the County, probably belongs elsewhere (like Philaelphia History Category).<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 06:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Please let me know what your thoughts are then: what would help end the dispute? In the current situation, I am a neutral party between you and Evrik. If I participate on your RfAr, I may not be - I haven't looked at any of the material related to your RfAr yet. If I do this, I will have to step away from monitoring those 3 pages. Would this help resolve the dispute? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 05:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Boothy443, I noticed the nice image you have uploaded for <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Plunkett_4fab.html" title="Oliver Plunkett">Oliver Plunkett</a>. I would like to use it for the corresponding article in the German language edition of the Wikipedia. Unfortunately, however, this image has not been uploaded to the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Commons</a> yet and I cannot do this myself as its copyright status remains unclear. Currently, it is just tagged <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> without giving a detailed qualification (because of its age, for example). I would appreciate a more detailed copyright status information or an upload to the Commons. In this context it would be helpful to note the name of the artist, the time when it was drawn (if known), and a reference from where it has been taken.

<p>Hi there. I was wondering why you thought it was necessary to remove categories <a href="../../../n/o/r/Category%7ENorthern_Irish_football_clubs_ea6a.html" title="Category:Northern Irish football clubs">Category:Northern Irish football clubs</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Category%7ESport_in_Northern_Ireland_ef9b.html" title="Category:Sport in Northern Ireland">Category:Sport in Northern Ireland</a> on the club pages. I can understand removing the euro-footy stubs, but I don't understand the category removals. I've no objection to it of course, if there is a reasonable explaination.&#160;:)</p>
<p>PS. Apologies for putting the warning in the wrong place. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 22:08, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand about the categories now. Thank you. But two things about them. Firstly: are you sure they work properly, given the top-level category use only? And secondly - I created that other Category for a reason. I can't remember exactly the reason, but I think there was something that wasn't working regarding sub-cats, and so I needed to create that cat for it to work. Also, I think the category "Northern Irish" is more in keeping with the "English" and "Scottish" equivalent categories.. and opposed to the existing "Northern Ireland" and non-existant "England" and "Scotland" etc. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 19:03, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah it iwll take a day or to to go threw, and the change so only be done to the template so, hopefully, the change on all of the related articls should be automatic, if not and i dont catch it before you, just let me know. I am guessing you dont have a problem with the Sport in cat beeing taken out of the article it on, i'll hold off removing it for now. I might in the mean time, depening on what else i get caught up in, change the stubs over from uefa to ni. --Boothy443 | trácht ar 06:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No probs. Regarding the Sport cat - as long as the football clubs somehow get included in the category, I'm sure there is no problem. All I was wanting to do was to ensure that all the categories that are relevent point to the NI footy clubs.. for people that might want to look up information about them. Maybe you should change the articles and test out the cats to see. I'll continue adding info to the clubs when I get the time anyway.

<p>Just look above. I thanked you first off, then I wished you a nice day, then I offered to help you, and all of this from a statement of an accepted opinion -- you are renowned for being rude and obstinent on Wikipedia. And in return, you troll, and yet i'm still not angry at you. Hell, like I said before, if anything, i'm honored by your trolling, usually you don't talk to people at all. I must be worth your time since you keep on talking to me.

<p>I think responding to you stopped me just enough to prevent me from reaching my goal of 1,000 edits this wikiday(7:05 where I am), then again, I did have almost zero edits last night. However, since you enjoy making people feel bad, and I enjoy making people happy(which in your case would be making someone feel bad), you can take credit for me not reaching that plateau if you'd like. I personally think 819 edits in one day is fairly impressive regardless, and there'll always be more days, plus giving you credit for sabotaging me is a good deed in itself(per the above), so the karma's building up for me. The only way it could be better is if you opposed my re-rfa like you always do, then people would say "Well, if Boothy hates him, he can't be all that bad." Then again, there is a better way of going through live than the path you've taken, in my opinion. But to each their own. I'll be around if you want to try a different way of doing things. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4">Karm</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00">a</font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636">fist</font></a> 00:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fair point.

<p>Boothy443, I read your request that IP address 138.67.56.42 stop vandalizing pages. I'm sorry to tell you that this address belongs to a public computer in the Colorado School of Mines's Arthur Lakes library. I don't know who was vandalizing pages, but your threat of discipline won't have much effect on them; this room alone has ten other computers, so your best bet is that the user immediately feels (felt) sorry.</p>
<p>(I hardly ever edit pages at all, except for proofreading- which reminds me; there's a greengrocer's apostrophe in the "Film" article. I'll go fix that now.)</p>

<p>Cheers Boothy. I'm a bit busy with specific projects at the minute to be active about this person .. and I haven't looked at enough of his edits to know if what you're saying is true. But certainly, if he is guilty of half the things you say he is, he could be considered a Vandal. Changing others' comments is NOT on. On a personal level, I don't think that every article needs the Irish translation, but on the other hand, most of them should have it. To remove them just because they happen to be there is another no-no. When I get the chance, I'll start to watch him though.

Also note that my edits did not modify the "format" of the templates (that is, how they appear when used; at least it shouldn't have affected their appearance; if it did, let me know and I'll try and figure out what went wrong).</p>
<p>But it's really very important we get away from using hiddenStructure: my intent is to have it removed from <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">MediaWiki:Common.css</a> as soon as it's no longer used.

<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, Wikipedia accessibility trumps any concern over readability of template code. Further, this is hardly a "personal crusade"; a number of editors have agreed that using hiddenStructure is a bad idea (a blind Wikipedian has left a comment as recently as January stating that hiddenStructure (and more generally, "CSS hacks") should not be used; there's a diff link at the bottom of User:Locke Cole/Don't use hiddenStructure if you don't believe me). That it is a personal subpage and not a Wikipedia page is irrelevant: I have no intention of making this a policy because it will inevitably be a shortlived one (as soon as hiddenStructure is out of use, it will be removed as quickly as possible from <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">MediaWiki:Common.css</a>). Another reason I made it a userspace page was because I wanted to avoid repeating the same statement on Template talk pages. The developers have already said that they plan on adding conditional syntax to MediaWiki (Brion VIBBER, lead developer of MediaWiki, has said this on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WT%7EAUM_1fff.html" title="WT:AUM">WT:AUM</a>). Brion also said that hiddenStructure is bad (again, see quote/diff on my userspace page). So as you can see, there's nothing to talk to the developers about: they'll get conditionals implemented as soon as they can, but they've also said hiddenStructure is awful and shouldn't be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, regarding your first comment about the lack of discussion, I have two things to say to you: 1) There has been discussion about this, and most people who have participated agree that hiddenStructure is bad and should not be used when there are methods available to reach the same results (and keep Wikipedia accessible to the disabled). 2) This is a Wiki, not everything requires discussion (especially when it's a minor change like this).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please let me know if there's anything else I can explain for you. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 06:29, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I want to apologize if it seems like I'm trying to force anything. As you may or may not have noticed, I haven't reverted you (nor will I). I leave the choice up to you (or another editor, if they choose to intervene) on this entirely. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 06:42, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done my best to explain it, I'm sorry I haven't convinced you. I did want to correct you though: the developers <b>did not</b> create hiddenStructure. It was created by one editor, and a sysop added it to <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">MediaWiki:Common.css</a> with (as far as I know) no discussion. The developers generally don't force things, but rather leave it to the editors of the Wiki to sort out. Now whether you believe myself and a number of other editors constitutes "sorting it out" is up to you. As far as it being a "crusade", I reject that: I'm just trying to move away from it as quickly as possible for the reasons I've stated (it negatively impacts disabled readers, and it negatively impacts Wikipedia). For what it's worth, I've "fixed" something like 50+ templates and the two involving you are the only ones I've met any significant resistance with. As I said above, the choice is yours, I will not revert war with you over it. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 09:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've addressed some of your concerns: the width is fixed, I added the website spacer line, and the population now functions correctly (if any one of the three population variables is present, it will be displayed). However, I'm not sure what you mean by "problems with the background color" for the statistics table. Right now it looks exactly the same as the old infobox, and there shouldn't be any issues if we wanted to change the background colors.</dd>
<dd>Also, I chose to use the conditional templates because they are easier to read and it will be easier to replace them when the native MediaWiki code is added. I don't see any problems using them... if the template needs to be changed and they act quirky, just let me know and we can find a solution. Hiddenstructure is a horrible, horrible hack--because of the way it works, we have no idea if it will work in browsers that we haven't tested. ~<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">MDD</a><a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html" title="User talk:Mdd4696">46</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdd4696_369b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdd4696">96</a> 19:03, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been suggested by <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">User:BrianSmithson</a> that the Beer and brewery categories should be renamed. The proposal has been supported by <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">User:Syrthiss</a>, and supported and expanded by myself. The notion is that the regional categories should follow the format of "Beer and breweries in Africa" /Europe/Asia/North America/South America/Oceania. "Brewers and breweries" could also be renamed "Beer and breweries by region". And all the countries should also be renamed (and merged if needed) as, for example, "Beer and breweries of Germany", "Beer and breweries of Britain", "Beer and breweries of Poland". The word in each case would be beer rather than beers to allow for general articles on beer culture in each region as well as individual beers.</p>

<dd>Thanks for finding that info.
