<p>The film depicts the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornographic.html" title="Pornographic">pornographic</a> film industry of the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> as seen through the life of a young <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">porn star</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirk_Diggler_c99c.html" title="Dirk Diggler">Dirk Diggler</a>, who is played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Wahlberg_852f.html" title="Mark Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>. This film details how he was discovered by porn director Jack Horner (based on William Margold), played by <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Reynolds_1d5d.html" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>. It then shows how Diggler enters the business, his rise to stardom, and his eventual downfall, partly due to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>-induced <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> and having become an arrogant "star". It ends with his reconciliation with Horner.</p>
<p>Dirk's rise and fall serves as a way to explore a number of characters and the fashions and foibles of the late 1970s and early 1980s. All the characters experience a variety of highs and lows as the plot intertwines the stories of the characters Jack, Amber, Buck, Rollergirl, and Dirk.</p>
<p>Jack discovers a young Eddie Adams working in a nightclub and shortly after recruits him into the industry. Eddie adopts the moniker Dirk Diggler and quickly becomes an adult film celebrity, winning several adult film awards and spending his earnings on clothes, shoes, a new apartment, and his most prized possession, a "competition orange" Corvette.</p>

<p>In a lengthy sequence, the film moves from one character to another showing the audience their attempts and failures to make lives for themselves after they have left Jack's adult film family. Jack himself becomes rather redundant in his porno empire after his main source of funding, the Colonel James, is imprisoned for possession of child pornography. His new source of funding insists upon shooting on the lower-cost videotape and using amateur actors. Jack dislikes the lower-quality videotape format and becomes bored with the films that are now being produced without the effort of script, character development, or direction. Jack tries a new angle to revitalize his career, employing Rollergirl to ride around with him in a limousine enticing random strangers to have sex with her on film. The ploy goes very badly when the man they choose at random knows Rollergirl from high school and insults her. She and Jack beat him severely and leave him bleeding on the street.</p>
<p>Jack's cameraman, Little Bill (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Macy_3129.html" title="William H. Macy">William H. Macy</a>) is married to who appears to be another porn star (played by real-life porn queen <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Hartley_278d.html" title="Nina Hartley">Nina Hartley</a>) who constantly cheats and humiliates him in public such as engaging in intercourse with a man at a party in front of everyone. Later at a New Years Eve party after discovering his wife again cheating on him in one of the bedrooms, he goes to his car and retrieves a revolver and shoots both of them and then himself in front of the party crowd.</p>
<p>Amber finds herself in a nasty custody battle with her former husband over their child. The court determines that she is unfit to be a mother.</p>
<p>Buck Swope marries another porn star, Jessie St. Vincent, who, shortly thereafter, becomes pregnant. After being denied a loan to open a stereo store, Buck stops at a donut shop and is caught up in a robbery. In a strange twist of fate, the clerk, thief, and a gun-wielding customer who tries to stop the robbery all wind up dead and Buck escapes with the money the thief would have otherwise stolen. He uses this to open an appliance store.</p>
<p>Dirk becomes addicted to cocaine and has a violent falling out with Jack during a shoot. He and Reed leave to pursue their dream of forming an early-'80s rock band; however, they are unable to pay for their studio recording time. Dirk tries to prostitute himself but is assaulted by a gang of thugs. Dirk and Reed, along with their mutual friend, Todd (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jane_dc89.html" title="Thomas Jane">Thomas Jane</a>), attempt to scam an associate, Rahad Jackson (<a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Molina_a372.html" title="Alfred Molina">Alfred Molina</a>), into purchasing a half-<a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilo</a> of baking soda, which they claim is cocaine. During the deal, Todd attempts a much larger robbery and is subsequently killed during the ensuing gunfight. (The incident is loosely based on the real life <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonderland_Murders_9328.html" title="Wonderland Murders">Wonderland Murders</a>.) Dirk and Reed barely escape the house alive. Shortly after this, Dirk returns to Jack's house and the two reconcile. Dirk re-enters the adult industry and most of the characters appear to be living in Jack's house, their version of a family.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boogie_Nights_6746.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>The idea of <i>Boogie Nights</i> wasn't developed until well after Paul Thomas Anderson made the short <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mockumentary.html" title="Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> <i>The Dirk Diggler Story</i> on home video in 1988. The project was inspired by Anderson's infatuation with the absurdities of pornography and behind-the-scenes stories of porn stars. In particular, <i>The Dirk Diggler Story</i> was influenced by a documentary called <i>Exhausted</i> that featured <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Holmes_%28actor%29_3609.html" title="John Holmes (actor)">John Holmes</a> as its subject. The documentary was directed by Julia St. Vincent and Anderson describes it as a "love letter" to Holmes, (the documentary itself goes as far as to label Holmes as a "love god"). Both the documentary and Holmes would have large impacts on the <i>Boogie Nights</i> characters Dirk Diggler and Amber Waves.</p>
<p>After Anderson had completed the dismal experience of writing and directing his first feature film <i>Sydney</i> (renamed <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Eight_%28film%29_db5c.html" title="Hard Eight (film)">Hard Eight</a></i> by the studio) he went to work writing <i>Boogie Nights</i> with <i>The Dirk Diggler Story</i> as a starting point. The script would eventually become a gargantuan, 185 page story that featured many interweaving character plots about individuals in the pornography industry, almost all of them being inspired by real life accounts that Anderson had researched over the years. Not only was it a lengthy story, but its subject matter alone gave distributors the notion that it was an impossible film to sell.</p>
<p>However, Mike De Luca at New Line Cinema supported Anderson and the script entirely. De Luca had missed out on the opportunity to get behind various, critically acclaimed projects such as <i><a href="../../../r/u/s/Rushmore_%28film%29.html" title="Rushmore (film)">Rushmore</a></i> and he refused to let <i>Boogie Nights</i> get past him. Eventually, New Line would green-light the script assuming that the nostalgic 1970s setting and outstanding soundtrack would be enough to market the picture. The only conditions were that the film not go over its low $15 million budget and that it ensure an R rating from the <a href="../../../m/p/a/MPAA_c23d.html" title="MPAA">MPAA</a> (rather than an NC-17 rating, as Anderson had originally envisioned). Both conditions were implemented to see that the film would make a profit for New Line.</p>
<p>Rather than playing it safe and trying to please other people, as was the case with <i>Hard Eight</i>, Anderson shot every scene of the script and was unwilling to cut much out of the film. His stubborn attitude towards studio executives would only worsen when the film was first screened for test audiences. Many people were expecting a light, nostalgic 1970s comedy about pornography and were instead shown a long, drawn-out, dark and complicated drama. Support of the project began to wane until critics saw the film and began showering it with praise. In its eventual theater release, it made a modest $26 million (a larger profit wouldn't be made until its video release). To date (12/2006) the film has grossed $43,101,594 internationally, $26,400,640 in the USA and $16,700,954 overseas. Mainly, it was the film's critical success that kept Anderson at New Line for his next film, <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnolia_%28film%29.html" title="Magnolia (film)">Magnolia</a></i>.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirk_Diggler_c99c.html" title="Dirk Diggler">Dirk Diggler</a></b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Wahlberg_852f.html" title="Mark Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>)- Born Eddie Adams, Dirk is a handsome but dimwitted high school dropout with a 13-inch <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> who is recruited into the porn industry by director Jack Horner. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an instant success in the porn world. In the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> he gets hooked on <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and after a dispute with Jack leaves his studio. Dirk is the central character in the story and the one who has the greatest effect on all the other characters. Dirk's character is largely inspired by the life of the priapic porn king, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Holmes_%28actor%29_3609.html" title="John Holmes (actor)">John C. Holmes</a> (who, ironically, is referenced briefly in the film).</p>
<p><b>Jack Horner</b> (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Reynolds_1d5d.html" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>) - A successful director of pornographic films. He meets Eddie Adams in a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reseda%2C_California_15ac.html" title="Reseda, California">Reseda, California</a>, and convinces him to consider a career in adult cinema. He's a wise, kind and fatherly figure who has formed close, caring relationships with many of his regular cast and crew. His dream is to direct films that are not simply sexy, but have stories that grip the audience even after they've climaxed. His chance to make such a film ultimately comes along with the first Brock Landers film. The Jack Horner character has been attributed to an amalgam of porn moguls such as William Margold, Bob Chinn, and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Amerson_b515.html" title="Bill Amerson">Bill Amerson</a>.</p>
<p><b>Amber Waves</b> (<a href="../../../j/u/l/Julianne_Moore_2a0d.html" title="Julianne Moore">Julianne Moore</a>) - The star female actress in Jack Horner's stable of porn stars. She's a cocaine addict and also has serious emotional issues - these are the main reasons she's lost the custody of her son to her ex-husband. Amber's son is never seen in the movie and the closest he comes to her is an unsuccessful attempt to call her. She falls in love with Dirk soon after meeting him and essentially takes him on as a new son. Her care is not always beneficial, however, and she introduces Dirk to cocaine. Later he becomes addicted to drugs. Amber's real name is Maggie. Much of the inspiration for this character was from Julia St. Vincent, girlfriend of John Holmes. However, Julia was never a porn starlet.</p>
<p><b>Rollergirl</b> (<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heather_Graham_340c.html" title="Heather Graham">Heather Graham</a>) - A very attractive, frequent talent of Jack's films who never takes off her roller skates. Though she is in high school at the beginning of her pornography career, she, like Dirk, drops out of school and with Jack caring for her. She is "adopted" by Amber as a daughter after Dirk leaves Jack's studio to pursue other interests. Rollergirl's real name is Brandy.</p>
<p><b>Reed Rothchild</b> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Reilly_066f.html" title="John C. Reilly">John C. Reilly</a>) - A veteran of the industry, Reed becomes Dirk's best friend. Reed is an egocentric who tries to appear more knowledgeable and multi-talented than he really is. He and Dirk create and star in their own porno series in the late 70s, get hooked on cocaine at the same time, and leave Jack's studio at the same time. Reed's one true aspiration outside of porn is to be a magician.</p>
<p><b>Buck Swope</b> (<a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Cheadle_2629.html" title="Don Cheadle">Don Cheadle</a>) - A black stereo salesman and porn star. Buck relentlessly tries to find a fashion style that suits him, and ends up showcasing some of the wilder forms of dress of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. He marries fellow porn star Jessie St. Vincent and she soon becomes pregnant. During the 80s, Buck tries to open his own stereo store, but his loan application is turned down by the bank because of his ties to pornography. He later opens the store after taking the money from a botched robbery in which the robber and all other occupants ended up dead.</p>
<p><b>Scotty J.</b> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Seymour_Hoffman_4463.html" title="Philip Seymour Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>) - A shy and nervous member of Jack's filming crew. Scotty J. works menial positions behind the camera, mostly as <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boom_operator_%28media%29.html" title="Boom operator (media)">boom operator</a>. He falls in love with Dirk the first time he sees him. Scotty idolizes and emulates Dirk and at one point during a drunken stupor even tries to kiss him, but gets rejected. However, along with Reed, Scotty follows and supports Dirk even after his falling out with Jack.</p>

She and Buck Swope discover a mutual love of sunrises, and fall in love. The name of this character is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Julia St. Vincent, whose biography of John Holmes, "Exhausted" provided some of the actual scenes used in the documentary sequence of Boogie Nights.</p>
<p><b>Becky Barnett</b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Ari_Parker_3ca6.html" title="Nicole Ari Parker">Nicole Ari Parker</a>) - A black porn star featured in many of Jack's films.

He is seen frequently with young petite women and is eventually arrested in the '80s for an undisclosed crime involving one or more underage girls.

<p><b>Floyd Gondolli</b> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Baker_Hall_2d64.html" title="Philip Baker Hall">Philip Baker Hall</a>) - A rising producer of the industry. Prior to The Colonel's arrest he tries to convince Jack to start shooting his movies on videotape, but Jack refuses. After the arrest, Jack has nobody to go to for funding except Floyd, and Floyd will only fund video projects. As a result, Jack starts shooting his movies with video.</p>
<p><b>Todd Parker</b> (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jane_dc89.html" title="Thomas Jane">Thomas Jane</a>) - A close friend of Reed's. He's a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stripper.html" title="Stripper">stripper</a> at a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> called Party Boys, but also supplies <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> for Reed and Dirk.

<p>One major sequence was removed near the theatrical release of the film. The sequence focuses on the character Becky and her plight during the 1980s (as with the rest of the characters). In the first cut of the film, it is meant to follow after Jack is in his office cutting a Johnny Doe video and occur before Amber attempts to arrange the custody of her son.</p>
<p>In the sequence, Becky is being physically abused by her new husband after he becomes increasingly disapproving of her past career in porn. The scene begins with Reed excitedly telling Dirk that Johnny Doe (the younger up-and-comer that Jack hires) has recently died in a car crash. Becky, who is beaten up and frantic while hiding in a locked room, calls for help from Dirk, who is high on cocaine. They arrange to meet. Becky's husband eventually breaks through the door and punches Becky. When he turns his back to walk away, Becky strikes him repeatedly with a frying pan before running out of the house.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dirk, who is still sniffing coke while driving to meet Becky, crashes his Corvette into a telephone pole. Upset at ruining his car, Dirk turns around and drives back home; throwing a fit and forgetting about Becky entirely while she waits for him at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Like most of the stories in the film, Anderson was inspired by many similar real-life occurrences. "It turns sour, it turns into this really violent relationship -- which I've heard about a million times in porno where it's the guy meets the girl who's in porno. And he's real turned on and 'wow, baby, that's so fucking hot' and 'my girlfriend's a porno actress' but then two weeks later it's: 'you're a fucking whore, how could you do that?' and he's beating her, you know. And that's a story you hear pretty often, over and over again."</p>
<p>Anderson gives many reasons why this sequence was cut on the DVD commentary for the film: "We had a lot of porno and we had a lot of violence already in the movie and I don't know how much more we needed... We cut it from the movie and I'm glad we did, but it sure is fun to watch it." In addition, while seeing the movie many times over, Anderson would always be excited for the courtroom scene with Amber. Eventually, he determined that this was because the Becky sequence was getting in the way of the more prominent characters.</p>
<p>In the end, Anderson decided that Becky would leave the story with a happy ending rather than another tumbling fate that follows with the rest of the characters in the 1980s.</p>

<li>The opening scene is nearly three minutes long without a cut, and shows most of the characters in the film, ending with a shot of young Eddie Adams (the future Dirk Diggler). At the end of the movie, there is a similar long scene without a cut showing most of the characters, right before the last scene with Dirk in his dressing room. Another long, single take sequence that fleshes out many characters takes place during the first party upon Eddie's arrival to porn as the future Dirk Diggler.

<li>During the first screening of the film in front of a test audience, people cheered when Little Bill got his gun from his car after seeing his wife cheating on him again with someone in bed. P.T.

However, as soon as Little Bill shot himself in front of camera, the entire audience went dead silent with shock. This pleased Anderson to no end.
