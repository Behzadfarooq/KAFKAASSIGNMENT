	    <p>I am part of this generation, and I think the explination is incorrect. Most of the people who move back with their parents move back because of either money, or the fact that that they were not sufficiently prepaired to live on their own. The fact is that it is much harded to get started in the 00s than it was in previous decades.</p>

<dd>This is a very strange entry. People born during these particular five years consists of a generation due to one single trait? Anyway, I live in Sweden, but I agree that it seems harder to establish your own life now than it has been before. I only speak from my experience in Stockholm, but living/rent is expensive, jobs and apartments are hard to get by, and the competition is tough. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 20:59, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term is in general use because of the rough boundaries of this generation and the observation of unusual numbers of recent college graduates returning home. It does seem the term is unfortunate. Perhaps another term related to scarcity in times of wealth or some other common feature might work? Alternatives could stick if presented here. Just some thoughts from a former "twentysomething" back in the day. --<a href="../../../m/0/l/User%7EM0llusk_26b6.html" title="User:M0llusk">M0llusk</a> 00:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How can people born in 1986 be considered part of this generation? They're only freshmen and sophomores in college, so by definition, they can't be boomerangers...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most people born in 1986 would be starting their 3rd year in a 4-year college now, or would have just graduated with an associate degree from a 2-year college. I think they are included because of the latter possibility. Also, I think there is a consensus between the attitudes of a great chunk (at least) of people born in 1986 and the (apparent) 'defining' attribute of this generation regarding living with one's parents after being on your own for a few years. I, along with most of my friends were born in 1986, and there is generally lacking any stigma that was once associated in American culture with living at home after you graduate. There tends to be a feeling that returning home after school (or never leaving in the first place) is financially, as well as emotionally a good idea. So, I think perhaps a few more years will be added yet to the boundaries of this generation, as more people graduate and fit into this generation's 'definition' (also, the span of this generation is pretty small).--D izzygirl 22:43, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree and think that perhaps it could be extended to a lot of today's college students who will return home after college or stay at home during college. It seems that this is happening a lot. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShijeru_7253.html" title="User:Shijeru">shijeru</a> 22:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;shehn&gt; I was born in '80, graduated from undergrad in '02, and we were already headlong into the recession (minor depression?) that began probably in early '01. My suggestion would be to move these years slightly back, so that the entry reads '1978-1984', at least for now. But even though the middle class contributes to shrink as a demographic percentile of all American households, it's hard to argue that we're still in a recession. So - depending on how we are defining 'Boomerang Generation', it could either be crisply and permanently terminated around '84, or it could continue indefinitely until the Baby Boomers cease to comprise the bulk of the middle class - which could be another 10-20 years with progressively later retirement ages and continued public health improvements. &lt;/shehn&gt;</p>
<p>Please don't add <i>citation needed</i> markers where they're not needed. There's plenty of evidence to support the claims made in this article -- and a plethora of citations have now been provided to back up these claims. Three different <i>citation needed</i> markers in a single sentence seems a bit execessive. Sometimes I get the feeling people add <i>citation needed</i> markers just to cast doubt upon statements they believe are detrimental to favored political powers. We're here to write an encyclopedia -- not help one political party look better than another. The fact that there have been periodic economic downturns affecting some generations should not be questioned just because it might make somebody's given politics look bad. Plenty of evidence backs up the statements made in this article. Some negative economic factors affected the Boomerang Generation. If you have something to add, please feel free to add it (and cite your sources). That's much more helpful and constructive than just casting doubts on two or three statements per sentence in an effort to make the whole article appear biased and suspect. Thanks! 66.17.118.207 14:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just wanted to add that the boomerangers are called 'Generation Internship' (Generation Praktikum) in Germany and `Generation in danger' (génération précaire) in France. So it seems to be an international phenomenon. (Joerg Tremmel)</p>
<p>I think the article overemphasizes the impact of "outsourcing." All the references given for this statement are from the media, and studies referenced in the linked articles (if they reference hard data at all) cite numbers like 45k to 400k jobs lost to outsourcing in a 3 month period. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports gross private-sector job losses and gains to be on the order of 6 to 9 million per quarter between '96 and '06. 6% or so of job losses loosely attributable to outsourcing is hardly a staggering statistic.
