<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Does it make it notable because they boast about their sexy body? What kind of opinionated gratuitous argument is that? Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia not a music magazine. Wikipedians have discussed this before and the general consensus was against adding individual songs to Wikipedia. That consensus unfortunately seems to have been stretched. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 23:31, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Commonly men sing about women's bodies and use that to objectify them and treat them as inferior. Conversely in this song, women are using their physical attributes to assert dominance and superiority. My opinion is that that makes it notable. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:25, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But because Destiny's Child sing about it that makes it okay to objectify women as sex objects when women know you dont need to show tits and arse on a music video to be accepted. Dominance and superiority ... let me guess you're a man right? Btw Bootylicious is co-written by a man, Rob Fusari. Nope I'm not convinced this song is anyway notable. I just think this entry is an excuse to justify sexploitation song under the subterfuge of notability and it aint notable at that. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 03:24, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the "okayness" is relevant, so I'll drop that if you don't mind. Thank you for clarifying your thinking on notability. My impression is the opposite, that a song that is far more notable than many other songs with articles is being VfD'ed because it is regarded as offensive sexploitation. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:46, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)~
<ul>
<li>Well there's the rub.. There are *many* songs that *dont* deserve their own articles, however trying to tell those few one-eyed fans that and its considered by them to be blasphemous. Because it just happens to be "Bootylicious" doesnt mean that it's been singled out. If the song is not notable it shouldnt be on wikipedia altogether period. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:58, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>So add a little bit about the song to the album page, then. There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't have a separate article on a popular song.

<li>I've confirmed it with a developer on IRC. The IP address matches with one of the removal of non-notable songs, and a message left on a previous vfd page that was considered no longer live. Moce 04:38, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here's what I asked the developer to look at:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_by_name:_C&amp;diff=8734644&amp;oldid=8734634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_by_name:_C&amp;diff=8734644&amp;oldid=8734634" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_by_name:_D&amp;diff=8764032&amp;oldid=8734472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_songs_by_name:_D&amp;diff=8764032&amp;oldid=8734472" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the developer came up with these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gareth_Owen&amp;diff=8770329&amp;oldid=8702774" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gareth_Owen&amp;diff=8770329&amp;oldid=8702774" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/List_of_songs_by_name&amp;diff=8702658&amp;oldid=6687137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/List_of_songs_by_name&amp;diff=8702658&amp;oldid=6687137" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Of course, you can run it through a developer again if you think there was bias in the testing.

<li>The IP address is a publicly accessable one from a publicly accessable library lab. Anybody can log onto that IP address and edit. Since it is not a private address anybody can contribute from that address besides myself, so your excersise proves nothing.

<ul>
<li>Well, we just had a great time over in IRC over this. I asked the IRC denizens and the response was that we only have your word on whether or not that computer terminal is public or not. Given the numerous similarities in rhetoric, topic interest, viewpoint, and time with the other user matched by the IP address by the developer, the admin can use their judgment whether or not to count your vote. Anyways, if I had voted for this, my vote would have been <b>delete</b> on the grounds of non-notability. So to the admin who tallies the votes, discount my vote. Moce 08:30, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it's proven Moce is Kappa I would request to the admins that all votes by Moce and Kappa be declared null and void as its comments have done nothing but attack a genuine user such as myself. It is a common tactic on Votes for Deletion to accuse a person of being a sockpuppet. The fact that some is cowardly enough to hide behind a sockpuppet to attack me is pretty low thing to do. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 00:22, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. People please use your heads when you decide crap like this should be kept or merged. All the delete votes are correct. I've had to deal with it before, so I warn you not to repeat the mistakes of the past. I mean, come on, I actually had to go to a therapist to understand the insane results of <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_867-5309_Jenny_8401.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/867-5309/Jenny">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/867-5309/Jenny</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_La_La_785b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/La La">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/La La</a>.

<p>Oh, and one last thing before I leave. I won't be around to see the conclusion of the debate since I'm flying out to spend the holidays with my family on my vacation. I apologize for bringing this whole issue into the public, I should have just kept within IRC, but it was just too good to resist. In hindsight, I should have just waited for the result of the debate because I seem to have diverted the debate from the merits of the article. I should have learned by now not to butt in other people's debates unless I actually contribute to it. So, I'm sorry to Megan1967 if you're really a genuine user, only in your heart you would know. I'm sorry to Kappa for getting in the middle of your debate and any stress this has caused. I'm sorry to everyone who was irritated about my butting in and happy holidays. Also, to all those voting keep, you all really need to have some standard when deciding to keep non-notable songs such as this one, the fanboys/fangirls are having a great time filling Wikipedia with songs from their favorite bands &amp; artists. So, go back to talking about the article if you want I'd like to see the end result of the vfd when I come back from my holiday vacation in the new year. Once again, happy holidays.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm still exhausted from my last strenuous vfd experience, so I'll just say the song is notable. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Tiger_a99b.html" title="User:Angel Tiger">Angel Tiger</a> 21:49, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've never heard of this song. It has never been mentioned by any music authority as being notable. I did a google search and only came up with results that used the "bootylicious" as a word describing Destiny's Child and not talking about the actual song itself. If I were an admin, I'd delete this garbage to hell and beyond. Bonsai K 21:57, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comments/question: I give up on notability, it's way over my level for inclusion, and it seems to be way below other people's so no-one's mind is going to change. For people voting delete, I'd like to ask what if anything you would say about this song in the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destiny%27s_Child_6bfa.html" title="Destiny's Child">Destiny's Child</a> article. As regards fanboys pushing their favorite bands, that could be avoided drawing a line using some objective criteria like sales or chart positions... BL sold an awful lot of copies. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:33, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

Certainly the energy spent on this vote could have been spent into turning the article into something more significant that might cause those of us who see it as non-notable to reconsider.&lt;/<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a>&gt;

<li>I'm sorry it's badly written. Regarding incompleteness, as I mentioned I'm hoping that someone more expert than me comes along. I think it's better than the original entry, which I was happy to try to cleanup because it seemed like a notable single in an under-represented genre. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:20, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>&lt;<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 07:16, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)&gt;It's not so much that it's badly written, but that it hasn't really been written yet. This seems like a clear case where the song's significance should be clear and articulatable in a few years if it has had a lasting effect, at which point the article can be recreated by someone prepared to actually write the article. Banking on that effect now isn't very encyclopedic, and I discourage use of the wikipedia to promote things whose significance has not yet come to pass. If, however, someone were to write an article on the significance that the song has already had (which is by no means clear to me at this point), I would be happy to reconsider my position.&lt;/<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a>&gt;</li>

<p>151.203.196.127 21:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)What is wrong with you people? Wikipedia is supposed to be a collection of all human knowledge. If people know stuff about the song "Bootylicious," there should be an article about it in which that information is contained. Where's the harm in having articles about all sorts of things? Geesh <i>end moved discussion</i></p>
