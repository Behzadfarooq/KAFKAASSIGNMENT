<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_Group_15ab.html" title="Edit section: About Boots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">About Boots</span></h2>
<p>Boots was founded in Nottingham, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Boot_7e69.html" title="John Boot">John Boot</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a> and transformed into a national chain by his son <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Boot_be8e.html" title="Jesse Boot">Jesse</a>. Its current logo is based on a design made by one of Jesse's signwriters in the <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a>. The chain was established during that time, and for the first time they became official dispensing chemist, stocking prescription medicines. By the onset of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> there were over five hundred Boots shops. In 1920, Jesse Boot sold the company to an American called Louis Liggett who owned a company called Dug Incorporated. However, deteriorating economic circumstances in North America saw Boots sold back into British hands in 1933 with the son of the founder, John Boot who inherited the title Lord Trent from his father, at the head of the company ('Interwar retail internationalization: Boots under American ownership', <i>International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research</i>, 7(2), 1997). In 1968 it acquired the 622- strong Timothy Whites and Taylors Ltd chain. Boots now has almost one thousand five hundred stores including some stores overseas. The Alliance Boots group in total has nearly 3,000 stores.</p>
<p>The company, consists of several subsidiary companies, such as <b>Boots The Chemists</b> Limited, which is the main retail chain. The parent company is now called <i>Alliance Boots <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_limited_company.html" title="Public limited company">plc</a></i>. The other main trading companies are Boots Opticians, and Boots Retail International. Originally with their own logos, all parts of the original Boots Company group now share the oval Boots logo. Alliance Boots plc has a separate logo, however. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> the company opened a new manufacturing plant in <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cramlington.html" title="Cramlington">Cramlington</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>.</p>
<p>Since the appointment of a new <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Executive_Officer_c57b.html" title="Chief Executive Officer">Chief Executive</a> from <a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a>, the company has been given a refocus, inevitably leading to more outsourcing (such as Boots's own warehouses at its Head Office base in Nottingham - now owned by <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unipart.html" title="Unipart">Unipart</a>) and job losses at Nottingham. In a break from tradition, Boots is reported to be preparing to lease out a main office building (vacant due to the level of staff losses) on its own private estate in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeston%2C_Nottinghamshire_cf52.html" title="Beeston, Nottinghamshire">Beeston, Nottinghamshire</a>.</p>
<p>Boots from 1989 to 2001 owned <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halfords.html" title="Halfords">Halfords</a> and once owned FADS, a home furnishings store and <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_%28DIY%29_Ltd_d78e.html" title="Focus (DIY) Ltd">Do-It-All</a>, a joint venture with <a href="../../../w/_/h/W_H_Smith_c9b8.html" title="W H Smith">W H Smith</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childrens_world.html" title="Childrens world">Childrens world</a> â€” similar to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mothercare.html" title="Mothercare">Mothercare</a> â€” was another Boots company. They also considered moving into selling <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_toy.html" title="Sex toy">sex toys</a> but in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> announced that they had decided not to. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4190693.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4190693.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_Group_15ab.html" title="Edit section: Merger with Alliance UniChem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merger with Alliance UniChem</span></h2>
<p>On the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_October_0136.html" title="1st October">October 1</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, rumours began to spread that Boots and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_UniChem_59dd.html" title="Alliance UniChem">Alliance UniChem</a> were planning to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger.html" title="Merger">merge</a>, although there had been no official announcement.</p>
<p>This was formally announced on the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_October_198f.html" title="3rd October">October 3</a> by the Chairman of the Boots Group, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Nigel_Rudd_9190.html" title="Sir Nigel Rudd">Sir Nigel Rudd</a>. He said of the deal, "I believe that this merger does an awful lot for customers, for shareholders, and for indeed the employees".</p>
<p>The merger would create a chain of pharmacies with 17% of the UK market. Alliance UniChem's UK retail pharmacies are mainly "community pharmacies" located in small retail precincts in residential areas, whereas Boots shops are mostly on the main high streets of towns, cities and suburbs and in major shopping centres. The merger will also give Boots the major international presence which it has struggled to develop on its own.</p>
<p>The declining state of the retail industry in the UK has led to the merger and will help the company to face the competition given to it by supermarkets such as <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a> that have entered the pharmaceutical market.</p>
<p>On Monday, 3rd October 2005, the merger was confirmed, and the new group took on the name Alliance Boots. After the merger it became Britain's dominant pharmaceutical retailer and wholesaler.</p>
<p>On 7 February 2006, the Office of Fair Trading decided not to refer the proposed acquisition by Boots Group PLC of Alliance UniChem Plc to the Competition Commission. This was due to the fact Boots agreed to sell 96 shops in local areas where there was a substantial lessening of competition. Boots will now operate 2,500 Chemist Stores across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The merger became effective on Monday 31 July, 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_Group_15ab.html" title="Edit section: Expansion and diversification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion and diversification</span></h2>
<p>In the 1990s Boots branched into <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dentistry.html" title="Dentistry">dentistry</a>, with a number of stores offering this service. Boots has also made a venture into "Wellbeing" services offering customers treatments ranging from <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial.html" title="Facial">facials</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, and <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrition.html" title="Nutrition">nutritional</a> advice to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_eye_surgery.html" title="Laser eye surgery">laser eye surgery</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botox.html" title="Botox">Botox</a> (although the Botox service was short-lived). These ventures proved to be unprofitable. Boots Hearingcare was sold, and now trades as "David Ormerod Hearing Centres at Boots". In late 2004 Boots also sold off the Dentistry, Footcare, and Lasix eye surgery services to <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_Express_cdf7.html" title="Optical Express">Optical Express</a> who, like the Hearingcare.</p>
<p>Boots also attempted to move into the music business adding departments into many of their stores that sold recorded music, however they were unable to tempt the public away from the already established competition in this field, such as <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths_Group_plc_52ec.html" title="Woolworths Group plc">Woolworths</a> and <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Price_b89d.html" title="Our Price">Our Price</a>.</p>

<p>Boots has also diversified into the research and manufacturing of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medication.html" title="Medication">drugs</a>. It developed <a href="../../../i/b/u/Ibuprofen.html" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>, a <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analgesic.html" title="Analgesic">painkiller</a> and continues producing, trading and exporting its finished form (tablets, syrup etc.) in the UK and internationally, although manufacturing the bulk drug is now the activity of major pharmachemical operations in the USA, India and China.</p>
<p>Boots has <a href="http://bootsus.bri-global.com/main.asp?pid=3597&amp;rnd=9061" class="external text" title="http://bootsus.bri-global.com/main.asp?pid=3597&amp;rnd=9061" rel="nofollow">expanded</a> into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> by supplying its popular ranges such as Botanics and No7 to retailers such as <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Corporation_8dc1.html" title="Target Corporation">Target Stores</a>, <a href="../../../c/v/s/CVS_Corporation_ccff.html" title="CVS Corporation">CVS</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoppers_Drug_Mart_8d4c.html" title="Shoppers Drug Mart">Shoppers Drug Mart</a>.</p>
<p>Boots stores also started to sell products not traditionally associated with Boots such as <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dyson_f3bf.html" title="James Dyson">Dyson cleaners</a> - under the name 'Offer of the Week'. These 'odd' items were bought in bulk and savings on <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Street_b8b6.html" title="High Street">High Street</a> prices are passed onto the customer. Although to many this seemed odd, Jesse's own customers were often presented with 'odd' items which Jesse purchased by buying in bulk and taking the first steps towards the strength of bulk buying. Jesse once filled the windows of his second Goosegate shop with sponges. Boots desisted with this strategy as it became evident it was unprofitable. In place of 'Offer of the Week' stores now frequently give out "money-off vouchers" to be used in store.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_Group_15ab.html" title="Edit section: Advantage Card">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advantage Card</span></h2>
<p>The Advantage Card is the loyalty card of The Boots Company. It is billed as "the UK's most rewarding" loyalty card as it offers four points per pound spent. Each point is worth Â£0.01. Points can be exchanged for products, but only as whole payment, for example a card with 384 points on could buy a Â£3.79 product, but not a Â£3.99 product, even if the difference was offered in cash.</p>
<p>In the Republic of Ireland, the card offers 1c for every Euro spent; UK cards cannot be used in the Republic, nor vice versa.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> (see <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katz_Group_of_Companies_bde4.html#Pharma_Plus" title="Katz Group of Companies">Pharma Plus</a>) and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> were all closed in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.

<p>These financial results are of Boots Group PLC as a stand- alone company, before the Alliance UniChem Plc merger and the change of name to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_Boots_9f7d.html" title="Alliance Boots">Alliance Boots</a> plc.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_Group_15ab.html" title="Edit section: The Boots Estate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Boots Estate</span></h2>
<p>The Boots Estate features a range of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_buildings.html" title="Listed buildings">listed buildings</a>, notably D6 and D10 which are both Grade I, and D31, D36, and D90 which are Grade II. Staff enjoy a staff <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a>, coffee and snack shops, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsagent.html" title="Newsagent">newsagent</a>, a branch of Boots The Chemist, and bank situated within beautifully landscaped grounds.</p>
<p>The landscaped grounds include the Millennium Garden which features a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_garden.html" title="Herb garden">herb garden</a> (with some plants that Jesse used in his original herbal remedies) in the shape of a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose.html" title="Goose">goose</a> foot - harking back to Jesse's original shop on Goosegate in Nottingham.</p>
<p>The Boots Museum is now closed (due to cost cutting) and historical items are in storage.</p>
<p>The Head Offices are adorned with some interesting artefacts from old stores and feature two 'shops' where new displays and advertising are trialled. Over the summer months staff work hard to create <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> displays in the second of the two shops hidden from view with only certain staff permitted access. The plans for Christmas - a major trading time for any retailer - start to take shape in September and late Summer as stores gradually move shelving and displays <a href="http://www.boots.com" class="external text" title="http://www.boots.com" rel="nofollow">boots official website</a> ready for the massive increase in products and stock. Stores are therefore in a state of flux for almost half the year, although the Company makes great efforts to keep disruption to a minimum to its customers and is very much focused on customer navigation of its stores.</p>
<p>The Head Office site also features its own trial suite where new products are sampled and tested by consumers before the final decision is made to launch a product. However Boots also develops and produces a range of products for major names.</p>
<p>Since the merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem, it has become unclear about the future role of the Boots Estate within the combined Alliance Boots.</p>
<p>The Alliance Boots Head Office is situated in London (on the same premises as the old Alliance UniChem Head Office), meaning some buildings on the Boots Estate will now become redundant.</p>
<p>The Alliance Boots Wholesale division is being run from the Alliance UniChem site in Weybridge, Surrey, whilst the Community Chemists operation is being run from the Alliance UniChem site in Feltham, Middlesex.</p>
<p>This means that the only substantial divisions of Alliance Boots which is being run from the Boots Estate in Nottingham is that of Health and Beauty (operators of the larger Boots stores, which sell a larger range of products in addition to the core medicine range, and Boots Manufacturing (responsible for producing in house toiletries and medicinal products).</p>

<p>In October 2005 Boots agreed to sell its over-the-counter medicines business, Boots Healthcare International, which markets brands such as <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clearasil.html" title="Clearasil">Clearasil</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurofen.html" title="Nurofen">Nurofen</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optrex.html" title="Optrex">Optrex</a>, <a href="../../../e/4/5/E45.html" title="E45">E45</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strepsils.html" title="Strepsils">Strepsils</a>, to the Anglo-Dutch household products company <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reckitt_Benckiser_e83f.html" title="Reckitt Benckiser">Reckitt Benckiser</a> for Â£1.936 billion.</p>
<p>Boots used Â£1.43 billion of the sale proceeds to make a one-off special dividend payment, which roughly equalised its market capitalisation with that of Alliance UniChem prior to the merger between the two groups. The remainder will be retained for investment about tonico.</p>
<p>The disposal was completed on 31 January 2006.</p>
