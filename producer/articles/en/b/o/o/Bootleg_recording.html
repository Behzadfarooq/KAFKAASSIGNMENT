<p>A <b>bootleg recording</b> (or simply <b>bootleg</b> or <b>boot</b>) is an <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_recording.html" title="Sound recording">audio</a> and/or <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video</a> recording of a performance that was not officially released by the artist, or under other legal authority. A great many such recordings are simply copied and traded among <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html" title="Fan (aficionado)">fans</a> of the artist without financial exchange, but some bootleggers are able to sell these rarities for profit, sometimes by adding professional-quality sound engineering and packaging to the raw material.</p>
<p>Bootlegs can consist of recordings of live performances, or material created in private or professional recording sessions. Changing technologies have had a great impact on the recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry.</p>
<p>Although distinct from <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a> ("piracy") and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterfeit.html" title="Counterfeit">counterfeiting</a>, as it involves material which has never been offered for commercial release, bootlegging is clearly illicit. The <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrights</a> for the song and the right to authorize recordings reside with the artist, according to several international <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_treaty_table.html" title="Copyright treaty table">copyright treaties</a>, and the fine print on concert tickets (which generally prohibit recording) is subject to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a> law. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide "authorized" alternatives to satisfy the demand.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Edit section: Definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definitions</span></h2>
<p>Some artists consider any release for which they do not receive <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royalties.html" title="Royalties">royalties</a> to be equivalent to a bootleg, even if it is an officially licensed release. This is often the case with artists whose recordings have either become <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> or whose original agreements did not include <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reissue.html" title="Reissue">reissue</a> royalties (which was a common occurrence before the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>).</p>
<p>Many bootlegs consist of private or professional studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a>, works-in-progress or discarded material. These might be made from private recordings not meant to be widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_studio.html" title="Recording studio">recording studio</a> or the offices of a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record label</a>. A number of bootlegs originated with <a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_broadcasting_35a4.html" title="FM broadcasting">FM radio</a> broadcasts of live or previously-recorded live performances.</p>
<p>However, the most common type is the <b>live bootleg</b>, or <b>audience recording</b>, which is created with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_recording.html" title="Sound recording">sound recording</a> equipment smuggled into a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">live concert</a>. Many artists and most live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging increasingly easy, and as this technology has improved so too has the general quality of these recordings.</p>
<p>The alternate term <b>ROIO</b> or <b>RoIO</b>, an <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> meaning "<b>R</b>ecord <b>o</b>f <b>I</b>ndeterminate <b>O</b>rigin", or "<b>R</b>ecord <b>o</b>f <b>I</b>llegitimate <b>O</b>rigin", arose among <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> collectors trying to clarify the differences between counterfeits, pirate copies, live bootlegs, and "ROIOs", meaning recordings whose legal status was difficult or even impossible to determine. The term has spread beyond Pink Floyd fans but its recognition and usage depends largely on the individual community. It is also sometimes used to denote a Pink Floyd recording of any kind.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, "bootleg" became an alternate term for "<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashup_%28music%29.html" title="Mashup (music)">mashups</a>" or "bastard pop", a style of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remix.html" title="Remix">remix</a> in which two or more musical recordings are melded into new piece of music. Early examples often copied sound clips without paying royalties to the original artist.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Edit section: The early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The early years</span></h3>
<p>Unauthorized recordings can be traced back to the early days of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> music. The first recognised rock bootleg in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> was a double-LP known as <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_White_Wonder_7f89.html" title="Great White Wonder">The Great White Wonder</a></i>, for the plain white cover, sleeve and labels. This was a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> collection of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> recordings and studio out-takes, as well as seven tracks from sessions made with members of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a> (released many years later in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Basement_Tapes_247f.html" title="The Basement Tapes">The Basement Tapes</a></i>), put out by a pair known as "Ken" and "Dub". The album was in great demand since these unreleased tracks were otherwise unavailable. Hundreds of other bootleg LP's of Dylan's music, including several volumes of <i>Little White Wonder</i> would be released over the ensuing years. One notable release was <i>Ten of Swords</i>, a 10-LP box set that was issued shortly after the 5-LP <i><a href="../../../b/i/o/Biograph.html" title="Biograph">Biograph</a></i> was released in 1985. Unlike most major artists, whose bootlegs were usually recorded in large concert venues, the Dylan bootlegs were typically taken from unreleased songs, demo tapes, or live performances made in intimate settings or during interviews. Due to the wealth of material of this type, Bob Dylan is probably the most widely bootlegged artist ever.</p>
<p>Other early bootleg recordings that date from the same time period as <i>The Great White Wonder</i> include <i>Kum Back / The World's Greatest</i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <i>The Greatest Group on Earth</i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>. Soon thereafter, bootleg recordings began to emerge from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> as well, with an unofficial release of a live recording of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Albert_Hall_a74f.html" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>.<sup id="_ref-Galloway_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galloway" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another famous bootleg is <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Wilson_47c4.html" title="Brian Wilson">Brian Wilson</a>'s famous unfinished masterpiece for the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach_Boys_b7bd.html" title="Beach Boys">Beach Boys</a>, <i><a href="../../../s/m/i/Smile_%28Beach_Boys_album%29_3f2b.html" title="Smile (Beach Boys album)">SMiLE</a></i>. When the project was scrapped in Spring 1967, sleeves for the album had already been printed by <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, listing about a dozen songs supposed to be on the album followed by the disclaimer "See label for correct running order," as Wilson was never able to assemble a running order. Many different bootleg versions of the album have surfaced over the years, each one with its own guess at a correct running order based on the material available, yet generally retaining the "Smile Shop" cover art from the Capitol-printed sleeves. (Brian Wilson himself answered this question with his <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smile_%28Brian_Wilson_album%29_4ff3.html" title="Smile (Brian Wilson album)">2004 recording/realization</a> of the abandoned <i>SMiLE</i> project, but bootlegs of the original sessions continue to circulate among fans.) Many bona-fide <i>SMiLE</i> sessions recordings surfaced on late-60's Beach Boys albums ("Our Prayer" and "Cabinessence" on <i><a href="../../../2/0/2F/20_20_9c54.html" title="20/20">20/20</a></i>), and the band also re-recorded some <i>SMiLE</i> songs, including the album's supposed centerpiece, "<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surf%27s_Up_12a5.html" title="Surf's Up">Surf's Up</a>." The first recording to be released from the sessions was the 1967 single "<a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_and_Villains_bd94.html" title="Heroes and Villains">Heroes and Villains</a>," which also ended up on the album released in <i>SMiLE's</i> place, <i><a href="../../../s/m/i/Smiley_Smile_8f5c.html" title="Smiley Smile">Smiley Smile</a></i>. Several other songs from the sessions were re-worked and re-recorded for <i>Smiley Smile</i>.</p>
<p>Early live recordings typically contained a great deal of crowd noise, with screams and whistles from audience members close to the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microphone.html" title="Microphone">microphone</a> sometimes drowning out the performance. Bootleggers gradually found ways to minimize this, sometimes just by choosing their position in the crowd carefully, by elevating the microphone above the crowd on an extensible pole, or by taping it to a light or speaker pole. Others found ways to connect recording equipment directly into the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_of_House_0993.html" title="Front of House">Front of House</a> <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixing_console.html" title="Mixing console">mixing console</a> or soundboard, with or without the cooperation of the performer's sound crew.</p>
<p>Blank album covers and labels were commonplace in the early years of bootlegging; the album was often identified only by a xeroxed page inside the shrink wrap listing the artist and songs, sometimes with a photograph or two. Some albums would have phony labels or covers that listed songs and artists that were in no way related to the actual music on the album. In an attempt to legitimize the practice, many LP's purported to have been made in Italy, West Germany, Australia and other countries so that they could be marketed as "imports" rather than bootlegs. After having many of their albums available in bootleg <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> decided to put their newest album (<a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_at_Leeds_afd7.html" title="Live at Leeds">Live at Leeds</a>) in a brown, cardboard looking cover with "The Who Live at Leeds" stamped on the cover to make it appear as though it were a bootleg. The songs were written written on the album (by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Townshend_41b5.html" title="Pete Townshend">Townshend's</a> hand) to further the joke.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> the bootleg industry in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium_rock.html" title="Stadium rock">stadium</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_rock.html" title="Arena rock">arena rock</a>. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as <a href="../../../k/o/r/Kornyfone.html" title="Kornyfone">Kornyfone</a> and Trade Mark of Quality.<sup id="_ref-Backtrax_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Backtrax" title="">[2]</a></sup> The large followings of bands such as <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">vinyl</a>, as it became evident that more and more fans were willing to purchase them. In addition, the huge crowds which turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of recording equipment virtually impossible.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> there were a number of record mastering and pressing plants that were not "first in line" to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These pressing plants were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality. Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1972 Pink Floyd bootleg called <i>Brain Damage</i> was released under the name <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Screaming_Abdabs_3794.html" title="The Screaming Abdabs">The Screaming Abdabs</a>.<sup id="_ref-Backtrax_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Backtrax" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bootleg collectors in this era generally relied on <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Wacks_57d9.html" title="Hot Wacks">Hot Wacks</a></i>, an annual underground magazine catalog of known bootlegs, for information about recently-released bootleg albums. It provided the true information on releases with fictitious labels, and included details on artists and track listings, as well as the source and sound quality of the various recordings.</p>
<p>The market outlets for bootlegs-for-sale were varied. In the early years, bootlegs could be bought from vendors lurking in the alleys and parking lots around live venues, as well as at <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swap_meet.html" title="Swap meet">swap meets</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flea_market.html" title="Flea market">street markets</a>, record collector shows, and smaller record stores. <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_order.html" title="Mail order">Mail order</a> sources were advertised by word of mouth, and in many cases uniquely associated with individual bands. There were major markets in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> for <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_bootleg_recordings_7bc8.html" title="Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings">Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pink_Floyd_ROIO%27s_f492.html" title="List of Pink Floyd ROIO's">Pink Floyd ROIOs</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_bootlegs_6389.html" title="The Beatles bootlegs">The Beatles bootlegs</a>, and rarities from The Rolling Stones, <a href="../../../k/i/s/KISS_%28band%29_69cc.html" title="KISS (band)">KISS</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photocopying.html" title="Photocopying">photocopies</a>. However, later in the decade a number of unofficial "labels" such as Swinging Pig emerged in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, which released limited editions of better quality recordings, with improved album artwork. This trend in enhanced audio and packaging standards continued into the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.<sup id="_ref-Galloway_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galloway" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> saw the increased use of <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_cassette.html" title="Audio cassette">audio cassettes</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotapes</a> for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubbing_%28transferring%29.html" title="Dubbing (transferring)">dubbing</a> equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette_culture.html" title="Cassette culture">Cassette culture</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tape_trading.html" title="Tape trading">tape trading</a>, propelled by the <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_ethic_b8ba.html" title="DIY ethic">DIY ethic</a> of the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk subculture</a>, relied on an <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_system.html" title="Honor system">honor system</a> where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community.</p>
<p>For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glastonbury_Festival_90b4.html" title="Glastonbury Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, by the end of the 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.<sup id="_ref-Galloway_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galloway" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Probably the most celebrated bootleg recording is <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Album_%28Prince%29_e03b.html" title="The Black Album (Prince)">The Black Album</a></i> by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">Prince</a>. The album was to have been a conventional major-label release but was pulled back from the market almost immediately after its initial release in November 1987. Bootlegs appeared shortly thereafter from a variety of sources and with widely different sound qualities. Reportedly, over 500,000 copies were sold.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> there was a widespread conversion of many of the older bootlegs onto the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a> format. Unofficial recordings became more readily available than ever before, resulting in thousands of bootlegs being circulated on CD amongst avid collectors and fans, in many cases of shows which were recorded over thirty years previously. In particular, companies in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> exploited the more relaxed <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> laws in those countries by pressing large numbers of CDs and including catalogs of other titles on the inlays, making it easier for fans to find and order shows direct.<sup id="_ref-Galloway_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galloway" title="">[1]</a></sup> Similarly, relaxed copyright laws in Australia meant that the most serious legal challenge to unauthorized releases were made on the grounds of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a> law by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Music_Entertainment_ba48.html" title="Sony Music Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. Court findings were in favor of allowing the release of unauthorized recordings clearly marked as "unauthorised." However, the updated <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade_3d48.html" title="General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade">GATT 1994</a> soon closed this so-called "protection gap" in all three aforementioned countries effective <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>.<sup id="_ref-Heylin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heylin" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Filling in the vacuum, with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> expanding, bootleg websites and mailing lists began to appear, including public websites catering to collectors who exchanged tapes and CDs free of charge, and surreptitious ones devoted to the sale of bootlegs for profit.</p>
<p>The tightening of laws and increased enforcement by police on behalf of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Phonographic_Industry_4a61.html" title="British Phonographic Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI), <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_ae97.html" title="Recording Industry Association of America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a>—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground.<sup id="_ref-Galloway_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Galloway" title="">[1]</a></sup> Physical bootlegging largely shifted to less regulated countries such as <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>, and other specialized websites.</p>
<p>However, the late 1990s and early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a> saw an increase in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of standard <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_file_format.html" title="Audio file format">audio file formats</a> such as <a href="../../../m/p/3/MP3_27bc.html" title="MP3">MP3</a>, combined with the ability to share files between computers via <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_Transfer_Protocol_5436.html" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messaging.html" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>, and specialized <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-to-peer.html" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> networks such as <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napster.html" title="Napster">Napster</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/BitTorrent_9cbd.html" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, made it simpler than ever for bootleg collectors to exchange rarities. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format for the first time, tracks from bootleg CDs were <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripping.html" title="Ripping">ripped</a> to computer hard disks, and new material was created with <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_recording.html" title="Digital recording">digital recording</a> of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. One notable change caused by this shift in technology was the unit of exchange: instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, aficionados often now had the option of searching for and <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downloading.html" title="Downloading">downloading</a> bootlegs of individual songs.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">ISO 8601</a> yyyy-mm-dd (year-month-day) date format is frequently used to label digital files containing bootleg concert recordings, as this format makes it simple to sort bootleg files chronologically.</p>

<p>Bootlegging is often incorrectly referred to as <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">piracy</a> but there are important differences between the two terms. Bootlegging is trafficking in recordings that the record companies have not commercially released, whereas piracy is the illegal copying/sale of recordings that are (or have been) available commercially or are planned/scheduled for commercial release. Historically, pirate releases were widespread in the <a href="../../../8/-/t/8-track_cartridge.html" title="8-track cartridge">8-track cartridge</a> format, many with labels spuriously claiming that "all royalties have been paid."</p>
<p>A pirate release is further distinguished from a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterfeit.html" title="Counterfeit">counterfeit</a>. Counterfeits attempt to mimic the look of officially released product; pirate releases do not necessarily do so, possibly substituting cover art or creating new compilations of a group's released songs. A counterfeit is always a pirate but a pirate is not necessarily a counterfeit.</p>
<p>"Bootlegging" is sometimes also used to refer to the unlicensed <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighted</a> music but the term piracy is usually more appropriate. In the same vein, "bootlegging" has become the default term amongst anime fans to describe the piracy or counterfeiting of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Disc_08eb.html" title="Compact Disc">CDs</a>, <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVDs</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games.html" title="Computer and video games">computer and video games</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade_game.html" title="Arcade game">arcade games</a>, and other Japanese merchandise. These increasingly sophisticated imitation goods from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> are much reviled by fans and the industry alike, and many anime <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_convention.html" title="Fan convention">fan conventions</a> have adopted a strict non-bootleg policy for vendors and attendees.</p>

<p>Most artists have made little effort to pursue legal action about bootleg recordings, viewing such "rarities trading" as harmless provided that it is not being done for profit. The benefits of interfering with such trading are fairly minimal compared to the potential ill-will generated against the artist, as the illicit works are generally circulated among the artist's most loyal fans, which have the most interest. Most record companies also have not shown an interest in pursuing or prosecuting small-scale bootleggers, but this could change at any time.</p>
<p>However, in 2004 U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. struck down a 1994 law banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[7]</a></sup> He dismissed a federal indictment of Jean Martignon, who was running a Manhattan mail-order and Internet business that sells bootleg recordings. The Recording Industry Association of America disagreed with the ruling, saying the decision "stands in marked contrast to existing law and prior decisions that have determined that Congress was well within its constitutional authority to adopt legislation that prevented trafficking in copies of unauthorized recordings of live performances", according to spokesman Jonathan Lamy.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>An increasing number of artists have decided to allow and encourage live audience recording, although they and their fans generally consider the <i>selling</i> of such recordings—as opposed to keeping them for one's own personal enjoyment or trading them for other audience recordings—to be illegitimate bootlegging. Fans cite the encouragement of these recordings as a key factor in their long-term loyalty to these bands.</p>
<p>In addition, many performers have made joking suggestions to bootleggers presumedly in the audience, especially when a new or unusual song is about to be performed. Fans often cite such comments hopefully as evidence of permission to make bootleg recordings.</p>
