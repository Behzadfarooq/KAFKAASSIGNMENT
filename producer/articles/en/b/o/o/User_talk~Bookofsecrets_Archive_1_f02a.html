<p>It bothers my mind on how you guys misunderstand me. I started out here rough as I have no diplomacy in my blood. I was learning the ropes. Then all the harassment started. Then it went from bad to worse. Then I decided enough was enough. So I started my seige. I was simply forced into the defensive mode. I could have improved and been an asset to the project, but that isn't what any of you wanted. So I turned from Dr. Jekyll to to Mr. Hyde in rapid order.

<dd>Welcome back bumpusmills. You have a lot to learn so lets get started. Would you like the opportunity to attend REAL Ah-ni-yv-wi-ya Ceremonies and really learn our culture? Also, we are not called "Cherokee". This is a European word. If so, post an email address where I can get hold of you and I will put you in touch with the leaders of the Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni and you can attend ceremonies and participate in our culture. Welcome home brother. Waya sahoni 06:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Waya sahoni. I am touched and honored that you have welcomed me as your brother. It makes my spirit soar like the eagle. My email address is <a href="mailto:mythicweb@earthlink.net" class="external text" title="mailto:mythicweb@earthlink.net" rel="nofollow">mythicweb</a>. I was not raised in our traditions and ways. I know only two or three words in our language. This is no fault of my own, but it is something I feel needs attending too. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 07:11, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You will learn a lot more words. The email link you posted is busted, BTW. send an email to <a href="mailto:tjarcher@comcast.net" class="external text" title="mailto:tjarcher@comcast.net" rel="nofollow">tjarcher</a>. I will get it this way. Waya sahoni 08:20, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bumpus, I need some help with grammar and cleanup on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Joe_Byrd_9705.html" title="Chief Joe Byrd">Chief Joe Byrd</a> article. How about showing me how you practice <a href="../../../g/a/d/Gadugi.html" title="Gadugi">Gadugi</a> and helping me out (without fighting). I have a lot of stuff on this dirtbag to post yet, but you can cleanup the language, if you want to. Joe Byrd is a disgrace and is deserving of being immortalized on Wikipedia. I also suspect after he learns of this article he will be here all the time vandalizing it. Add it to your watch list and assist me in keeping it reverted. Interested? This is one character we want to recognize for his contributions to our people. Waya sahoni 06:52, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I know nothing of this Chief Joe Byrd. Until this I've never heard of him, ever. I'd like to assist if I can. I just don't know how since I have no idea who this man is and all. Oh, and I have no more plans for fighting. I'm sorry that I'm such a brawler. If you'd please assist me in keeping negative people from harassing me, and some of it I literally had coming, but some I found very unnecessary.

<dd>Waya sahoni here is a list of the spirit animals I've known about who work with me. Bear, Buffalo, Elk, Snake, Wolf, Dog, Eagle, and Hawk. They have been teachers and protectors. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 14:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what you were doing at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_chr_5bd3.html" title="Template:User chr">Template:User chr</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_chr-1_942d.html" title="Template:User chr-1">Template:User chr-1</a> when you removed the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[[Category:User chr|{{PAGENAME}}]][[Category:User chr-1|{{PAGENAME}}]]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, it looks a little dense and much like nonsense to many new editors. However, it exists to automatically add users to a category for Cherokee speakers. For example, when you place {{User chr}} or {{User chr-1}} on your user page, that that extra code will automatically add you to the corresponding category or categories. You'll subsequently see, at the bottom of your user page, something that looks like "User chr-1" or "User chr;" you'll now be listed in that category. The alternative would be having to manually add the category, which is both a pain and is unstandardized with other language userboxes as well. For future reference, it's best not to erase Wiki tags just because they don't do anything to alter something's immediate physical appearance.

<p>They had ÊˆÊˆÊˆ instead of chr or chr-1. I was merely trying to get them right without the ÊˆÊˆÊˆ on there. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 20:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rebelguys2. I believe I have things straightened out. Wa-do for telling me about it. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 20:55, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're also having some issues implementing your ethnic background categories. Categories in Wikipedia are automatic; that is, if you insert "[[Category:Celtic Wikipedians]]" into your user page, you will <i>automatically</i> be placed onto that page. There's no need to manually place your name there. The category list will not be editable, because there's no need. When you hit the edit box at the top of the Category pages, anything you enter should just be a small header or introduction. If you'd like User:Waya sahoni to be in the category, ask him to place the necessary tag onto his user page. This automation is what makes categories easy and, therefore, is why it's so useful! I've gone ahead and blanked those pages, as it's already, automatically, there.</p>
<p>In addition, remember that categories are hierarchical. As a result, the other reason to edit category pages is to place them under another, more general category. I've gone ahead and placed <a href="../../../c/e/l/Category%7ECeltic_Wikipedians_6475.html" title="Category:Celtic Wikipedians">Category:Celtic Wikipedians</a> and Category:American Indian Wikipedians under Category:Wikipedians by ethnicity.</p>
<p>The ethnicity categories don't seem very clean and clear-cut to me, but that's because it doesn't really matter. We're here to write an encyclopedia, after all; not our own biographies.</p>
<p>One last note; I saw that you updated the code for your userboxes. However, it's much easier to just place the template onto your page automatically. Say you wanted the template at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_chr-1_942d.html" title="Template:User chr-1">Template:User chr-1</a> (Cherokee level 1) on your page. Just place {{User chr-1}} on your page to have it automatically appear, with the category and everything. This syntax works for any template. That way, if the template is updated, your page will automatically update as well. Either way, it's must cleaner looking when you're editing your page. Take a look at the bottom of my user page for an example. â€” <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 22:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rebelguys2. Wa-do for your instructions. I've always done things the hard way it seems. lol But I'll catch on in the end. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 13:09, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
