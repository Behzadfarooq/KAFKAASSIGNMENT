<p>Many apologies, I am a novice, a complete novice, in everything.</p>
<p>I read that the book of Isaiah foretold the destruction of Babylon by King Cyrus and the coming of Jesus, written in 732 B.C.E.</p>
<p>I need to ask if the Dead Sea scroll was genuinely carbon dated and if the complete book or which small fragments of Isaiah were found in the Dead Sea scrolls.</p>

<p>I added a cleanup tag to this article. The two main reasons I found for doing so are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intro section, which should be 1-3 paragraphs, is more than a full page in most browsers, reducing the utility and convenience of the table of contents.</li>
<li>The entire "Use in the New Testament" section is edited in a form that is rendered poorly by the wiki engine. It should either be wiki-formatted as suggested by the edited text, or be restructured to look good in plain wiki formatting.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect there are other aspects of this article that could use some attention as well. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 21:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>, (or others) I removed the Cleanup tag after reviewing the article. It appears that all your requested items had been removed. I would add though that the 1st introduction paragraph contains info on authorship that then later in the article is debated. Perhaps that one little thing could be dealt with in the Single Authorship sectionl, but doesn't require the Cleanup tags. <a href="../../../l/s/j/User%7ELsjzl_df2e.html" title="User:Lsjzl">Lsjzl</a> 21:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Talk%7EBook_of_Isaiah_8ea9.html" title="Edit section: Single Authorship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Single Authorship</span></h2>
<p>There are two paragraphs championing single authorship for Isiaah. They are awkwardly interspersed with what appear to be the original article. They do not cite any sources and refer to 'many scholars' without mentioning any.</p>
<p>FWIW the theory of multiple authorship is not in any serious dispute among critical scholarship. Fundamentalist students of the Bible object to the idea of multiple authorship but adhere to critical methods to support their position. In fact they do not believe in applying the tools of critical scholarship to the Bible which they hold to be innerant, therefore above critical study.</p>
<p>In response to the above, it is true that the vast majority of scholars hold to multiple authorship, and in fact, there are indications, e.g., Cyrus' name, talk of rebuilding the temple in C 64, which seem to indicate that the original author could not have written the entire book in his own lifetime. However, there are some scholars who would argue for the entire book being "essentially" the work of a single author, perhaps edited and somewhat expanded by his followers, but that no large part of the book was in fact the product of a separate author and appended to the original. Far more scholars today, however, are focused on a unity of the book of Isaiah, but not necessarily a unity in the sense of being the product of a single author in the timeframe of Isaiah the son of Amoz, but rather an intentionally crafted work of literature which may have used disparate sources, but nonetheless has a single provenance, design, and message.</p>

<p>But why should the accurate mention of future events and Cyrus' name automatically mean that Isaiah did not write those parts? If Isaiah was indeed a real prophet why should such accuracy rule out his authorship? For example: if in the future lions actually start eating straw like an ox etc etc, does that mean those parts couldn't have been written in the past?</p>
<p>Say if one accepts that Isaiah was a prophet, are there any inconsistencies in the "Book of Isaiah" text that would preclude single authorship? Or is there other evidence? If there aren't any then it also seems a stretch to claim that just because the book of Isaiah contains accurate prophecies those prophecies couldn't have been written by the alleged prophet.</p>
<p>Funny that accurate prophecy should automatically disqualify books allegedly written by prophets from being accepted as being written by those very prophets!</p>
<p>IMO it would make more sense that the lack of accurate and clear (rather than vague) predictions would automatically disqualify "prophetic books" from being treated seriously&#160;;).</p>

<p>The statement of accurate prophecy is interesting, as prophets in the OT cannon are mostly forthtellers of what is happening to Israel, or what will happen soon in general terms, not a specific name.</p>
<p>I am not trying to put into doubt Yahweh's prophets, but very rarely does that kind of prophetic work occur in the Bible at all.</p>

<p>I added those tags because this article is highly disputed from a Jewish POV. It contains mistranslations from the Hebrew. etc. <a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms2_e271.html" title="User:Ems2">ems</a> 06:46, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From your addition of identical tags on the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon_the_Righteous_46dd.html" title="Simeon the Righteous">Simeon the Righteous</a>, it would seem that your objection focuses on Isaiah 7:14. As the comments on the discussion page for Simeon indicated, it is the Septuagint that made the translation with the word parthenos. But more importantly, the txt on this page indicates already that there is some dispute. Perhaps you'd feel less frustrated(?) with Wiki if you actually attempted to rephrase the text you object to rather than just leave these tags in place. <a href="../../../j/g/f/User%7EJGF_Wilks_8755.html" title="User:JGF Wilks">JGF Wilks</a> 16:08, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
