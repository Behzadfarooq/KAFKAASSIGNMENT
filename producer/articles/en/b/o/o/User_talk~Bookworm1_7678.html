<p>Please stop changing this template to read "as of 2005". It is used on a large number of MLB player articles, most of which have not had their stats updated through the 2005 season. Changing it on the template changes it on each article it is used in. I will work on a solution that will alleviate this problem, but until then, please leave it as-is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 23:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I've changed the template to use an additional parameter, <tt>statyear</tt>. This should eliminate any need for changing the template directly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 01:13, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:A dempster 275.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bookworm1_8cf9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bookworm1">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Mlb todd helton.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

<p>Yes, I'm still a member of Wikipedia. I've just been extremely busy lately and I haven't been able to get on to Wikipedia and make some serious contributions.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you were interested in my Baseball 1876 WikiProject, and I was wondering if you could help me get it started again, because it got deleted and you seemed to be the only person interested.</p>

Ever since I first posted on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Baseball_14a2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball">WikiProject Baseball</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Baseball_5696.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Baseball">talk page</a> about my idea for the season team articles for Baseball teams a couple days ago, I have been waiting anxiously for somebody to join. However, I really wasn't expecting it to happen today. Thank you for deciding to contribute. If there is anybody you think would like to contribute as well, feel free to ask them. I would like to get all 30 teams started when the season starts because, and I know this from my experience doing the hockey articles, it is a <b>pain in the butt</b> to try to catch up. Thank you again for deciding to join.

<dd>Who says <b>you</b> have to upload a picture of this guy? The ballpark will be full of thousands of people that may do it. We don't want images owned by the MLB, we want free images. Replaceable doesn't mean you have to or the image must already exist, it just means that it's possible. As long as he's a MLB player, that is certainly the case. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 01:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
