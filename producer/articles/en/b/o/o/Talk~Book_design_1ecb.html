<p>NO. Don't merge it. The term bladspiegel came to have more implications... the idea of the 'reflection-book or 'book of reflections' developed moral meaning; as the book made in 'reverse' it seemed to develop occult implications - still with us today in the idea of the 'mirror books'... and there is now a whole body of literature on the poetic and other associations for the idea of the mirror - including that of technical and scientific precision - which come into effect. For most people who don't realise the connection to the arts of printing, it would never occur to them to look up "Book design" but they do look up the terms we find at the time... Bladspiegel.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft.html" title="Craft">Craft</a>, or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">Art</a>, of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design.html" title="Design">designing</a> a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">Book</a>, although related, is clearly distinct from that of the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Element.html" title="Element">elements</a> which make up a book. The former is <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptive.html" title="Prescriptive">prescriptive</a>, while the latter is <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descriptive.html" title="Descriptive">descriptive</a>. For example, a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliophile.html" title="Bibliophile">bibliophile</a> may not at all want, or need, to know HOW a book is made, but it would be strange for a lover of books not to know its elements. One the other hand, in designing a book, one would want to know <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to.html" title="How to">how to</a> use the appropriate <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrument.html" title="Instrument">instruments</a>.</p>
<p>The User who suggests merging gives no reason other than <a href="../../../s/i/m/Similarity.html" title="Similarity">similarity</a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I strongly protest merging --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 18:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore, this article itself is quite new (August 2006). It was commenced by user <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">User:Dicklyon</a> himself, and it is he who suggests merging. --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 19:03, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think similarity (more than that, complete overlap) is all the reason needed for a merge. You do know merging means we keep all the information in both articles, right? Add together the best of both to make a single higher quality article... And the person who is familiar with the content would be the best candidate to recognize that the content is overlapping! In summary, I'm not sure why you're objecting to the merge. —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 21:13, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I oppose merging because I have serious concern with the term, "design." It is highly missleading. In the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing.html" title="Publishing">publishing</a> industry, I know there are <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text.html" title="Text">text</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editors.html" title="Editors">editors</a> and book desingers. However, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookman.html" title="Bookman">bookmen</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_collector.html" title="Book collector">book collectors</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliophile.html" title="Bibliophile">bibliophiles</a> like myself have only a secondary concern with the beautiful craft of DESIGNING the book. As such, we want to know what the ELEMENTS of the book ARE! <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 22:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, notice that my reference is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style_fd3b.html" title="The Chicago Manual of Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>, while you omit all omit this reference, you have exactly THREE references--each of which have the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept.html" title="Concept">concept</a> of DESIGN in the very title of the reference work.</dd>
<dd>Thus, the appropriate remedy to our conflict should be DIVERSIFICATION. We should make our articles as DIFFERENT from each other as possible. I recommend that you guys write more about the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_Crafts_5c45.html" title="Arts and Crafts">Arts and Crafts</a> of DESIGNING a book--that the title of your article!!!<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 22:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The book design article was started over a year ago by Jossi, actually. As long as both articles are so short, and the overlap strong, I see no compelling reason to have both. If the material when fleshed out becomes rather long, or has several incompatible subjects, then a split would be OK; but not now. Of course, the addition of more good material and references will be welcome. It also makes sense to start some division into sections, with a a major section for the elements of book design. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 02:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think perhaps the 'page design' topic is given too much emphasis here, it should just be a subsection of this article; that, and the prominent image are possibly giving you a false impression?</dd>
<dd>At a glance, you've replicated most of the information from here, at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_elements.html" title="Book elements">Book elements</a>. That's a valid alternative title; I'd suggest "Book structure" (to match <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html#Structure_of_books" title="Book">Book#Structure of books</a>) as a good possible title too. A merge from <i>here to there</i> would almost make more sense now; except that - part of the reason a merge from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_elements.html" title="Book elements">book elements</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_design.html" title="Book design">book design</a> would be beneficial, is to keep the history of the original article intact and in a single location. (because we don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> our contributions, as such).</dd>
<dd>After the information is all in one location, and 'page design' is in a proper subsection, we can decide what title to use (whether to move it from here to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_elements.html" title="Book elements">book elements</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_structure.html" title="Book structure">book structure</a>), and add more illustrations.</dd>

<pre>
  The basic unit in book design is the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_spread.html" title="Page spread">page spread</a>. The left page (called <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Verso.html" title="Verso">verso</a></i>)

  and are centered on the <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutter.html" title="Gutter">gutter</a> where they are bound together at the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookbinding.html" title="Bookbinding">spine</a>.
</pre>
<p>The <b>page spread</b> means NOTHING in regard to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_elements.html" title="Book elements">Book elements</a>.

<p>Ludvikus: I'm still not completely sure what you're doing with the page currently titled <s>Book structure</s><a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_parts.html" title="Book parts">Book parts</a>. It seems to be trying to summarize many different things in one place, and it has too many problems for me to try to fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like chunks of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html#Types_of_books" title="Book">Book#Types of books</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html#Book_structure" title="Book">Book#Book structure</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookbinding.html" title="Bookbinding">Bookbinding</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_design.html" title="Book design">Book design</a> were copied into a single place, and then added to a bit.</li>
<li>The section <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_structure.html#Outline" title="Book structure">Book structure#Outline</a> begins with three links to the same place,</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_structure.html#See_also" title="Book structure">Book structure#See also</a> is mostly duplicates of links already within the article.</li>
<li>There are many words linked that shouldn't be, such as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Part.html" title="Part">part</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a>. (Check out the intro and 1st section at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Internal_links" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Internal links</a> for discussion of overlinking)</li>
<li>There are many one sentence long paragraphs.</li>
<li>Also, that last page move created many double-redirects (since fixed by an admin. but now <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Book_parts_d770.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Book parts">they're all self-linking</a> back to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_parts.html" title="Book parts">Book parts</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm coming from the position that we want to create good, long-ish articles, like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">Book</a>, with <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Summary style</a> when the sections get long enough. I'm personally very strongly against needless repetition (hence my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergism" class="extiw" title="m:mergism">mergist</a> stance in general). To that end, I still believe <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_parts.html" title="Book parts">Book parts</a> (and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endpapers.html" title="Endpapers">Endpapers</a>) should be merged into this, or other relevant articles.</p>
<p>If I'm correct that you're attempting to build what is essentially a short summary of many articles, I'd suggest that this is frowned upon here as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Content forking</a>, but it would be immensely useful over at <a href="../../../../simple/b/o/o/Book.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Book">simple:Book</a>? —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 19:56, January 15, 2007</p>
<p>Sorry for all the negativity above! But I felt the need to elaborate on the specific problems I see, before this becomes a long debate. —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 03:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>. The parts of a book are clearly part of the process of book design. The <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_parts.html" title="Book parts">Book parts</a> article is in any case little more than a long (overlong?) list of links to other articles. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. "Book design" is the art, or craft, of making a book. On the other hand, according to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a>, a stand work in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, a book has a certain <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style.html" title="Style">style</a>, called "Book parts", and these are very precisely described in said manual. This does not involve the book's manufacture, though these are clearly related. The idea involved here is to list completely all the possible parts of a book, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, as one sequentially turns the pages from the front to the back. This is not Original Research, as this information is actually set forth in pages 3 through 35 of said reference. --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 04:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>. The only opposition seems to have been from the creator of the other page. Ludvikus, so you still object in the face of the apparent consensus to merge it here? <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 03:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Merge result</b>: There's a clear consensus to merge, so I've done it.
