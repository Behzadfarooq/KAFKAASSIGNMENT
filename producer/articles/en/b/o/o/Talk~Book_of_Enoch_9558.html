<p>I'm unsure how editing on wiki works, however I need to make a correction. In the article, I quote, "Whilst this book does not form part of the Canon of Scripture for the larger Christian Churches, various groups, <b>including the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Coptic Church of Alexandria</b>, regard parts or all of 1 Enoch to be inspired Scripture." This statement is 100% <b>false</b><i>Italic text</i>. The "book of Enoch" is not part of the deutrocanonical books under the beliefs of the Apostolic churches - Eastern/Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic. --MikhaelAdly 21:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's 100% <b>true</b>. It's not part of the deuterocanonical books for any other Churches, but it most definitely is for the Coptic and Ethiopian Churches, as the article states. I have an Ethiopian Bible right here with Mets'hafe Henok (Book of Enoch) included right at the beginning of the deuterocanon. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 22:44, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I don't know how the Coptic Church sees Enoch, and I don't know what editor added that they include it. But the Book of Enoch is most definitely in my Ethiopian Bible with the Deuterocanon, and it is most definitely considered canonical in Ethiopia. That's my source. You can find it in any copy of the Ethiopian Bible that includes the Deuterocanon.

<dd>Hi. Having spoken with a friend about the Ethiopians, yes they are going through some internal problems, but I will do the research. In terms of us, Coptic Orthodox, we do not accept the "Book of Enoch", it is still pseudo.. How can I go about editing the article? Thanks--MikhaelAdly 14:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the same way you edited this talk page. But I think you still have somewhat more to learn about our standards; which you can read here <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>. Conversations you had with your friend "about the Ethiopians" are basically useless for our purposes. Ethiopians may or may not be "going through internal problems" politically, but that is irrelevant to the position of the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church_1c2e.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> which is unambiguous on its canon, and has issued several definitive statements that they consider Enoch to be canonical, and part of the Bible. Haile Selassie, whom you may have heard of, even stated this and made sure it was translated into modern Amharic from the ancient Ge'ez version, and that is the same version still appearing in Amharic Ethiopian Orthodox Bibles today. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:55, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There should be a mention of Dr. John Dee and Enochian Magick/Language mentioned here, The Book of Enoch was integral to his system. Perhaps I will add a link at least ... for now. <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 05:47, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The text of the Book of Enoch was considered lost until the beginning of the 17th century, when it was confidently asserted that the book was found in an Ethiopic translation in <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abyssinia.html" title="Abyssinia">Abyssinia</a>...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not clear on this. Was Enoch not part of the Ethiopian Orthodox canon until that discovery, or was it just unknown outside of Ethiopia? It seems hard to believe it would be considered "lost" if it was in a church's canon.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cuchullain</a> 05:41, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It was almost entirely unknown outside of Ethiopia. For Jews, Enoch was one of the books cut from the Bible by the Sanhedrin at Yavne ca. 85 AD, and for those Christians covered by the Roman Empire, the very same list of books was cut by the council of Roman Bishops in AD 365, mainly because they could no longer be found in the Hebrew Bible. This is somewhat ironic, because the original reason they were cut from the Hebrew Bible in 85 AD, is because those were the books being used more by Christians than by Pharisees. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> 15:53, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is interesting that the book of Enoch mentions Mt. Sinai, which didn't exist in the time of Enoch as he was an antedeluvian. If you believe in the great flood as described in the book of Genesis, one would be hard pressed to believe that the launching place of the ark of Noah was anywhere near the modern Mt. Sinai and that the geological features persisted from pre-flood earth</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Intresting question its the translated version that calls it Mt. Sinai I would imagine the Ethiopian has another name which we now know based on descriptions or old maps as Mt. Sinai? Also isn't a antedeluvian a grandchild of Caine? just no mention of this on his page so wondered where you heard that? --Shimirel 20:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Something I found just now which you all might find intresting... "...The ONLY...geographical landmarks in 'Original Enoch' refer to Galilee! In I En.6, the 'angels, the children of heaven...descended into Ardos, which is the summit of Hermon.' "In 13.7, Enoch has been sent to deliver imprecations against the fallen angels and offer their prayers for forgiveness. 'And I went and sat down upon the waters of Dan - in Dan which is on the southwest of Hermon - and I read their memorial prayers until I fell asleep.' (Peter's Confession in Mk.8.27-30 is delivered in the environs of Caesarea Philippi, on the southwest approach to Hermon.) "In 13.8-9 Enoch's story continues, 'I came unto them while they were conferring together in Leya'el, which is between Lebanon and Sanzer...' Though 'Sanzer' is uncertain, apparently 'Leya'el' represented the Valley of Jezreel in Galilee." - Philip B. Lewis (CrossTalk) --Shimirel 22:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually some mountains did indeed exist before the Flood: "17And the flood was upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and the water abounded greatly and bore up the ark, and it was lifted on high from off the earth. 18And the water prevailed and abounded exceedingly upon the earth, and the ark was borne upon the water. 19And the water prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and <i><b>covered all the high mountains which were under heaven</b></i>. 20Fifteen cubits upwards was the water raised, <i><b>and it covered all the high mountains</b></i>. 21And there died all flesh that moved upon the earth, of flying creatures and cattle, and of wild beasts, and every reptile moving upon the earth, and every man. 22And all things which have the breath of life, and whatever was on the dry land, died. 23And God blotted out every offspring which was upon the face of the earth, both man and beast, and reptiles, and birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth, and Noah was left alone, and those with him in the ark. 24And the water was raised over the earth an hundred and fifty days." - Genesis 7:17-24 LXX -- 66.144.34.5</dd>

<p>Someone wrote in the code: "Since Bruce's discovery, an Old Church Slavonic translation has been identified" is this different from, or the same as, "2 Enoch"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No its not Enoch 2 (different contents) its a number of copies of Enoch 1 in a couple of different languages I believe. In fact its this discovery that reinforces the belief that the book of parables is a later addition as it appears they may have been in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_language.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic</a> I believe. --Shimirel 20:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi everyone the page is getting a bit on the long side '35 kilobytes long' at the present edition. I was wondering what you thought about splitting the books onto seperate pages allowing for additional expansion on the summary of each book part as and when people desired. So the content section would disappear, with the layout section linking out to each individual book. Like the way it does it with the Book of Giants with each page linking back to here from each page. Or another way might be to leave the content section with the layout of each book with a link going out for further details? What do you think? -- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimirel_0763.html" title="User:Shimirel">Shimirel</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimirel_847c.html" title="User talk:Shimirel">Talk</a>)</sup> 23:10, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My reasons for reverting your work: (ELohim) Really what the list would come across as is say 'perfection' + 'god' so you would say "perfection of God" or "perfection is God". Another example is Michael "he who is like God" or "likened unto God" the name hasn't changed just the interpretation of it. "No scholar in existence has suggested that el means 'in God', which doesn't make any sense since a name like Gabriel means "strong man of God", not "strong man of in God"." Actually you might take it to mean "strong man in god" aside from your comment being perhaps pov or rude it does not belong in an article thats what discuss is for. If you think its wrong take it out and give reasons here that back it up. Though I will change it to just God so someone can take whatever meaning they like. You changed Giants back to Nephilim ('again' and in directly quoted text), Nephilim is the name used in Genesis NOT from the book of Enoch, all translations that I've seen say giants. I was already adding a link to make this clearer before I ended up here. The reason for using 'it' to describe parts of the book rather than saying 'Enoch' is because its <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphal.html" title="Pseudepigraphal">pseudepigraphal</a>! I use Azâzêl, Semjâzâ, and Sêmîazâz et al because the translators would never write the translated versions as Azazel for instance. You shouldn't just mess around with the quotes of text if you have a later version (than is listed in notes) add the details in the notes section and then ill leave them in place by all means. "The original Hebrew would have" &lt;sigh&gt; see my history for the article edits not to mention reading it before editing it. Gods Kettle/Crucible/Cauldron you see all those names in different places so until someone can say which is 100% correct ill leave it like this. I've left your change to the dream visions alone for the simple reason you could be right&#160;:) I'm not confident enough at the moment to disagree with your interpretation. That said I do think the messiah is in fact "and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head" which does go along with Jesus so you may have misinterpreted. -- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimirel_0763.html" title="User:Shimirel">Shimirel</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimirel_847c.html" title="User talk:Shimirel">Talk</a>)</sup> 17:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To "Codex Sinaiticus"&#160;:</p>
<p>A couple of citations, as requested, for major authorities stating the 5-part macrostructure of 1Enoch (with lesser additional chunks):</p>
<p>Vanderkam, JC. 1Enoch:A new translation (Minneapolis:Fortress,2004), p1ff (ie. preface summary)</p>
<p>Nickelsburg, GW. Hermeneia:1Enoch1 (Minneapolis:Fortress,2004), p7-8</p>
<p>I expect Charlesworth (1985?) also mentions this in his summaries within his OT Pseudepigrapha series, but my copy is on loan till Monday. RH Charles recognized litterary units - he does refer to it but again I dont have the material to hand to cite. And indeed this theory was first posited as far back as the mid c19 by some German scholar whose name I forget! And just glance down the page of the current article ... does not the consensus opinion of different dates for the different sections suggest to you distinct compositions?!</p>
<p>I can only imagine you have some personal academic/religious agenda in requesting citations over this point (of all the 'dubious' uncited assertions in the article!); it is fairly apparent to even the the non-expert familiar with the material (and isn't influenced by religious concerns) that we are likely dealing with several separate compositions that themselves have highly complex redactional histories. (Naturally any outline beyond the most superficial lies in the realms of academic journals, not wiki!)</p>
<p>I have changed the wording back from "some" to "most modern scholarship" (instead of my previous "most scholars").</p>
<p>172.215.181.32 22:53, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is pov pushing, you have not demonstrated that "most" "scholars" think Enoch was originally 5 different works, only that "some" do. This is a recent view, and furthermore it is incorrect because Enoch was NOT composed of five separate works. It might be added that this view is unsupported speculation, no matter how many modern "scholars" adopt this line. People have been trying to trample Enoch in the dirt for thousands of years, beginning with the Pharisee council of Yavneh which replaced it with the Talmud, now in the age of internet it is no longer feasible to blot ot out of existence, will you stop at nothing to smear it??? It remains a holy book in Ethiopia no magtter what lies you tell.

<p>Given that the Ethiopic version was just about all that was available until c19, the view of it being a composite work (1850s) is actually surprisingly old. This issue is not even discussed any more in academic circles, but taken as a given. It might be a holy book in Etheopia, but the fact remains that most modern scholars (or rather, any that are respected in academic, as opposed to religious, circles) it is a composite work. You need to learn the difference between opinion and fact. It is a FACT (absolutely indisputable, in that they can be numbered) that most modern scholars hold the OPINION that it is a composite work. And that opinion is, in their eyes at least, far from unsupported (otherwise peer review would criticise it as such). You are right that this issue is 'pov pushing', but it is you who is doing it. Just because you hold an opinion doesnt make it the majority opinion. You are abusing wiki, using it to unduly emphasise your miniority religious opinion, despite citation. So I have reverted to my version once again. By all means include (non-OR, and thus preferably cited) information over the opposing view, but leave the FACT that most modern scholars (be they right or wrong) affirm a composite nature. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.141.236.166.html" title="User:172.141.236.166">172.141.236.166</a> 14:23, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I quote this gem&#160;: "beginning with the Pharisee council of Yavneh which replaced it with the Talmud". You may wish to read the wiki article on the Talmudim. This council was unrelated, being a faw centuries too early for any involvement! <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.141.236.166.html" title="User:172.141.236.166">172.141.236.166</a> 14:40, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can only claim "most" scholars hold that opinion, if with typical arrogance, you pretend that Ethiopian scholars do not count.

<dd>Apparently there isn't any actual EVIDENCE that might actually CONVINCE someone that it was once five separate works, beyond the bald assertion of a bunch of western scholars who are trying to foist that view, and make peoples' minds up for them, who are supposed to be just taking their word for it...

A "bald assertion" by a bunch of Western scholars? Be it a "bald assertion" or not, they are not tied to a fundamentalist religious dogma that requires them to state otherwise. Any early Ethiopean study would not have had access to more recent mss dicoveries, and in any case could not acknowledge them as significant as they hold as dogma that their version is the original. Their view is worth stating in the article, but it MUST be stated as now being a minority view.</p>
<p>And I'm now registered here, despite seldom using (let alone editing) wiki. I shall again make the changes to the article in this same location. I have provided citations when requested, and could provide (litterally) hunderds more as required. I shall change 'most' to 'much', not because 'most' is wrong, but because it will leave you with no excuse to foist your <i>"at least an equal number of scholars, and probably many more, who maintain the integrity of..."</i> falsity upon other readers who may know no better. Wiki is not a soapbox from which you can maintain your minority religious dogma to the suppression or marginalization of majority opinions. I shall ask for an administrator to intervene under the 3RVR rule if you seek to impose your POV on the article again.

<p>My apologies - didn't occur to me you would be using Unicode characters in sig - looked like an odd attempt at anonymity&#160;:) All displaying properly for me now .... typical edit conflict too *sigh*. And far from anti-religious I can assure you. However I quote some wise words of Kant&#160;: "Religion without science is empty, science without religion is vain"&#160;:) Synthesis of religious 'revelaed truths' with observed 'facts' has been a problem for philosophers since the Mu'tazilites, and arguably (in a less systematic way) since the Greeks. Neither camp has all the answers. Because of that, both sides need a hearing, which is why both your view, and the view of modern scholars (which i happen to share, from a position of some acquaintance with the text) need to be listed in the article. Your view remains the view of religious scholarship, and mine of academic scholarship. Without coming to a blanket value judgment of their individual conclusions, it will be recognized by most that research in the modern world is governed by post-enlightenment ideals - namely on the basis of evidence! Where there is a refusal to move with the times, it necesarily devalues any opinions formed under such conditions. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobermory_d938.html" title="User:Tobermory">Tobermory</a> 17:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine, but it's really not quite that simple as to say my view is the view of "religious scholarship"... It depends what religion you are talking about... Most of the "scholars" who first said it was not canonical were after all religious... And many secular scholars like Wossene say it was all one document... But you are entitled to your point of view, although I've still never seen anything at all really convincing in the text of a Maccabean date, and it takes a little better argument than "because we don't have to say what the Church says"... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:37, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An individual may be religious, but that doesn't mean that their academic output will reflect their religious beliefs. Equally, someone who 'lacks religion' may not be free of its influence. Academic scholarship tries hard to disown external interest (although it can never be totally successful in doing this) to attain the 'truth'. Religious scholarship has a religious motive (personal or otherwise), and the 'truth' of an opinion is often judged according to its correspondence with accepted tradition (religion is inherently conservative). It is that which separates the religious scholar from the academic scholar. A scholar who doesnt have to agree with the Church is not necessarilly correct in his opinions, but one that does have to agree with the Church is more likely to be wrong because he has less freedom of thought and cannot respond to new evidence (unless you presuppose the default accuracy of church tradition, that is! Lets not go there ...). <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobermory_d938.html" title="User:Tobermory">Tobermory</a> 18:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this comment really necessary?</p>
<p><b>Female heifer is Eve (notice she becomes a cow)</b></p>
<p>If Adam is a bull, and Cain a calf, and Abel a calf, does it not follow logically that Eve is a heifer? What exactly am I supposed to notice about Eve as "she becomes a cow"? I'm curious. I can only presume that whoever made this comment is insinuating that it is an insult. Try stepping out of your prejudices and 21st century mind and how you may perceive that a cow is a derogatory term for a woman. Here on Wikipedia itself it states that a heifer is a term of endearment, but an insult when referring to a woman who is fat.</p>
<p>This is POV and should be deleted.</p>
<p>Good thing it doesn't say Adam is a dog or this person would probably start their own conspiracy website.</p>

<p>Codex Sinaiticus keeps reverting a change which it seems to me is completely reasonable:</p>
<p>Old text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> at <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavneh.html" title="Yavneh">Yavneh</a> c. <a href="../../../9/0/_/90_AD_3bf7.html" title="90 AD">90 AD</a> removed this book from its Scriptures. Partly due to this, the book was discredited after the local Christian <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Laodicea_7884.html" title="Council of Laodicea">Council of Laodicea</a> in <a href="../../../3/6/4/364.html" title="364">364</a>, which quite a few scholars regard as being a nonexistent council, interestingly enough. The Greek text was subsequently lost as well as the Hebrew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New text (by Rocksong):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the fourth century it was mostly excluded from Christian lists of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> (the Ethiopian Orthodox Church being an exception). The Greek text was subsequently lost. The Jewish <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> at <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavneh.html" title="Yavneh">Yavneh</a> c. <a href="../../../9/0/_/90_AD_3bf7.html" title="90 AD">90 AD</a> removed this book from its Scriptures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the improvements are obvious.</p>
<p>1. I remove the reference to a single list of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Laodicea_7884.html" title="Council of Laodicea">Council of Laodicea</a>, and replace it with a link to the fuller article <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> which discusses all the different lists. The old article gives the impression Laodicea was the key moment in Enoch being denied canonicity, but I know no evidence for this and the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> article suggests it wasn't. 2. I remove a link between the Yavneh (90 AD) and Laodicea (364 AD) which is made without any citation. 3. I remove the unencyclopedia comment "interestingly enough". 4. I remove the mention on the Hebrew text because this section is about the Christian church which used the Greek. The existence of a Hebrew version is disputed, and discssed elsewhere in the article anyway.</p>
<p>Codex Sinaiticus accuses me of "suppression", which is strange because I link to <i>more</i> infomation at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a>. s/he also doesn't like the change of order - well I don't care which way the order goes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't do edit wars. Can someone else offer an opinion on my edit, and restore it if they think it is reasonable. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 12:54, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(I'm italian, sorry for my english). If this can help you, Book of Enoch is not in jewish biblical canon because is not write in hebrew: all non-hebrew books at Yavneh were declared apocriphal. About christian biblical canon, is apocriphal because it is not in Septuaginta: only this books were inclused in christian bible.</dd>
<dd>I've write the italian article <a href="../../../../it/l/i/b/Libro_di_Enoch_16ac.html" class="extiw" title="it:Libro_di_Enoch">it:Libro di Enoch</a>, and imho is better (full, easy, orderly) than english article. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertoreggi_4328.html" title="User:Robertoreggi">Robertoreggi</a> 22:42, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question then, of course, is how was it decided which books belong in the apocrypha, because this list is different for Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox churces. Anyway, thank you for pointing me to the Italian article. I can actually understand a fair bit of it, especially the references (i.e. the list of citations of Enoch by the Church Fathers). <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 02:54, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
