<p>The article claims that 104 episodes were produced in only a 2-year run...does this sound like an awful lot to anyone else? Is there a list of these episodes somewhere? -Grammaticus Repairo 17:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that this is a weird program, however I have a thirteen month old granddaughter that is crazy about this. I had to do research to make sure that it was ok. She is totally hypnotized when she hears the song Seems like Boohbah is Teletubbies on acid. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdelisle_6821.html" title="User:Bdelisle">Bdelisle</a> 08:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Someone's done way too many drugs. Seriously, I'm watching this now and I'm freaking scared. I would be interested in finding out where the inspiration for this came from. <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrichalcon_4180.html" title="User:Orichalcon">Orichalcon</a> 07:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you think it's worth exploring in the article? By that I mean the show is completely ridiculous to anyone over the age of 12, moreso than Teletubbies. The whole introducing the family sequence is just beyond nuts. It's like they're TRYING to make it a parody. Fishyfred 09:25, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I happened to see this show for the first time this morning. It came on after Hawaiian Yoga (also pretty weird). I don't know what kids are used to these days, but I'm pretty sure Boohbah would have scared the living shit out of me at age 3. The peculiarity of this show cannot be understated. OBVIOUSLY drug inspired in my opinion. Normally I enjoy watching weird stuff while under the influence, but I think this show would be too much. A vision of hell.</p>

<p>Soceity has learned that children are far more capable than was previously thought. So why are T.V. shows continually dumbing down for them? I don't know much about Anne Wood's background, but it would seem to me that both this show and the Teletubbies attempt to appeal to some visual desire in children without giving any real mental stimulation. They lack themes, storylines, and besides garbled half-speak, they lack language. From what I understand about children's programming, these shows are meant to provide some learning experience to the viewer, but they just don't. Maybe I am too angry about children's television, but children should be able to learn and grow from the experiences tailored toward them. I just know that children should be made to think and use their brains because they are very much able to. If we just create shows and books and other media for children which doesn't ask them to grow then why make it at all? CwH</p>
<dl>
<dd>So what you're saying is that this show is an insult to the viewers' intelligence. I'm sorry, but I don't agree with you. The whole point is to encourage viewers to exercise. I suppose you think this show would be better if it preached about the "evils" of "unhealthy foods"? Look, to put it in perspective, you say this show...and I quote, "doesn't ask them to grow"? I think it does, just in a different way then what you might be used to. Educational TV has many different sides to it. It has many different flavors. This show is just one of those flavors.</dd>

<dd>I agree. It's all about exercising children's minds, and a programme like this can, by challenging preset ideas and formats, introduce children to the concept of "thinking outside the box." As much as I like it, this programme is about as "outside the box" as kid's TV gets! Paul-b4 12:14, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This show is hardly educational, nor is it constructive. It is just full of repetitive garbage, just like Teletubbies. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodelyoko193_46cd.html" title="User:Codelyoko193">Codelyoko193</a> 01:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never seen a kid begin to exercise as a result of this show. They just sit and zonk out, watching it they same way they do "Teletubbies". That show was tolerable when you got used to it, but "Boobah" is bloody awful. Apparently if they say "it's an exercise show!" they can pipe any junk they want into our homes and it's socially redeeming. Watching a guy attempt to close a door for ten bloody minutes on end is hardly constructive. Sorry - this doesn't help the article at all but I had to let off some steam. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.131.167.26 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.131.167.26.html" title="User talk:203.131.167.26">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.131.167.26_6751.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.131.167.26">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>"Many people believe it to be a brainwashing program"--Sources? Which particular "many"? (But count me in with the folks who think many, MANY drugs were done during the planning and execution of this program...) <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegina0613_d0d6.html" title="User:Regina0613">Regina0613</a> 00:51, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This statement is not only unqualified, but seems to be of dubious accuracy and definitely POV. Why is "Boohbah" more of a "brainwashing program" than, say, your average McDonalds advert? I think that someone is being a bit silly. Paul-b4 15:49, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree, this statement must be removed until purged of the weasely words "many people believe" and a source is cited as the basis for this belief.</p>
