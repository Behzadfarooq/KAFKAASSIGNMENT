<p>Hi there. I'd like to welcome you to Wikipedia. However, you should know that your username verges on the unacceptable, and another administrator may decide to block you on those grounds (I considered doing it myself, in fact). I therefore <i>strongly</i> suggest that you choose a new username before you become too attached to this one.</p>
<p>If another administrator <i>does</i> block you for a bad username, then your IP will be automatically blocked for 24 hours (a necessary precaution against vandals who create dozens of garbage usernames in a row); if this happens, simply e-mail me via the link on my userpage, and I will fix things for you.</p>
<p>And <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Lovestruck.html" title="Lovestruck">Lovestruck</a></i> sounds like a really cool movie. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 14:06, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop posting material that you've cut and pasted from websites. I've reported three now and it appears I have more to do. If you keep posting copyright material, I'll have to ask an admin to block your account.

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Heart of Asia-1-.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

Unfortunately, we cannot accept copyrighted material, for it is legally incompatible with the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, under which Wikipedia is published.

<p>Please use the proper licensing tag and provide a valid fair-use rationale whenever you upload pictures. For example, when you upload a picture of a promotional material for a tv series, please don't tag it as a "movie poster" or a "DVD cover". Wikipedia has to deal with a lot of legal issues whenever editors do that. Also, by the US/UK Fair-use/Fair-dealing laws (and Philippine copyright law as well, which applies to your additions) you <b>must</b> provide a fair use rationale whenever you upload a picture with a fair-use claim. Lastly, please specify the owner of the copyright of the material you upload and specify the source (please be very specific) of the image. Just a few steps such as these will contribute greatly to your standing as a valued Wikipedia editor.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Mn princess.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Fantastikids-titlecard.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Hdr05-1-.jpg</b>. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear.

<p>As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

<p>You seem to have some major misunderstanding of what you can upload in the way of images to Wikipedia. A look through your talk page would suggest that you really need to seek some help on what images are acceptable. It is also obvious that you are unresponsive to requests or comments from other people. Because of this I have blocked you indefinitely.
