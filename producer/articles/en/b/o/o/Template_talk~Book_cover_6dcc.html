<p>The problems I have with <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">User:UninvitedCompany</a>'s revised template are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't specify the need for <i>low res</i> images. This is important because the uploader/tagger needs to see that this is a requirement. The reason for low res is that the images cannot thus contribute to "real world" piracy of this material.</li>
<li>I think "to illustrate the book in question" is easier to interpret and understand than " for identification and critical commentary on the book and its contents," and would completely include those things under its own definition, but that's just me.</li>
<li>The location of the servers should be noted and the host (Wikimedia Foundation) should be hard-linked (so that if this text is ported somewhere else, the link will still be valid and it will be clear in what context this was originally written).</li>
<li>I think a more blanket "Other use" is better than saying "use other than identification", etc., is a bit more to the point and more accurate. Even using it for identification might not fall under "fair use" policy if you are doing it as part of a for-profit service, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my thoughts, happy to listen to others though. In my mind, the goal of these tags is to A. help the user understand how these images should be used, ideally (i.e. they should be low-res and used in articles to illustrate the book itself, not just something on the cover), and B. they should make clear the very basic components of our "fair use" rationale (I think linking to a more complete and individualized version would be ideal at some point in the future) so that a potential copyright holder can understand that we understand what we are claiming. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:40, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's good in some ways and maybe not so good in others. Here are my thoughts point by point:
<ul>
<li>I think that it is important to include "low resolution".</li>
<li>This is a bit longer, but I think it might make sense to say "to identify and illustrate critical commentary on the book in question". Comments?</li>
<li>Not sure whether I think it's important to include the link to the WMF or not. Have to think about that one.</li>
<li>I'm not too picky on exactly what the copyright infringement sentence says, but I think it is important to mention that use of the image "elsewhere" might be copyright infringement too.</li>
<li>I think it makes more sense to link to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> instead of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>.</li>

<dd>I tend to think the link to the WMF is necessary mostly because they are really the organization in question who is making the fair use claim, and it gives us a clear notice to say that the original context was non-profit, which I think will ward off most people challenging such a use (since we aren't making anything off of it). My real opposition to the "critical commentary" section is that even though it sounds nice and specific, it doesn't really mean much more in practice than "illustrate the book in question". Since we are specifying its <i>usage</i>, I think we should be as blunt as possible, since we are expecting people with potentially less than a high school level of education, and possibly a low level of English competency, to understand it. Linking to WP:FU is probably a more direct thing than WP:CP, though at the moment I think WP:FU is terribly confusing and poorly written on the whole, so I've been avoiding linking to it for the time being.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 15:36, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikimedia Foundation is <b>not</b> the organization making the fair use claim. The editors who upload an image and/or add it to an article are the people making the fair use claim. The Foundation merely provides the servers, and generally avoids interfering in editorial decisions about whether and how to use particular content.

<p>I am not aware of any statute, case law, or legal theory that holds that lower image resolution in any way bolsters a fair use claim. The rationale about contributing to piracy is AFAIK specious, that is, it sounds plausible but has no basis in law.</p>
<p>Fair use law specifically includes criticism but does not specifically include illustration. Therefore, our claim is stronger if we limit our use to criticism.</p>
<p>The purpose of Wikipedia's fair use policy is to <i>permit the content to be reused by for-profit republishers.</i> See the mailing list discussion for more on this. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>On low resolution:</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fair Use. A search engine’s practice of creating small reproductions (“thumbnails”) of images and placing them on its own website (known as “inlining”) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important Factors. The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to index the images and help the public access them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 03 C.D.O.S. 5888 (9th Cir. 2003).)</i><a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
<dd>Beyond this, the fact that it is significantly lower res than the original helps our "does not replace the original" claim, as well as the more speculative claim that our use doesn't encourage future piracy. I also don't see how it can possibly do anything but help our "fair use" claims.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>On criticism vs illustration: in an encyclopedia, I don't really see what the difference would be in this context. I think putting criticism on a separate rationale page would be great, but for the purposes of a tag (which is in this instance instructing a user how to use it), it will just be confusing.</li>
<li>I've been an active participant in the mail list, I don't think that's at all the purpose of Wikipedia's fair use policy. Regardless, I'm not sure what you are getting at with this. "Fair use" images on Wikipedia are likely to <i>not</i> be "fair use" when used by for-profit republishers. One of the main reasons for labeling images as "fair use" and doing so appropriately is to make sure that re-publishers don't accidentally commit copyright infringement.</li>

<p>The "fair use" agreement allows the use of the image "to illustrate an article discussing the book". Can it also be used for an article discussing the author?

<dd>I'm not a lawyer either, but I would disagree if the book is a biography/autobiography of the subject of an article. The article would reference the book, so would certainly qualify as fair use since discussing the author and discussing a biography/autobiography is essentially the same thing. Additionally, in effect, the article becomes "free advertizing" for the publisher, enhancing sales rather than hurting them. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightngle_79a4.html" title="User:Nightngle">Nightngle</a> 14:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Often, the back jacket cover of book covers will have a photo of the author, along with a biographical description of the author.

<p>I believe to qualify as fair use we must acknowledge the translator/publisher for the particular edition which the cover is taken from. This is especially the case for older works which may be published by a number of different translations, in a number of different publishers. To use one publisher's copyrighted cover image as representative of the work without explicitly identifying which publisher that is could be viewed as passing-off that publisher's work (i.e. using their cover image to benefit the editions of their competitors) -- and would thus fall outside a strict interpretation of the legal requirements of fair use / fair dealing, and common courtesy besides. We ought to understand fair use as a <i>de minimis</i> exception to the law, and thus even in fair use every right of the author (including moral rights such as acknowledgement) which is not incompatible with said fair use is still binding upon us. Likewise, by the same logic, in the case of cover images, we ought also acknowledge any cover artist acknowledged in that editions' frontmatter. I believe that the template should be ammended to make the aforementioned requirements explicity. --144.136.115.144 09:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair use law only cares if you hurt the market of the publisher of the individual work. It does not care if you hurt the market of a competitor of the publisher of the individual work. All that matters is whether you are edging out the copyright holder in their own market; if you are in fact helping them in their market (by edging out their competitors) it doesn't come into the fair use qualifications at all. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 14:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This tag specifies that it's providing a fair use assertion for copyrighted book covers, but in fact, there are a number of images tagged with it that are actually in the public domain.
