<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Janet 20YO BMA Awards.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>
<p>For more information on using images, see the following pages:</p>

<p>A tag has been placed on Image:Janet 20YO BMA Awards.jpg, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done for the following reason:</p>
<center><i><b>redundant copy (OR) of Image:Janet 20YO.jpg</b></i></center>
<p>Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#General_criteria" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not meet <i>very</i> basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.</p>
<p>For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">for biographies</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">for web sites</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">for bands</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">for companies</a>.
