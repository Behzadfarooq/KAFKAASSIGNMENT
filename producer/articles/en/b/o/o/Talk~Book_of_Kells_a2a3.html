<p>This page seems to be under regular attack by someone who, perhaps quite rightly, wants to claim it for Kells and not Iona. My own feeling is that the article should reflect the fact that modern scholarship tends to lean towards a date of around 800 ( see <a href="http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/sc/kells/kells.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/sc/kells/kells.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Visitors/attractions.html#book" class="external text" title="http://www.tcd.ie/Visitors/attractions.html#book" rel="nofollow">her</a>. I especially draw attention to the tcd.ie source as they own the damn thing!) and that the location of creation is almost entirely undecidable. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 15:09, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes I seem to concur with your sentiment. What country wouldn't want the [Book of Kells] as part of it's history! All the evidence goes to Ireland, but some modern revisionists who never even saw the damn thing assert that it's made in their neck of the woods. Well spotted, [IanB]</p>
<p>The Abbey of Kells was founded in 554 by Columba. An improper deleation, maybe?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have asource for this? My source (Francoise Henry, <i>The Book of Kells</i>) reads "Since the seventeenth century the Book of Kells has been in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It originally came from Kells (in Co. Meath), where a monastery had been established in the early ninth century, at the time of the Viking invasions, by the monks of the monastery of Iona off the west coast of Scotland." (pg.149 -150). This volume is a standard reference for the Book of Kells, and is cited in every bibliography on the Book I have ever seen. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 00:46, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, I've been doing a bit of research and there is an alternative view that Kells was founded in the 6th century and rebuilt in the early 9th (see Edmund Hogan's <i>Onomasticon Goedelicum</i>). So it's not as clear cut as I first thought. I also think that the article might expand on insular majuscule, as it is not covered in the linked majuscule article. Also, wasn't Iona effectively an Irish community abroad? Certainly generally considered a Celtic monastery and adhered to the Celtic rather than Roman law. I also found <a href="http://pcssd.org/nwoodart/book_of_kells%20WRITTEN%20REPORT.htm" class="external text" title="http://pcssd.org/nwoodart/book_of_kells%20WRITTEN%20REPORT.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which might be useful. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 09:02, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is certainly possible that the 9th century founding was a refounding, but that still makes the earlier founding inconsequential when talking about the Book of Kells. I agree that there needs to be more material on insular majuscule on wikipedia, but I would like to see it in its own article. (after all more than one manuscript uses the script, and I hope one day to have complete aticles for all of them.) I may try to write the Insular majascule article, but I am neither a calligraphernor a paleographer. Iona <i>was</i> effectively an Irish community abroad, however I have hesitated to call the monks themselves Irish because Iona was a missionary center and it is probable that some of the brothers were local converts, especially in the Book of Kells, era (200) years after its founding). This is certainly the case with Lindisfarne, which was a daughter house of Iona. That is why a have used the adjective "Columban" to describe Iona and Kells.<a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 11:47, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Is it only me or are there others also who would find the spelling of medieval in the text and elsewhere repeatedly with the archaic "ae" letter disturbing. After all this is an article in "English" wikipedia where such a letter no longer exists. It looks quite snobbish.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The letter actually does exist in moderen British English. This article uses British spelling, rather than American. You also not colour, rather than color, and several other differences. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 04:54, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Colour has two letters "o" and "u" after the letter "l", both are part of the alphabet used in English. The mediaeval in the text has a single conjoined letter "ae" following the "i", which I really do not believe appears in modern English, whether British, American, Australian or Jamaican. Hence I really do not see the point of the comparison you made. If you believe this is an acceptable spelling, why not use the long "s" which looks like <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/e/8/fe8609fc395704f6ba0420eb485cd0f6.png" alt="\int" /> when speaking of medi(a)eval times? If you are writing about antic Greece, try spelling English words in Greek alphabet. That should be fun.</dd>

<p>"produced by <b>Celtic monks</b> around AD 800."????</p>
<p>What exactly is a Celtic monk? What makes a monk Celtic? I understand the reluctance to use modern terminology such as "Irish" or "Scottish" as these monks did not describe themselves thus. But neither would they have described themselves as Celts or Celtic. What about the term "Gaelic"? The creators of the Book of Kells spoke the Gaelic language, regardless of whether they lived on the island of Ireland or in what is now Scotland. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 08:48, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because we speak of the Celtic Church and not the Gaelic church. There was a difference between the Christianity they practiced and that followed by the rest of Christendom. In particular the monastic system was different. The Gospels in the Book of Kells are in Latin – not Gaelic.

<dd>I got an edit conflect coming here to make both of these points. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 10:16, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I accept your point about the Celtic Church, a term has has general currency. However, I think it is misleading to refer to the adherents of that Church (or brand of Christianity) as "Celtic monks". Likewise we don't refer to the adherents of the "Roman Church" as "Roman priests" or "Roman monks". As it stands, the "Celtic" mentioned in article leads on to a disambiguation page that does not help the average reader in establishing what is actually being referred to. tHow about replacing "Celtic monks" with "adherents of the Celtic Christian tradition" or something along those lines. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 11:28, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"monks of the Celtic church" might be better. After all, many adherents were not monks. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 11:48, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>However, the people who made the Book of Kells were monks, not just adherents.

<dd>Thanks for pointing out the problem with the link from Celtic. I changed it to Celtic Christianity. I hope that helps. Btw that ‘neutrality disputed’ tag is still there. It was put by some who inserted material from a Baptist site, and took offence at its removal.--<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemMcGann_9ec9.html" title="User:ClemMcGann">ClemMcGann</a> 14:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the recent run of this article on the main page, someone added a comment about a facsimile edition on display at Boston College. I assume that this is the 1990 facsimile. I don't doubt that BC has it on display. However, there were 1480 of these facsimiles made, with half of them being reserved for "Anglo-Saxon countries". The vast majority of these were bought by universities and colleges, and many of them put it on display. I would guess that there are dozens, if not hundreds of places with a facsimile on display. For this reason, I would propose that no place other than the church in Kells be listed in this article. (Kells, being the "original" location of the manuscript, is a special case.) Unless, there seems to be a consensus for keeping it, I will remove this statement in a few days. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 02:55, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless we add the locations of all 1480, I see no vlaue in retaining it. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 07:22, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article refers to the 'Abbey of Kells'. I always thought Kells was a monastery, not an abbey. Did Kells have an Abbot? Is that sufficient distinction between an Abbey and a Monastery? In a related note, I'm removing the like to 'Abbey of Kells' as it seems to point to an early 20th-century Baseball player of that name...<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerg2k_3662.html" title="User:Ferg2k">ferg2k</a></p>

<dd>Abbeys are monasteries ruled by an Abbot. The other tyoe of monastery is a Priory, which was ruled by a Prior. Priories were originally "daughter" houses of Abbeys, and the Prior was appointed by the Abbot of the mother house. (These distinctions began to be lost in the late Middle Ages.) Kells was an Abbey. (As,I believe, were all Irish foundations of this period.) <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 03:37, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, the Abbey of Kells baseball player article is a hoax. I've put it on VfD, once it clears that, I'll re-instate the link. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 04:00, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
