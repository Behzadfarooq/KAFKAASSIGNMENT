<p>The template does not follow the recommendations there which are the ones I have been using. MLA style and similar styles are now very widely used in both literary and scientific articles.</p>
<p>Also, I again and again cite material from books that have editors rather than authors. Translators sometimes need to be mentioned (and translators of sections of a book are sometimes different from the editors of a book). Illustrators are also important (sometimes the reason that the work is being cited is the illustrator). Then there is the matter of noting particular editions or providing reprint information. There is the matter of ISBN numbers. There are sometimes re-releases of a book under a different title or even contemporary release of the same work under different titles. Some academic books are part of a continuing series and the series name should be mentioned.</p>
<p>See for example the references I recently added to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_mythology.html" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a> which contain entry after entry that just won't fit this template. And that bibliography contains no individual articles. Individual articles within a book or periodical add futher difficulties.</p>
<p>The idea of a list of templates for every reference likely to be cited numerous times is a very good one, but such a template needs to be far more flexible and complete than this one is (or there needs to be a set of templates for various uses). And templates should agree with the suggested formats in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite_sources</a> or the suggestions there should be changed. I don't think they should be changed.</p>
<p>Sorting material by author and date and using author name and date as the in-text reference is the most reader-friendly method for in-text reference which is why it has caught on so widely for academic use.</p>
<p>The idea of having bibilographic information in one place for a reference is a good one, but needs much more work before it is practical for anything but the very simplest cases. Probably someone with a lot of bibliographic and library cataloguing experience should work on this.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have now updated the template to get it close to MLA. Note that it still requires the authors string to be input precisely to get the right author layout. To get round this issue we would have to have templates Template:Book_ref_1_author ... Template:Book_ref_5_authors. On the face of it, this would be reasonable - however when combined with the need for other templates outlined below, it cause the number of required templates to grow exponentially.</dd>

<dd>This is all good stuff. The "editors" case is extremely common, and I think we should proliferate the templates to allow for that. I think perhaps we should also allow a "further information" parameter which can be populated with illustrator, translator information as required. There is a question of whether "close to MLA" is good enough of course in that case.</dd>

<p>This is a good start! I've had in mind a scheme to make Bib:xyz entries recorded in a separate table in the database, so the bibliography could be searchable and shareable a la images, but that's a lot of hacking... a set of templates like this is a good bridge. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 20:53, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>While still simple, I think this is a great big step in the right direction. Not only will it make citations easier, which encourages adding them, but more importantly it creates a standardized format which can be changed easily. I would recommend retrofitting all existing book references with such a template once it's stabilized. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Derrick Coetzee</a> 03:37, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we can create a single dynamic template, I have the makings of an open-source Bibliography Creator on my website, found <a href="http://br1an.net/MLA/book.html" class="external text" title="http://br1an.net/MLA/book.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (I didn't code it, but the original author's website is down). It's javascript, so presumably a developer could just embed it into something like Wikipedia:Bibliography creator.</p>
<p>I will also shoot this idea over to the guy who is doing the coding for the Firefox Wikipedia extension and see if he could implement it there. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 21:32, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have you noticed that if you do not complete all fields the template shows missing field in the reference. Also if you put field_name= it shows a redundant point. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite style="font-style:normal">Sussex, John (editor) (1990). <i>Stamp World London 90, souvenir handbook</i>, Stamp World Exhibitions.</cite></li>

<dd>WikiBib is nice, Alterego! I don't have much experience with templates (I'm learning, though). <b>(1) How can we standardize the citations even further</b> so that all types have links to the year and consistent punctuation (like the parenthesis and periods in the beginning of most references)? <b>(2) Also, a <a href="http://www.qwikly.com/2005/05/how-to-cite-books-from-google-print.html" class="external text" title="http://www.qwikly.com/2005/05/how-to-cite-books-from-google-print.html" rel="nofollow">Google Print template</a></b> would probably be a good addition. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockOfVictory_2d3e.html" title="User:RockOfVictory">J.

<p>I reverted <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">User:Rdsmith4</a>'s changes of today because they broke articles that use this template. This is a very commonly used template, and thus is a dependency of a lot of pages out there. We shouldn't break it lightly, and if we do break it by changing its interface in an incompatible manner, we must be willing to fix the articles that are broken by the change.

<p>The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> makes a difference between bibliography format and reference list format. In bibliography format, the year comes at the end, as above. In reference list format, the year comes between author and title. In theoretical linguistics publications, at least, we always always <i>always</i> use reference list format. The difference between a bibliography and reference list is that a reference list includes only works actually cited in the article; a bibliography contains all works that might be of interest. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><big>탉</big></a> 20:03, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, with whom are you arguing? The article explicitly says that there are many citation formats, and that the one given is just an example for those people who aren't familiar with one, and that other styles are also acceptable. (For my part, I'm used to the style used in the hard sciences and engineering, which is neither the APA nor the MLA style and doesn't put last name first.) We don't <i>really</i> care what format people use, as long as they include the information. However, it <i>is</i> important that the present page remain as simple as possible to make it easy for people who aren't used to citations — an exhaustive list of many possible alternative styles is counter-productive here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>I checked one CS article from arxiv and noticed that the citation form is also different from what is standard in linguistics. Linguistics papers always cite the reference thus: (Smith 2005), whereas the paper I checked (and I know from experience a lot of papers in hard sciences) cite the reference thus: [1]. In the first method the references list is then listed in alphabetical order by author's last name, which is immediately followed by the date. In the second menthod the references list is listed in order of first mention. Since I mostly edit linguistics articles here I like to follow the conventions linguists are accustomed to. People who write on other sciences will presumably also prefer to follow the conventions their colleagues are accustomed to. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 15:22, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's really the core issue: Wikipedia articles encompass a great variety of disciplines, and adherents of the various disciplines will advocate their preferred citation style over others. (I've already reverted this template when it appears in history articles, and probably will continue to do so, since it seems so "wrong".) A single Wikipedia "house style" seems unlikely to emerge anytime soon. I've considered making a "history book" reference template; perhaps a variety of citation/reference templates would be helpful, with advice on which one to use for the various disciplines. This approach might create a bit more consistency, while keeping the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_retentive.html" title="Anal retentive">anal retentive</a> types (i.e. me) happy. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 17:33, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The logical decision is to support every single citation style there is and let the editor use their discretion as to which is the most appropriate. If done properly, this means that it is something that only has to be done one time, because citation formats are nearly permanent. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 02:00, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

On an unrelated note, can someone fill me in on why <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_United_States_d3bc.html#References" title="Music of the United States">Music of the United States#References</a> has a problem?

<li>Ah so, grasshopper, this would be because whoever inserted the ISBNs failed to prepend the magic "ISBN " koan.

<p>Why do we need this template (or similar ones for news sources and even web references)? What purpose does it serve? It's more time-consuming to create and much harder to read (in edit view) and edit. This would be OK if I could see an advantage over just doing the formatting manually in whatever way seems best (following various developing wiki conventions unless there's reason not to). I can't. From where I'm standing, this looks like an enormous waste of time! Am I missing something? <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 2 July 2005 15:22 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Please</b> keep this in sync with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_link_02b9.html" title="Template:Book reference link">Template:Book reference link</a>, Template:Chapter reference Template:Chapter reference link.

<p>I'd like to extract some parts of these as subparts. For example, if we ever were to change the Year, as I tried before, I'd want the change automatically propagated to the other similar templates. Similarly for the "publisher ID", which could be a subpart. This is even more important in the new things I created: Chapter Reference, Book Reference Link, and Chapter Reference Link. There is a large amount of code duplicated among these three, and I <b>really</b> want to subpart it.</p>
<p>Is there a standard for creating subtemplates (i.e. subparts)? Do we just go ahead and create a Template and use it, and pick some reasonable name? At the very least we need to pick a standard for naming subpart templates.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 08:39, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I went ahead and created a demo of this. I have a few templates named 'Section:...' and I'm using them for common template parts that are shared among one or more templates, so that changes need be made only once rather than propagated. I've done similar things for the following templates: 'Book reference link', 'Chapter reference', 'Chapter reference link'. It's true that it typically doesn't save space in the template definitions, at least for simple ones like these; but it saves a good deal of headache, esp. over a larger tree of templates, as it allows for consistent propagation of changes.</p>

<p>BTW <b>do not revert</b> simply because the formatted result of this template page "looks" wrong. This is a bug in Wikipedia; the actual definition in the Edit box is correct, and calls to these templates look correct with the new definition (actually, they no different from before). <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 12:50, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
