<p>The <b>Book of Enoch</b> is a title given to several <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphy.html" title="Pseudepigraphy">pseudepigraphal</a> works that attribute themselves to <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch%2C_ancestor_of_Noah_a434.html" title="Enoch, ancestor of Noah">Enoch</a>, the great-grandfather of <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>; that is, Enoch son of Jared (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 5:18). Enoch is also one of the three people in the Bible taken up to heaven while still alive (the others being <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>), as the Bible says "And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him." (Genesis 5:24; see also Heb. 11:5).</p>
<p>Most commonly, the phrase "Book of Enoch" refers to <b>1 Enoch</b>, which is wholly extant only in the Ethiopic language. There are two other books named "Enoch": <b><a href="../../../2/_/e/2_Enoch_7cac.html" title="2 Enoch">2 Enoch</a></b> (surviving only in <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Church_Slavonic_09a4.html" title="Old Church Slavonic">Old Slavonic</a>, c. 1st century; Eng. trans. by R. H. Charles (<a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>) <a href="http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/2enoch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/2enoch.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sd/enoch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sd/enoch.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>); and <b><a href="../../../3/_/e/3_Enoch_367d.html" title="3 Enoch">3 Enoch</a></b> (surviving in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, c. 5th-6th century<a href="http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/3enoch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/3enoch.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). The numbering of these texts has been applied by scholars to distinguish the texts from one another. The remainder of this article deals with 1 Enoch only.</p>
<p>Whilst this book does not form part of the Canon of Scripture for the larger Christian Churches, various groups, including the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Church_79e2.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Church</a>, regard parts or all of 1 Enoch to be inspired Scripture. The currently known texts of this work are usually dated to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maccabean.html" title="Maccabean">Maccabean</a> times (ca. <a href="../../../1/6/0/160s_BC_6315.html" title="160s BC">160s BC</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The book consists of five quite distinct major sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Book of Watchers</i> (1 Enoch 1 – 36)</li>
<li>The <i>Book of Parables</i> (1 Enoch 37 – 71) (Also called the <i>Similitudes of Enoch</i>)</li>
<li>The <i>Book of the Heavenly Luminaries</i> (1 Enoch 72 – 82) (Usually abbreviated to <i>The Book of Luminaries</i>. Also called the <i>Astronomical Book</i>)</li>
<li>The <i>Dream Visions</i> (1 Enoch 83 – 90) (Also called the <i>Book of Dreams</i>)</li>
<li>The <i>Epistle of Enoch</i> (1 Enoch 91 – 108)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to some recent scholars,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> these five sections were originally independent works, themselves a product of much editorial arrangement, and were only later <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redaction.html" title="Redaction">redacted</a> into what we now call 1 Enoch. However, this view is opposed by many scholars who maintain the literary integrity of the Book of Enoch, one of the most recent (1990) being Wossenie Yifru.</p>
<p>A great deal of the undercurrent to the narrative of the sections has been claimed to be concerned with the era of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maccabees.html" title="Maccabees">Maccabees</a> and it is for that reason that these western scholars date the sections as having originated during (or after) the 2nd century BC, although these assertions have not proved convincing to all concerned, for what they say is lack of any legitimate evidence of Maccabean-era authorship. 1 Enoch 6–11, part of the <i>Book of Watchers</i>, is thought to have been the original core of that Book, around which the remainder was later added, not least because Enoch is not mentioned in it.</p>
<p>The <i>Book of Parables</i> appears to be based on the <i>Book of Watchers</i>, but presenting a later development of the idea of final judgement – rather than being a final judgement of the fallen angels, the <i>Book of Parables</i> instead presents a final judgement of earthly kings- or <i>the Book of Parables</i> is merely concerned with the kings of the Earth, which seem to have a rather important role in the Book of Enoch's <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">eschatology</a>. The <i>Book of Parables</i> contains several references to a <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_Man_4654.html" title="Son of Man">Son of Man</a></i>, as well as messianic themes; so several scholars have taken the view that this section dates from more Christian times. However, since the term was also just a Jewish way of saying <i>human</i>, and since <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Book_of_Daniel_2207.html" title="The Book of Daniel">the Book of Daniel</a> also refers to a <i>Son of Man</i>, the work may be earlier, and a number of academics have proposed that the <i>Book of Parables</i> may be as early as the late 1st century BC.</p>
<p>The <i>Book of Dreams</i> contains a <i>vision</i> of a history of Israel all the way down to what the majority have interpreted as the revolt of the Maccabees, leading scholars to date it to Maccabean times.</p>
<p>Before the discovery at <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qumran.html" title="Qumran">Qumran</a> (among the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>) of fragments from 1 Enoch, there was some dispute about whether the Greek text was an original Christian production, or whether it was a translation from an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> text redacted in Jewish circles. The chief argument for a Christian author was the occurrence of references to the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a> as the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_man.html" title="Son of man">Son of Man</a>, however such references can also appear in Jewish texts around the turn of the era. The Ethiopian Church considers its Ethiopic version to be the original, since it is the only complete version, while the other languages only have different fragments of the work. Despite this, the majority of western scholars now claim a <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_century_BC_5fa0.html" title="3rd century BC">3rd century BC</a> Jewish authorship for its earliest parts. Before the Qumran discovery, scholars had been unwilling to date it any earlier than the next earliest known reference. Almost all scholars that deal with this book believe it was translated from a Greek edition, perhaps by Saints <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril.html" title="Cyril">Cyril</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodius.html" title="Methodius">Methodius</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../j/%C3%B3/z/J%C3%B3zef_Milik_6d66.html" title="Józef Milik">Józef Milik</a> has suggested that the "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Giants_d98a.html" title="Book of Giants">Book of Giants</a>" found amongst the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> should be part of the collection, appearing after the Book of Watchers. But for various reasons, this theory has not been widely accepted.</p>

<p>The book is referred to, and quoted, in <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Jude_1ffb.html" title="Epistle of Jude">Jude</a>, 1:14–15 (<a href="../../../k/j/v/KJV_3727.html" title="KJV">KJV</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these [men], saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this with Enoch 1:9, translated from the Ethiopian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones To execute judgement upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.</p>

<p>The early Christian father <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> wrote c. 200 AD that the <i>Book of Enoch</i> had been rejected by the Jews because it contained prophecies pertaining to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> text was known to, and quoted by nearly all, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Father_22ad.html" title="Church Father">Church Fathers</a>.

<p>However, some later Fathers denied the canonicity of the book and some even considered the letter of Jude uncanonical because it refers to an "apocryphal" work (Cf. Gerome, Catal. Script.

By the fourth century it was mostly excluded from Christian lists of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a>, and it was omitted from the canon by most of the Christian church (the Ethiopian Orthodox Church being an exception).</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, the text of the <i>Book of Enoch</i> was considered lost until the beginning of the 17th century, when it was confidently asserted that the book was found in an <a href="../../../g/e/27/Ge%27ez.html" title="Ge'ez">Ethiopic</a> translation there, and the learned <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas-Claude_Fabri_de_Peiresc_5d48.html" title="Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc">Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc</a> bought a book that was claimed to be identical to the one quoted by the <i><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Jude_1ffb.html" title="Epistle of Jude">Epistle of Jude</a></i> (and the <i><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Barnabas_35d5.html" title="Epistle of Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a></i> - Epistle xvi. 5) and by the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Father_22ad.html" title="Church Father">Church Fathers</a> <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Martyr_42aa.html" title="Justin Martyr">Justin Martyr</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenaeus.html" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_of_Alexandria_389e.html" title="Clement of Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a>. Although these quotes come exclusively from the first 5 chapters of 1 Enoch. Many<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html#Examples" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"><i><span style="white-space: nowrap;">attribution needed</span></i></a>]</sup> suggest that only these 5 were written by Enoch and the rest were written during the time of the Maccabees. <a href="../../../h/i/o/Hiob_Ludolf_562b.html" title="Hiob Ludolf">Hiob Ludolf</a>, the great Ethiopic scholar of the 17th and 18th centuries, soon claimed it to be a forgery produced by Abba Bahaila Michael (Ludolf, "Commentarius in Hist. Aethip." p. 347).</p>
<p>Better success was achieved by the famous Scottish traveller <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bruce_f292.html" title="James Bruce">James Bruce</a>, who in 1773 returned to Europe from six years in Abyssinia with three copies of a <a href="../../../g/e/27/Ge%27ez.html" title="Ge'ez">Ge'ez</a> version (Bruce, Travels, vol 2, page 422). One is preserved in the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodleian_Library_1cf5.html" title="Bodleian Library">Bodleian Library</a>, another was presented to the royal library of France (the nucleus of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale_625d.html" title="Bibliothèque Nationale">Bibliothèque Nationale</a>), whilst the third was kept by Bruce. The copies remained unused until the 1800s, Silvestre de Sacy, in "Notices sur le livre d'Enoch" in the <i>Magazine Encyclopédique</i>, an vi. tome I, p. 382 included extracts of the books with Latin translations (Enoch chap 1 ,2 ,5-16 ,22 ,32). From this a German translation was made by Rink in 1801.</p>
<p>The first translation of the Bodleian/Ethiopic MS was published in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a> by Professor Richard Laurence, afterwards archbishop of Cashel. Titled <i>The Book of Enoch, the prophet: an apocryphal production, supposed to have been lost for ages; but discovered at the close of the last century in Abyssinia; now first translated from an Ethiopic MS in the Bodleian Library. Oxford, 1821</i>. A second edition was released in 1833 and a third edition in 1838.</p>
<p>Laurence in 1838 also released an edited Ethiopic text named <i>Libri Enoch Prophetae Versio Aethiopica</i>. The text divided into 105 chapters was even then considered unreliable as was published in <i>The severe judgement on Laurence by Dillmann, Das Buch Henoch, p lvii</i>.</p>
<p>Professor A. G. Hoffmann released a translation in 1833 based on this work called <i>Das Buch Henoch in vollständiger Uebersetxung, mit fortlaugendem Commentar, ausführlicher Einleitung und erläuternden Excursen</i> but due to the use at least in part of Laurence's later work there where a number of mistakes that are prevalent. Two other translations came out around the same time one in 1836 called <i>Enoch Retitutus, or an Attempt</i> (Rev Edward Murray) and in 1840 <i>Prophetae veteres Pseudepigraphi, partim ex Abyssinico vel Hebraico sermonibus Latine bersi</i> (Gfrörer). However both are considered to be poor - the 1836 translation most of all and is discussed in Hoffmann, Zweiter Excurs, pages 917-965.</p>
<p>The first reliable edition appeared in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> as <i>Liber Henoch, Aethiopice, ad quinque codicum fidem editus, cum variis lectionibus</i> which is based on the Ethiopic text edited by A. Dillmann, with an accurate translation of the book with reliable notes released in 1853 titled <i>Das Buch Henoch, übersetzt und erklärt</i> which was considered an impeccable edition until the 1900s. A famous edition was published in 1912 by R.H. Charles.</p>
<p>European scholars and academics consider the Ethiopic version to be translated from Greek which was in turn translated from the Aramaic (possibly Hebrew for chapters 37-71)<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. This is vehemently disputed by Ethiopian scholars and clergy, who insist that, since the only complete text of Enoch to surface so far is in Ethiopic, whereas the Aramaic and Greek copies exist only in separate and incomplete fragments, in their view proving their claim that this was the original language written by Enoch himself. In the Ethiopian Orthodox view, the following opening sentence of Enoch is the first and oldest sentence written in any human language, since Enoch was the first to write letters:</p>

<p>In the early period of Ethiopian literature, there was considerable translation activity of much Greek literature into Ge'ez by Ethiopian theologians. Because of this, there are many texts for which both the Ge'ez translation and the Greek original are known; however, in this case, the language and thought of Ge'ez Enoch are thoroughly Semitic, and show no indication of having been transmitted through Greek.</p>

<p>This introduction to the Book of Enoch tells us that Enoch is "a just man, whose eyes were opened by God so that he saw vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the sons of God showed to me, and from them I heard everything, and I knew what I saw, but [these things that I saw will] not [come to pass] for this generation, but for a generation that has yet to come."</p>
<p>It discusses <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> coming to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Sinai_f7ab.html" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> with his hosts to pass judgement on mankind. It also tells us about the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminaries.html" title="Luminaries">luminaries</a> rising and setting in the order and in their own time and never change.</p>
<p>"Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three years till the new comes."</p>
<p>How all things are ordained by God and take place in his own time. The sinners shall perish and the great and the good shall live on in light, joy and peace.</p>
<p>"And all His works go on thus from year to year for ever, and all the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and their tasks change not, but according as God hath ordained so is it done."</p>
<p>The first section of the book depicts the interaction of the fallen angels with mankind; <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samyaza.html" title="Samyaza">Sêmîazâz</a> compels the other 199 fallen angels to take human wives to "<i>beget us children</i>".</p>
<p>"And Semjâzâ, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.'. Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Hermon_6b91.html" title="Mount Hermon">Mount Hermon</a>, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it."</p>
<p>The names of the leaders are given as "<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samyaza.html" title="Samyaza">Samyaza</a> (Shemyazaz), their leader, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araqiel.html" title="Araqiel">Araqiel</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azazel.html" title="Azazel">Râmêêl</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokabiel.html" title="Kokabiel">Kokabiel</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamiel.html" title="Tamiel">Tamiel</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramiel.html" title="Ramiel">Ramiel</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel.html" title="Daniel">Daniel</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chazaqiel.html" title="Chazaqiel">Chazaqiel</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baraqiel.html" title="Baraqiel">Baraqiel</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asael.html" title="Asael">Asael</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armaros.html" title="Armaros">Armaros</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batariel.html" title="Batariel">Batariel</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananiel.html" title="Ananiel">Ananiel</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/q/Zaqiel.html" title="Zaqiel">Zaqiel</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamsiel.html" title="Shamsiel">Shamsiel</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satariel.html" title="Satariel">Satariel</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turiel.html" title="Turiel">Turiel</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yomiel.html" title="Yomiel">Yomiel</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sariel.html" title="Sariel">Sariel</a>."</p>
<p>This results in the creation of the <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephilim.html" title="Nephilim">Nephilim</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a>) or Anakim/Anak (Giants) as they are described in the book:</p>
<p>"And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells <i>[the Ethiopian text gives 300 <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubits.html" title="Cubits">cubits</a> (135 meters), which is probably a corruption of 30 cubits (13.5 meters)]: Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood."</i></p>
<p>It also discusses the teaching of humans by the fallen angels chiefly <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azazel.html" title="Azazel">Azâzêl</a>:</p>
<p>"And Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. Semjâzâ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armârôs the resolving of enchantments, Barâqîjâl, taught astrology, Kôkabêl the constellations, Ezêqêêl the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiêl the signs of the earth, Shamsiêl the signs of the sun, and Sariêl the course of the moon.<i>"</i></p>

Uriel is then sent by God to tell Noah of the coming <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">apocalypse</a> and what he needs to do.</p>
<p>"Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spoke, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: Go to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a> and tell him in my name "Hide thyself!" and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it. And now instruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world."</p>
<p>God commands Raphael to imprison Azâzêl:</p>
<p>"the Lord said to Raphael: 'Bind Azâzêl hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dûdâêl (Gods Kettle/Crucible/Cauldron), and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons. And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azâzêl: to him ascribe all sin."</p>
<p>God gave Gabriel instructions concerning the Nephilim and the imprisonment of the fallen angels:</p>
<p>"And to Gabriel said the Lord: 'Proceed against the biters and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle"</p>
<p>Some suggest that 'biters' should read ' s' but the name is so unusual that some believe that the implication that's made by the reading of 'biters' is more or less correct. The biters may also be the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anunnaki.html" title="Anunnaki">Anunnaki</a>.</p>
<p>The Lord commands Michael to bind the fallen angels. "And the Lord said unto Michael: 'Go, bind Semjâzâ and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness. 12. And when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated. 13. In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire: (and) to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever. And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations."</p>

<hr />
<p>This book mentions the last assault of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentiles.html" title="Gentiles">Gentiles</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic.html" title="Messianic">Messianic</a> period; many western scholars propose it was likely written in the early <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasmonean.html" title="Hasmonean">Hasmonean</a> period (140 BCE to 37 BCE), after the date the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Daniel_27ba.html" title="Book of Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> was written.</p>
<p>There are a great many links between the first book and this one, including the outline of the story and the imprisonment of the leaders and destruction of the Nephilim. The dream includes sections relating to the book of Watchers:</p>
<p>"<i>And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast into that fiery abyss. And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep.</i>" - The fall of the evil ones</p>
<p>"And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their horns. And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them." - The creation of the Nephilim et al.</p>
<p>86:4, 87:3, 88:2, and 89:6 all describe the types of Nephilim that are created during the times described in The Book of Watchers, though this doesn't mean that the authors of both books are the same. Similar references exist in <a href="../../../j/u/b/Jubilees.html" title="Jubilees">Jubilees</a> (7:21-22).</p>
<p>The book describes their release from the Ark along with three bulls white, red and black which are Shem, Japheth, and Ham in 90:9. It also covers the death of Noah described as the white bull and the creation of many nations:</p>
<p>"And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds, so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens" 90:10</p>
<p>It then describes the story of Moses and Aaron (90:13-15) including the miracle of the river splitting in two for them to pass, and the creation of the stone commandments. Eventually arriving at a "pleasant and glorious land" (90:40) where attacked by dogs (Philistines), foxes (Ammonites, Moabites) and wild boars (Esau).</p>
<p>"And that sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it †forsook its glory† and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself unseemly. 45. And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that ram which had †forsaken its glory†." - David replacing Saul as leader of Israel</p>
<p>The creation of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon%27s_temple.html" title="Solomon's temple">Solomon's temple</a> it also describes the house which may be the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabernacle.html" title="Tabernacle">tabernacle</a> "And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower lofty and great was built on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full table before Him". This interpretation is accepted by Dillmann p 262, Vernes p 89, and Schodde p. 107. It also describes the escape of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> the prophet, In 1 Kings 17:2-24 he is fed by 'ravens' so if Kings uses a similar analogy he may have been fed by the Seleucids.</p>
<p>"saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place." This describes the various tribes of Israel 'inviting' in other nations 'betraying his place' i.e. the land promised to their ancestors by God.</p>
<p>This part of the book can be taken to be the kingdom splitting into the northern and southern tribes. That is Israel and Judah eventually leading to Israel falling to the Assyrians in <a href="../../../7/2/1/721_BCE_bf55.html" title="721 BCE">721 BCE</a> and Judah falling to the Babylonians a little over a century later <a href="../../../5/8/7/587_BCE_05c6.html" title="587 BCE">587 BCE</a>.</p>
<p>"And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep." - God abandons Israel for they have abandoned him.</p>
<p>There is also mention in fifty nine of seventy shepherds with their own seasons; there seems to be some debate on the meaning of this section some suggesting that it's a reference to the 70 appointed times in 25:11, 9:2, 1:12 KJV. Another interpretation is the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24. However the general interpretation is that these are simply Angels. This section of the book and later near the end describes the appointment by God of the 70 angels to protect the Israelites from enduring too much harm from the 'beasts and birds'. The later section (110:14) describes how the 70 angels are judged for causing more harm to Israel than he desired finding them guilty and are "cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full of pillars of fire."</p>
<p>"And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished that house." The sacking of Solomon's temple and the tabernacle in Jerusalem by the Babylonians as they take Judah in <a href="../../../5/8/7/587_BCE_05c6.html" title="587 BCE">587 BCE</a>/<a href="../../../5/8/6/586_BCE_41d4.html" title="586 BCE">586 BCE</a> exiling the remaining Jews.</p>
<p>"And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours, and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and began to build up all that had fallen down of that house;"</p>
<p>"Cyrus allowed Sheshbazzar, a prince from the tribe of Judah, to bring the Jews from Babylon back to Jerusalem. Jews were allowed to return with the Temple vessels that the Babylonians had taken. Construction of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Temple_74d1.html" title="Second Temple">Second Temple</a> began." - <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah_04ab.html" title="History of ancient Israel and Judah">History of ancient Israel and Judah</a> the temple is finished being built in <a href="../../../5/1/5/515_BCE_cb72.html" title="515 BCE">515 BCE</a>.</p>
<p>The first part of this next section of the book seem to clearly describe the Maccabean revolt of <a href="../../../1/6/7/167_BCE_a065.html" title="167 BCE">167 BCE</a> against the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucids.html" title="Seleucids">Seleucids</a>.</p>
<p>The following two quotes have been altered from their original form to make the meanings of the animal names clear.</p>
<p>"And I saw in the vision how the [Seleucids] flew upon those [faithful] and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured them. And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the [Seleucids] cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those [faithful], and their eyes were opened. And it looked at them and their eyes opened, and it cried to the sheep, and the rams saw it and all ran to it. And notwithstanding all this those [Macedonians] and vultures and [Seleucids] and [Ptolemies] still kept tearing the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent, but the rams lamented and cried out. And those [Seleucids] fought and battled with it and sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it." 109:8-12</p>
<p>"All the [Macedonians] and vultures and [Seleucids] and [Ptolemies] were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram." 110:16</p>
<p>According to this theory, the first sentence is most likely the death of High Priest Onias III who is murdered which is described in 2 Macc 3, 33-35 (Dies aprox <a href="../../../1/7/1/171_BCE_6e51.html" title="171 BCE">171 BCE</a>). The 'great horn' clearly isn't <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattathias.html" title="Mattathias">Mattathias</a> the initiator of the rebellion as he dies a natural death as described in 1 Maccabees 2:49. It's also not Alexander the Great as the great horn is described as a warrior who has fought the Macedonians, Seleucids and Ptolemies. <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Maccabeus_d8a0.html" title="Judas Maccabeus">Judas Maccabeus</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/7/167_BCE_a065.html" title="167 BCE">167 BCE</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/0/160_BCE_1272.html" title="160 BCE">160 BCE</a>) has fought all three of these, with a large number of winning battles against the Seleucids over a large period of time "<i>they had no power over it</i>". He is also described as "<i>one great horn among six others on the head of a lamb</i>" possibly pertaining to his five brothers and Mattathias. If you take this in context of the history from Maccabeus time Dillman Chrest Aethiop says verse 13 can find its explanation in: 1 Maccabees iii 7; vi. 52; v. 2 Maccabees vi. 8 sqq., 13, 14 1 Maccabees vii 41, 42 2 Maccabees x v, 8 sqq.</p>
<p>The evidence does seem to suggest that this is in fact the life and times of Judas Maccabeus. He is eventually killed by the Seleucids at the Battle of Elasa where he faced "twenty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand cavalry".</p>
<p>At one time it was believed this passage possibly belonged to John Hyrcanus; the only reason for this was the time between Alexander the Great and John Maccabeus was too short. However it has been asserted that evidence shows this section does indeed discuss Maccabeus.</p>
<p>It then describes "And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven fled before their face." This might be simply the "power of God", God was with them to avenge the death. It may also be perhaps <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Maccabaeus_6d3f.html" title="Jonathan Maccabaeus">Jonathan Apphus</a> taking over command of the rebels to battle on after Judas death.</p>
<p>Other possible appearances are John Hyrcanus (<a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrcanus_I_158b.html" title="Hyrcanus I">Hyrcanus I</a>) (Hasmonean dynasty) "And all that had been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, assembled in that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good and had returned to His house." Possibly describing John's reign a time of great peace and prosperity. Certain scholars also claim <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Jannaeus_4c20.html" title="Alexander Jannaeus">Alexander Jannaeus</a> of Judaea is alluded to in this book. The end of the book describes the new Jerusalem, culminating in the birth of a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>:</p>
<p>"And I saw that a white bull was born, with large horns and all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air feared him and made petition to him all the time. 38. And I saw till all their generations were transformed, and they all became white bulls; and the first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head; and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced over it and over all the oxen."</p>
<p>Still another interpretation, which has just as much as credibility, is that the last chapters of this section simply refer to infamous battle of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armageddon.html" title="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>, where all of the nations of the world march against Israel; this interpretation is supported by the War Scroll, which describes what this epic battle may be like, according to the group(s) that existed at Qumram.</p>

<p>This section contains a text called the "Apocalypse of Weeks" which some scholars believe to have been written at about <a href="../../../1/6/7/167_BCE_a065.html" title="167 BCE">167 BCE</a>. A better title could be "the Instruction of Enoch" considering that these chapters aren't written in the form of a letter, which can be found at 93:1-10 and 91:11-17.</p>
<p>No parts of chapters 37-71 were found in Qumran where many of the oldest copies of the Books of Enoch where located. This once lead many experts (Lucke (1832), Hofman (1852), Wiesse (1856), Phillippe (1868) and J.T. Milik (1950)) to believe that those chapters where written in the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century_AD_4fa5.html" title="2nd century AD">2 century 'AD'</a> by a Jewish Christian to enhance Christian beliefs with Enoch's authoritative name. However <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_H._Charlesworth_9a6a.html" title="James H. Charlesworth">James H. Charlesworth</a> in his book "The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha and the New Testament" says:</p>
<p>"It became obvious that Milik had not proved his position, as Fitzmyer pointed out as soon as The Book of Enoch had been published. Repeatedly the specialists on I Enoch have come out in favor of the Jewish nature and its first century C.E. origin, and probable pre-70 date. The list of specialists on I Enoch arguing for this position has become overwhelmingly impressive: Issac, Nickelsburg, Stone, Knibb, Anderson, Black, VanderKam, Greenfield and Sutter. The consensus communis is unparalleled in almost any other area of research; no specialists now argues that I Enoch 37-71 is a Christian and postdates the first century." Page 89.</p>
<p>Chapter 105 some suppose that it may be a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> addition and 108 many believe to be a later addition.</p>

<p>Some of the fallen angels that are given in 1 Enoch have other names such as Rameel ('morning of God'), who becomes Azazel and is also called Gadriel ('wall of God') in Chapter 69. Another example is that Araqiel ('Earth of God') becomes Aretstikapha ('world of distortion') in Chapter 69.</p>
<p>"<i>Azaz</i>" as in <i>Azazel</i> means strength, so the name Azazel can refer to <i>strength of God</i>. But the sense in which it is used most-probably means <i>impudent</i> (showing strength towards) which comes out as <i>arrogant to God</i>. This is also a key point to his being <i>Satan</i> in modern thought.</p>
<p>The suffix of the names 'el' means 'God' (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_names_referring_to_El_0dfa.html" title="List of names referring to El">List of names referring to El</a>) which is used in the names of high ranking angels. The Archangels all include this such as Uriel (Flame of God) or Michael "who is like God?".</p>

<p><i>The Legends of the Jews</i> by Rabbi <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Ginzberg_877e.html" title="Louis Ginzberg">Louis Ginzberg</a> describes Ahiah as the son of the fallen angel Semjâzâ.</p>
