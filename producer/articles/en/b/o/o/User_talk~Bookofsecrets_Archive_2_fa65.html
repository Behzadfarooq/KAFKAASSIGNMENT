<p>Rebelguys2. Read my comments on your talkpage and where it's on the deletion listing.

<dd>I know, image tags are a pain at times. However:
<ul>
<li><b>Joe Byrd</b> — The original image you uploaded will now be deleted, as it's now an orphan (i.e., it's not used anywhere). However, I'm unsure about the new image. The problem wasn't the wording at the bottom of the photo — it's the fact that the photo seems to be owned by a news organization. Unless you have more information to ascertain that the photo is in the public domain (unlikely), has a free license, is owned by you, or has a fair use rationale, the new one needs to be deleted as well. The main issue is that you need to find a fair use rationale, as you're currently assuming that the image is completely free. In addition, I hope you didn't remove the caption yourself (i.e., alter the image), as that is completely illegal.</li>
<li><b>Indian Prayer</b> — In more explicit terms, if Clint Shy has effectively agreed to this: "This image is copyrighted. The copyright holder has irrevocably released all rights to it, allowing it to be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited in any way by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, with or without attribution of the author," that will make more clear the intention of the current tag. I don't think anyone's a fan of the current tag; it gets a point across, though it's not very clear. However, there still remain grounds for deletion. The problem is that the image is unencyclopedic. It doesn't really demonstrate anything useful, as its just a montage of various objects for purely aesthetic value. Image guidelines only explicitly allow for the use of unencyclopedic images if they're "[i]mages with you, friends or family" — and then only on user pages. There <i>is no</i> clause for keeping other types of images for user pages and there <i>is</i> precedent for nominating similar images for deletion. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 03:21, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have deleted "IndianPrayer" from my userpage. I will delete "JoeByrd" from that article. The "JoeByrd" picture situation is understandable. The other is not. The thing that concerns me is this.

<p>I had planned to leave Wikipedia for good. My brother User:Waya sahoni is willing to teach me the ways of our people. This is something I've desired for so long. I seek to learn. <b>I'm going to try very hard not to explode anymore, act foolish, and fight with others. I have no plans of vandalizing ever again. Please let Waya-sahoni work with me and I believe I can be an asset to the articles herein. He knew how to approach me in a manner to cool me off.</b> I am grateful for his wisdom in doing this. American Indians do not handle situations in the same manner as those of European backgrounds. I don't know a great deal about my people, but I do know that I've always felt different than a great number of those around me in school and elsewhere. I didn't know why, but now I believe it was my American Indian blood trying to awaken inside. It is awakened and it feels natural for me. <b>So please accept my humble apologies for acting so very terrible since I first arrived at Wikipedia in December.</b></p>

<p>With regards to your talk page archiving here and at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7ECherokee_society_9233.html" title="Talk:Cherokee society">Talk:Cherokee society</a>, most generally, talk page archives contain months of content, not single comments. I would reconsider your archiving system and move all of the old comments out onto this main page. Archive every few months or set number of comments, like every 25 or 50 comments. Thanks. — <a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScm83x_0490.html" title="User talk:Scm83x">talk</a></sup> <a href="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b9/Hookem_hand.gif/18px-Hookem_hand.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../h/o/o/Image%7EHookem_hand.gif_47a3.html" /></a> 02:46, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I do my archiving in this manner because I simply detest going to a talkpage and going through mountains of comments. It is a waste of time. I may need to have more comments on each archive page and can willing do that. However, keeping talkpages tidy is a pet project of mine. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 15:07, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would argue that this actually makes review talk pages more complicated, because you must open several different pages in order to see the progression of comments on a talk page. If this is your desire though, please only do so in your user space and leave talk page archiving in the main space to convention of larger comment blocks.

<li>I can go along with what you're saying. Usually if I have a mountain of comments to read I most likely will not read them. Going to another page just makes it easier for my mind to comprehend. Of course I have medical reasons for this that the rest of you may not have to deal with. But I will not go into that unless someone inquires.

<p>Please take over my edits on the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Vernon_Merkey_d6f4.html" title="Jeffrey Vernon Merkey">Jeffrey Vernon Merkey</a> article and review the article for POV and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. The article fails both. Be careful, there are a large number of vandals who will engage in revert wars related to the article, and there are several adminitrators violating wikipedia policies on primary and secondary sources by supporting them. Be on your best behavior. I am going to focus on other articles since they typically resort to sock puppet allegations to drive editors from the article. We need more evidence on their conduct and edit history to review whether the article should be dropped from the indigeneous peoples article. Waya sahoni 01:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Waya sahoni. Who is Jeffrey Vernon Merkey? I've seen the name and that you've been accused of being this person. Before I go into this article please tell me about him. My email is <a href="http://emailto:mythicweb@earthlink.net" class="external text" title="http://emailto:mythicweb@earthlink.net" rel="nofollow">MythicWeb</a>--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 02:21, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He is one of our brothers and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The people on that article are members of SCOX, an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples. These people have been posting a lot of negative content and POV pushing about him. They acuse anyone of sockpuppetry who goes near the article. Thanks for policing my user page. Please feel free to revert it again -- they are creating sockpuppets accounts and are warring with us over some discussion I posted to the Talk page. A very rowdy group. They also accussed you of sockpuppetry and of being Merkey. Waya sahoni 03:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No one ever accused Bookofsecrets of being Merkey. I pointed out his admission and apology for past sockpuppetry and suggested that he should teach you to abandon that behavior. The Yahoo SCOX bulletin board discusses the SCO Group stock and related issues, including Merkey's aid to SCO's cause and his business connections to them. Claiming that they are an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples is both <strike>libelous</strike> untrue and silly. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 03:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I saw that you removed the archives box at the Joe Byrd article, and that it raised some eyebrows. Basically, when the article was moved from its original name to the new one, the archive page wasn't moved along with it. I've gone ahead and fixed it. In the future, don't hesitate to ask for some help; deleting things outright often lead to people forgetting about the issue, rather than remembering to fix it.

<li>There was nothing on the archive page the last time I checked it. This is why I deleted it. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 23:14, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has been noticed that certain individuals on wikipedia have nasal challenges with any articles that other individuals have to do with. I find this unfair and unjust. As for the Joe Byrd article I suggest keeping this copyright issue under wraps until it is has researched and the issue has been settled. I do not support those who badger others unnecessarily.</li>

<p>Hello, Book of Secrets. I take seriously the need for admins to be of the highest possible calibre. Therefore, I would like to inquire as to why you think Scm would not make a good admin. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scm83x&amp;diff=43763096&amp;oldid=43761046" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scm83x&amp;diff=43763096&amp;oldid=43761046" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Please let me know what troubles you. I'll help in any way I can.
