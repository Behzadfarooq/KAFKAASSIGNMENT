<p>From the article and photo's title, I'm guessing that a sash, in this context, is a thin strip of cloth sewn into the binding, but it might be good to include a definition of the term.</p>

<p>My article and written contribution to 'Restoration hand binding' seemed to me to add rich relevant content to the page. Furthermore it seemed only fair to acknowledge the creator and donator of the fine image of an example: 'Restoration hand binding' - A Royal Binding of A Geneva Bible by Paul Tronson. This content was further enhanced by comments from Andrew Clarke.</p>
<p>In addition it seemed only reasonable to create an external link to Mr Tronson's web site that is on the front page for this keyword phrase on every search engine.</p>

<dd>I agree that "Restoration hand binding" does add useful information to the content of the article, however wikipedia is not a place to promote or advertise businesses which sell products or offer services, either in the articles in return for any contribution, nor in "External links" sections.<br /></dd>

<p>Dear LDHan As you only joined Wikipedia in January 06, I do not believe that you have sufficient experience to warrant vexatiously deleting people's genuine contributions. see 'foxing' and 'bookbinding.'</p>
<p>As far as this page 'bookbinding' is concerned, Mr Paul Tronson is one of only three bookbinders in the world who can do this supremely difficult work as evidenced by the image he has donated to the site: Royal Binding. He is also the only person in the world to have developed an aqueous solution to remove foxing.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is no restriction in Wikipedia on referring to a 'noted' named personage or referencing their web site in the page or in external links.</p>
<p>~~careersnet</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know little about bookbinding, but I know something about Wikipedia, and I'm sorry, Careersnet, you're way out of line here. There is no "probationary period" at Wikipedia; someone who's been here three months has as much right to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> as someone who's been here for three years. In fact, I as an anonymous user (by personal choice) have the right to delete anything you say in an article if I can justify it. <a href="../../../l/d/h/User%7ELDHan_af5b.html" title="User:LDHan">LDHan</a> cited the Wikipedia guidelines on external links; that's exactly the "restriction" you claim to be unaware of, and frankly I don't see how it could be much clearer. You should really familiarize yourself with such basic guidelines as "<a href="../../../s/y/p/WP%7ESYP_6f47.html" title="WP:SYP">sign talk page posts with four tildes</a>" before you accuse people who signed up two months after you (and whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=LDHan" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=LDHan" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> outnumber <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Careersnet" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Careersnet" rel="nofollow">yours</a> by several orders of magnitude, not that it really matters) of lacking "sufficient experience" with Wikipedia. I don't mean this to sound combative, I just want like it when people behave responsibly, follow policy, and don't use arbitrary rationalizations to ignore editors who do something they disagree with. 69.140.12.199 04:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anon, thanks for your comments. I thought it would be just a waste of time to reply to careersnet, he/she is obviously a spammer, check past edits, also has a spam user name. <a href="../../../l/d/h/User%7ELDHan_af5b.html" title="User:LDHan">LDHan</a> 18:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re <b>verso/recto</b>: Okay, the <b>recto</b> page faces left, but it's on the right-hand side and that's why it's called a "recto" (Latin: right). The description here seems needlessly obtuse.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Library binding is best kept as a link from bookbinding. It is a specific subset of binding, where leaf attachment is of primary importance (usually separated into double fan adhesive, oversewn, Smythe sewn, or retain original sewing). It implies a hardcover binding, usually covered in buckram or c-cloth (for smaller bindings). It also implies a series of one-off bindings produced in a factory setting, as opposed to hand binding (non-factory) or trade binding (where multiples of identical bindings are produced). Library Binding needs to be fleshed out, but then so does the bookbinding article. There's more information out there on Bookbinding than can be said in one page. (Nosey 02:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Library binding might deserve its own page, but as it stands no one has edited it since 5/06 (the merge proposal), and nothing of substance has been added in close to eighteen months. I support the merger. <a href="../../../j/l/i/User%7EJlittlet_048e.html" title="User:Jlittlet">Jlittlet</a> 23:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is someone out there deleting links to legitimate free for all books on bookbinding and allied trades published on the internet. These links are not spam and are totally justified. The irony is that the editor is obviously not versed in the trade of bookbinding, but only has the vanity to pretend knowledge of it. Will the editors of wikipedia contain this mad person? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bibliopegist (<a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliopegist_b4d2.html" title="User talk:Bibliopegist">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliopegist_03be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliopegist">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<dd>Did you scan these books yourself? They look interesting, but that isn't the only criterion that applies here. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 06:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I scanned the books myself, after of course buying them and making sure they are copyright free.</p>
<p>"They look interesting" - what would you know, are you an expert in the field? One of the book is totally out of print as it was published in very limited quantity and never reprinted and to boot, it's on a topic of which information is scarce&#160;: Gilding. Now I have read the constraints in posting to wikipedia and I have followed the rules, that your opinion on the quality of the books I offer in links are not meeting a certain criterion that would apply here is preposterous and your policing is at best "flying by the seat of your pants", at worse, malicious and reprehensible.</p>
<p>To top my argument, I would invite you to really visit my web site at bookbinding.com and look hard for any links to a price list or any phrase solliciting business, any promotion asking visitors to contact me for business. The fact is that I am not looking for more clients, I have enough to keep me busy long after I am gone.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will continue scanning books and posting them on my web site and if wikipedia is not interested in my contribution, so be it. I do not need the link to boost my site, is is first page on Yahoo and Google when you keyword bookbinding. What do they know that you don't?</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether Bookbinding or Library Bindings is the appropriate place, but I have come across a type of binding called "turtleback" that isn't included herein and I'm curious as to what this is.
