Booker T. Washington</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Booker Taliaferro Washington</b> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>, – <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> educator, author and leader of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> community.</p>
<p>Washington was born into <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> to a white father and a black slave mother on a rural farm in southwestern <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_County%2C_Virginia_6911.html" title="Franklin County, Virginia">Virginia</a>; the slaves were freed in 1865. He attended <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_University_31d3.html" title="Hampton University">Hampton University</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayland_Seminary_663b.html" title="Wayland Seminary">Wayland Seminary</a>. After returning to Hampton as an instructor, he was named in 1881 as the first leader of the new <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_school.html" title="Normal school">normal school</a> (teachers' college) which became <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_University_4642.html" title="Tuskegee University">Tuskegee University</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>.</p>
<p>Washington was the dominant figure in the African American community in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> from 1890 to 1915, especially after he achieved prominence for his <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Compromise_5660.html" title="Atlanta Compromise">Atlanta Address of 1895</a>. To many politicians and the public in general, he was seen as a popular spokesperson for African American citizens. Representing the last generation of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black</a> leaders born into slavery, he was credible when speaking publicly and seeking educational improvements for those <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedmen.html" title="Freedmen">freedmen</a> who had remained in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_8dce.html" title="New South">New South</a> in an uneasy <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_vivendi.html" title="Modus vivendi">modus vivendi</a> with the white southerners. Throughout the final 20 years of his life, he maintained this standing through a nationwide network of core supporters in many communities, including black educators, ministers, editors and businessmen, especially those who were liberal-thinking on social and educational issues. He gained access to top national leaders in politics, philanthropy and education, and was awarded honorary degrees. Critics called his network of supporters the "Tuskegee Machine."</p>
<p>Late in his career, Dr. Washington was criticized by the leaders of the <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, which was formed in 1909, especially <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._DuBois_289a.html" title="W.E.B. DuBois">W.E.B. DuBois</a>, who demanded a harder line on <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> protests. After being labeled "The Great Accommodator" by DuBois, Dr. Washington replied that confrontation would lead to disaster for the outnumbered blacks, and that cooperation with supportive whites was the only way to overcome pervasive racism in the long run. Although he did some aggressive civil rights work secretively, such as funding court cases,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> he seemed to truly believe in skillful accommodation to many of the social realities of the age of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. While apparently resolved to many undesirable social conditions in the short term, he also clearly had his eyes on a better future for blacks. Through his own personal experience, Dr. Washington knew that good educations were a major and powerful tool for individuals to collectively accomplish that better future.</p>
<p>Washington's philosophy and tireless work on education issues helped him enlist both the moral and substantial financial support of many <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philanthropist.html" title="Philanthropist">philanthropists</a>. He became friends with such self-made men from modest beginnings as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Oil_06fa.html" title="Standard Oil">Standard Oil</a> magnate <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Rogers_f354.html" title="Henry H. Rogers">Henry Huttleston Rogers</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears%2C_Roebuck_and_Company_1c2e.html" title="Sears, Roebuck and Company">Sears, Roebuck and Company</a> President <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Rosenwald_77c4.html" title="Julius Rosenwald">Julius Rosenwald</a>. These individuals and many other wealthy men and women funded his causes, such as supporting the institutions of higher education at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_University_31d3.html" title="Hampton University">Hampton</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_University_4642.html" title="Tuskegee University">Tuskegee</a>. Each school was originally founded to produce teachers. However, many had often gone back to their local communities to find precious few schools and educational resources to work with in the largely impoverished South. To address those needs, through provision of millions of dollars and innovative <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matching_funds.html" title="Matching funds">matching funds</a> programs, Dr. Washington and his philanthropic network stimulated local community contributions to build small community schools. Together, these efforts eventually established and operated over 5,000 schools and supporting resources for the betterment of blacks throughout <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">the South</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The local schools were a source of much community pride and were of priceless value to African-American families during those troubled times in public education. This work was a major part of his legacy and was continued (and expanded through the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosenwald_Fund_a796.html" title="Rosenwald Fund">Rosenwald Fund</a> and others) for many years after Washington's death in 1915.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Washington did much to improve the overall friendship and working relationship between the races in the United States. His autobiography, <i><a href="../../../u/p/_/Up_From_Slavery_fa40.html" title="Up From Slavery">Up From Slavery</a></i>, first published in 1901, is still widely read today.</p>

Booker T. Washington with third wife Margaret James Murray and his two sons.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Booker T. Washington was born on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a> on the Burroughs farm at the community of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hale%27s_Ford%2C_Virginia_c4de.html" title="Hale's Ford, Virginia">Hale's Ford, Virginia</a>. His mother Jane was a black slave who worked as a cook and his father was a white man who owned a nearby farm. Under the laws of the time, his mother's status also made young Booker a slave. The "T" in his name stood for <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliaferro.html" title="Taliaferro">Taliaferro</a>, his owner's name. He recalled Emancipation in early 1865: [<i>Up from Slavery</i> 19-21]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom.... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper -- the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation_Proclamation_d12b.html" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mom, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1865, at the age of nine, Booker and his brother John and his sister, Amanda, moved to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malden%2C_West_Virginia_1cde.html" title="Malden, West Virginia">Malden</a> in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanawha_County%2C_West_Virginia_d31a.html" title="Kanawha County, West Virginia">Kanawha County, West Virginia</a> with their mother to join his stepfather, whose last name was Washington. He worked with his mother and other free blacks as a salt-packer and in a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> mine. He even signed up briefly as a hired hand on a steamboat. However, soon he became employed as a houseboy for <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola_Ruffner_236b.html" title="Viola Ruffner">Viola Ruffner (née Knapp)</a>, the wife of General Lewis Ruffner, who owned the salt-furnace and coal mine. Many other houseboys had failed to satisfy the demanding and methodical Mrs. Ruffner, but Booker's diligence and attention to detail met her standards. Encouraged to do so by Mrs. Ruffner, when he could, young Booker attended school and learned to read and to write. And soon, he sought even more education than was available in his community.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Leaving Malden at sixteen, Washington enrolled at the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_University_31d3.html" title="Hampton University">Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute</a>, in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton%2C_Virginia_6cea.html" title="Hampton, Virginia">Hampton, Virginia</a>. Students with little income such as Washington could get a place there by working to pay their way. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_school.html" title="Normal school">normal school</a> (teachers college) at Hampton was founded for the purpose of training black teachers and had been largely funded by church groups and individuals such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jackson_Palmer_94e6.html" title="William Jackson Palmer">William Jackson Palmer</a>, a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Society_of_Friends_321e.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a>, among others. In many ways he was back where he had started, earning a living through menial tasks, but his time at Hampton led him away from a life of labor. From 1878 to 1879 he attended <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayland_Seminary_663b.html" title="Wayland Seminary">Wayland Seminary</a> in Washington, D.C., and returned to teach at Hampton. Soon, Hampton officials recommended him to become the first principal of a similar school being founded in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tuskegee</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Adams_d0b8.html" title="Lewis Adams">Lewis Adams</a> and other organizers of a new normal school in <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee%2C_Alabama_c620.html" title="Tuskegee, Alabama">Tuskegee, Alabama</a> found the energetic and visionary leader they sought in 25 year-old Booker T. Washington. Upon the strong recommendation of Hampton University founder <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_C._Armstrong_f753.html" title="Samuel C. Armstrong">Samuel C. Armstrong</a>, Adams and Tuskegee's governing body hired Washington, even though such positions had always been held by whites up until that time. Washington thus became the first principal of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute. The new school opened on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>, initially using space rented from a local church. The next year, Washington purchased a former <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a>, which became the permanent site of the campus. The school later grew to become the present-day <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_University_4642.html" title="Tuskegee University">Tuskegee University</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><br />
Tuskegee provided an academic education and instruction for teachers, but placed more emphasis on providing young black boys with practical skills such as carpentry and masonry. The institute illustrates Washington's aspirations for his race. His theory was, that by providing these skills, African Americans would play their part in society and this would lead to acceptance by white Americans. He believed that African Americans would eventually gain full <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> by showing themselves to be responsible, reliable American citizens. He was head of the school until his death in 1915. By then Tuskegee's endowment had grown to over $1.5 million, compared to the initial $2,000 annual appropriation.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

Washington next wed Olivia A. Davidson in 1885.

Washington met Davidson at Tuskegee, where she had come to teach. She later became the assistant principal there. They had two sons, Booker T.

<p>Blacks were solidly Republican, but after 1890 many lost the vote in the deep South (but continued to vote in border and northern states). Washington emerged as their spokesman and was routinely consulted by Republican national about the appointment of African Americans to political positions throughout the nation. He worked and socialized with many white politicians and notables. He argued that the surest way for blacks eventually to gain equal rights was to demonstrate patience, industry, thrift, and usefulness and said that these were the key to improved conditions for African Americans in the United States and that they could not expect too much, having only just been granted emancipation.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Washington associated with the richest and most powerful businessmen and politicians of the era. He was seen as a spokesperson for African Americans and became a conduit for funding educational programs.

<p>A representative case of an exceptional relationship was Washington's friendship with millionaire industrialist and financier <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Rogers_f354.html" title="Henry H. Rogers">Henry H. Rogers</a> (1840-1909).

Around 1894, Rogers heard Washington speak at <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. The next day, he contacted Washington and requested a meeting, during which Washington later recounted that he was told that Rogers "was surprised that no one had 'passed the hat' after the speech." The meeting began a close relationship that was to extend over a period of 15 years. Although he and the very-private Rogers openly became visible to the public as friends, and Washington was a frequent guest at Rogers' New York office, his <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairhaven%2C_Massachusetts_3d4c.html" title="Fairhaven, Massachusetts">Fairhaven, Massachusetts</a> summer home, and aboard his steam yacht <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanawha_%281899%29.html" title="Kanawha (1899)"><i>Kanawha</i></a>, the true depth and scope of their relationship was not publicly revealed until after Roger's sudden death of an an <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">apoplectic stroke</a> in May 1909.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Rosenwald_77c4.html" title="Julius Rosenwald">Julius Rosenwald</a> (1862-1932) was another self-made wealthy man with whom Dr. Washington found common ground.

Rosenwald was a philanthropist who was deeply concerned about the poor state of African American education, especially in the Southern states.</p>
<p>In 1912 Rosenwald was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of Tuskegee Institute, a position he held for the remainder of his life. Rosenwald endowed Tuskegee so that Dr. Washington could spend less time traveling to seek funding and devote more time towards management of the school. Later in 1912, Rosenwald provided funds for a pilot program involving six new small schools in rural Alabama, which were designed, constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914 and overseen by Tuskegee; the model proved successful. Rosenwald established the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosenwald_Fund_a796.html" title="Rosenwald Fund">The Rosenwald Fund</a>. The school building program was one of its largest programs. Using state-of-the-art architectural plans initially drawn by professors at Tuskegee Institute, the Rosenwald Fund spent over four million dollars to help build 4,977 schools, 217 teachers' homes, and 163 shop buildings in 883 counties in 15 states, from Maryland to Texas.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Rosenwald Fund used a system of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matching_funds.html" title="Matching funds">matching grants</a>, and black communities raised more than $4.7 million to aid the construction.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> These schools became known as <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosenwald_Schools_9ede.html" title="Rosenwald Schools">Rosenwald Schools</a>.

<li>"It is at the bottom of life we must begin, not at the top."</li>
<li>"Think about it: We went into slavery pagans; we came out Christians. We went into slavery pieces of property; we came out American citizens. We went into slavery with chains clanking about our wrists; we came out with the American ballot in our hands...Notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, we are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe." - in <i>Up From Slavery</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"There is another class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs -- partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs....There is a certain class of race-problem solvers who do not want the patient to get well, because as long as the disease holds out they have not only an easy means of making a living, but also an easy medium through which to make themselves prominent before the public."</li>

<li>"I will not say that [I] became discouraged, for as I now look back over my life I do not recall that I ever became discouraged over anything that I set out to accomplish.

<li>"I have spoken of my admiration for General Armstrong, and yet he was but a type of that Christlike body of men and women who went into the Negro schools at the close of the war by the hundreds to assist in lifting up my race.
