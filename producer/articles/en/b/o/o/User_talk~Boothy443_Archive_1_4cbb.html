<p>Hey, thanks for working on the USMifiying of the USM articles. I had emailed people at each school asking for mottos, seals, and such and only Frostburg had responded. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardjp_053d.html" title="User:Howardjp">Howardjp</a> 13:50, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the help with national teams articles... I'm doing cleanup on Guinea-Bissau right now; for team colors the best reference is: <a href="http://jason.soffe.free.fr/africa/index.html" class="external free" title="http://jason.soffe.free.fr/africa/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://jason.soffe.free.fr/africa/index.html</a> . Also, for categories, do not put <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_national_football_teams_b21f.html" title="Category:African national football teams">Category:African national football teams</a> because the CAF Teams template already includes that. Since sport categories do not exist for most of those countries, add it to the culture category (<a href="../../../g/u/i/Category%7EGuinea-Bissauan_culture_88c8.html" title="Category:Guinea-Bissauan culture">Category:Guinea-Bissauan culture</a>). Sorry if I'm nitpicking, but again thanks for the help!</p>
<p>I get the logos here: <a href="http://users.skynet.be/pluto/Textfifa/organization.html" class="external free" title="http://users.skynet.be/pluto/Textfifa/organization.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.skynet.be/pluto/Textfifa/organization.html</a> (some of them are good, some of them need cleanup), if not there, then at FIFA. If you get to Asia, the best ones are at <a href="http://www.the-afc.com/english/national/default.asp?mAction=new&amp;where=national" class="external free" title="http://www.the-afc.com/english/national/default.asp?mAction=new&amp;where=national" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-afc.com/english/national/default.asp?mAction=new&amp;where=national</a>. All team results are here: <a href="http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/landen-intres.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/landen-intres.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/landen-intres.html</a> (I noticed your "first matches" were off).</p>
<p>For the kits, let's say for Guinea-Bissau it says:<br />
1 Red, green, yellow<br />
Green<br />
Green<br />
2 Yellow, green, red<br />
Yellow<br />
Yellow<br />
1 = Home, 2 = Away. First line is shirt, second is shorts, third is socks. If there's more than one color listed, just take the first one -- it's the best we can do for these "obscure" teams.</p>
<p>Comoros are neither a member of FIFA or CAF. There are a number of teams which are like that (Reunion, Monaco, Greenland, a bunch of Oceanian teams). If one of these appears in another team's infobox, <i>Italicize</i> it as opposed to providing a link. Don't worry about them for now, if they're not listed on the Confederation's page, no need for them... Yet.</p>
<p>On associations: make sure the head coach matches up to the one on the national team page; those are all current (more or less), I noticed the one on Armenia was off. Also, make sure the association link on the team page goes to the assocaition... The ones for Azerbaijan and Andorra didn't. Other than that, excellent...</p>
<p>To verify coaches, I check the team's last match at <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com" class="external free" title="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a>, so according to <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/mr/mr36501.html" class="external free" title="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/mr/mr36501.html" rel="nofollow">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/mr/mr36501.html</a>, Armenia's coach is Cassoni. Most, if not all, of the national team pages are correct, especially for countries still invovled in World Cup qualifying. --<a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryazan_bb4e.html" title="User:Dryazan">Dryazan</a> 18:56, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Next on the agenda? I was thinking of adding <a href="../../../f/o/o/Template%7EFootball_club_infobox_d555.html" title="Template:Football club infobox">Template:Football club infobox</a> to all major teams that are missing it, starting with Spanish clubs. <a href="http://www.marca.es" class="external free" title="http://www.marca.es" rel="nofollow">http://www.marca.es</a> is a good resource for those. I don't think there's much value of doing association pages for non-European teams... Maybe just finish up South America. --<a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryazan_bb4e.html" title="User:Dryazan">Dryazan</a> 04:08, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>When did the agency change its name to MTA Maryland? The official site still calls it the Maryland Transit Administration, and a Google news search turns up nothing. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 19:09, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Maryland Transit Administration is the statewide agency in control of Mass Transit in the state of Maryland. MTA Maryland, is the division of the agency that provides transit services in the Baltimore Metro Area"
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't look that way from the official site, and a name split like that seems very counterintuitive. Anyway, the article is about the whole agency, not just the Baltimore area. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 19:17, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Er, never mind, the article is only about the Baltimore area. But the name still doesn't make any sense - the site for the whole system is mtamaryland.com, so why would the Baltimore division be called MTA Maryland? --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 19:19, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>From a bit more looking on the official site, it looks like "MTA Maryland" is an alternate name that they use, possibly to avoid confusion with the New York City MTA. But the organization is named Maryland Transit Administration, so the first line should read something like The <b>Maryland Transit Administration</b>, sometimes knwon as <b>MTA Maryland</b> to avoid confusion with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority_%28New_York%29_e8de.html" title="Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)">New York's MTA</a>, and so on. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 19:24, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I say yes, but only if the logo is of good quality. If you have adobe photoshop or illustrator, the best thing to use is <a href="http://www.hqfl.dk" class="external free" title="http://www.hqfl.dk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hqfl.dk</a>, and convert the image to .gif or .png. The problem is, that site doesn't have English logos because of some copyright issues... There're bound to be some other logo sites out there with images already in .gif format, I just haven't looked yet. When placing the logo, I usually do it on the left like this: [[Image:Brescia_logo.gif|100px|left|logo]] --<a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryazan_bb4e.html" title="User:Dryazan">Dryazan</a> 14:48, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You shouldn't remove VfD tags from articles, even if you have significantly improved them. I agree that Morris Peterson shouldn't be deleted but, now someone has listed it, it has to go to a vote. Removing the tag, even accidentally, might be construed as vandalism by some users. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:22, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you, people are very quick to put stuff they don't know about up for deletion rather than actually checking anywhere first. I wasn't criticising you, I was just saying that once something gets put up for deletion, no matter how ridiculous it seems, it has to go to a vote by the community. Appearing to tamper with process can get you into trouble, just making sure you don't get into trouble through ignorance of policy.

Of course the sole "cause" of the Civil War was not slavery. At the same time, the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War_71dc.html" title="Origins of the American Civil War">Origins of the American Civil War</a> is more nuanced than you make it out to be. The article provides a generous range of contexts. Some sections indeed focus on slavery and free labor. Others deal with the role of political agitation in all sections in the coming of the war in the context of an era in which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid expansion of democracy. Others focus on the South's economic dependence and tariffs (especially the section dealing with the panic of 1857). Others deal with overall decline of the South's influence in the federal government on questions of tariffs, banking policy, public land, and of subsidies to railroads... Also, there is a tendency to confuse the discussion of slavery as an underlying cause with that of a direct "cause." At the center of the two diverging societies were differences in labor systems. The plantation system, in effect, determined the structure of Southern society, just as free labor determined the structure of Northern society. These are the structural realities underlying the divergence between North and South on moral, cultural, social, ideological, political, and economic issues. In short, that's why the discussion of slavery is as detailed as it is. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:28, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Basically, it boils down to this. Gzornenplatz believes that the code for the infobox should be kept inside the original article, while I believe that it is much more efficient, clear, and easy to make a template that includes the relevant information. Gzornenplatz has taken to arbitrarily reverting any article that includes a templated infobox, even if they are firmly established. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">Páll</a> 03:26, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, no, you misunderstood. Gzornenplatz is not <b>REMOVING</b> the infoboxes, but i think its unnecessary to have all the code sitting on top of the Wikipedia article. I basically redid the tables in another format and put them back into the articles, and he wants it done the old way and keeps reverting it without reaching concensus. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">Páll</a> 03:31, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bridges and tunnels (all that I've been adding, at least) carry roads, and these are tolled. Thus they are toll roads.

<dd>A turnpike is not "otherwise known as a toll road". A turnpike is a <b>specific type</b> (or specific naming style) of toll road. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 12:12, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, let's split that apart into its separate meanings:</dd>
<dd>"A toll road is a road on which a toll authority collects a fee for use."</dd>
<dd>"A turnpike is a road on which a toll authority collects a fee for use."</dd>
<dd>"A tollpike is a road on which a toll authority collects a fee for use."</dd>
<dd>This does not mean that any toll road is a turnpike, or that any turnpike is a toll road (though the latter is generally true, because "A toll road is a road on which a toll authority collects a fee for use." is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28logic%29.html" title="Tautology (logic)">tautology</a> in structure.</dd>
<dd>If this confuses you, just think about my original argument, without getting into the text on the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toll_road.html" title="Toll road">toll road</a> page. <b>All those bridges and tunnels are roads, and are thus toll roads.</b> --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> 12:18, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thing - since we already have several "toll roads in X" categories, it seems that the same should be done for bridges and tunnels. Then "toll bridges in X" can go in "bridges in X" and "toll bridges".</p>

<p>there is a need to represent REAL dublin and irish people at the site, together or without links to special population groups. options at faceparty are "prefer not say", "any" or otherwise.<br />

it's an improvement as far as i can see. i do not know, probably the entry should sound: see REAL irish people. the participation to the service is not obligatory.<br />
<br />
sometimes disadvantaged groups are getting rights, then soon they are the only people with rights. normal people do not exist or what?<br />
<br />

<p>Hey frank, I was wondering if you would not mind looking at a massive page edit i am doing and give me some feedback. It's at Detroit, Michigan/Temp, i don't know how much you know about Detroit, being from the Netherlands and all, but just some general comments and thoughts would be nice, if you have the chance.

<dd>Yeah, as you guessed, my ability to help on the content side of things is rather limited. Highlighting differences is tricky when using a separate temp subpage; I personally prefer making even the large sweeping changes in-place, with the inuse tag; it makes it easier to use the diff functions and keep some changes and revert others. Still, opinions differ strongly on this, so if you prefer this way of doing things, by all means keep doing so.
<ul>
<li>I noticed you dropped the link to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Detroit%2C_Michigan_8a2c.html" title="History of Detroit, Michigan">History of Detroit, Michigan</a> article. Was this on purpose? I don't think the main article covers everything in the history article, nor am I sure it should.</li>
<li>If you feel like putting in the effort, some of the demographic data in the article might be more accessible if put in tables or graphs.</li>
<li>Colleges and universities is just a list instead of prose. Is there anything to be said about Detroit colleges and universities in general, so you can make a small introduction text followed by a short <i>list of colleges and universities</i>?</li>
<li>The transport section could use some fleshing out in text I think, perhaps some general blather about it being a transport hub, and what this means for the city?</li>
<li>I'm not sure I like having that list of people there. That they're from Detroit says something about those people, but not so much about the city Detroit. Unless you want to posit that Detroit produces a disproportionate number of famous people, I think just linking to <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_from_Detroit_d7a6.html" title="People from Detroit">People from Detroit</a> in the <i>See also</i> would be enough. (Also, generally these lists are an annoyance to maintain. Everyone wants to put "their" celebrity on them, even if they're not major enough to be listed in a shortlist.)</li>
<li>Same goes for the sister cities as for the Universities really, could you say something about detroits relationship and how they came to be?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>A lot of these are matters of taste of course, so feel free to ignore any you disagree with.

<p>Boothy: While I'm not familiar with Detroit or with the article, generally, I like it, especially your management of the long and unattractive lists. I especially like what you did with the history section. My only comment from a cursory examination is that the list of movies is formatted rather oddly (for Wikipedia, film year is usually given in parentheses and actor's names aren't italicized).

<p>All in all, a nice article. Comments and thoughts: 1. Under transportation, "an extensive, if not erratic, bus service throughout the City, and very near suburbs".&#160;??? 2. What about Amtrak service? 3. Detroit has become something of common noun used to refer to the US auto industry, even through all the manufacturers have actually left the city itself (I think). 4.

<p>No worries. I think the work you did on <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> is great; the article flows a lot better now. Sure there's a lot of cleaning up going on now that your edit is in place, but maybe that's because your reworked article has created new interest. Don't let your detractors get you down; some people like to talk on talk pages, you and me like to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a>. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz">foobaz</a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz">✐</a> 20:17, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not any newfound "interest" that's driving the cleaning up; the Detroit page has always garnered reliable attention. (A quick glance at the history page will back that up.) The cleaning up is happening simply because there was suddenly a lot of cleaning up to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's nothing wrong with being bold. I myself was <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">beholden to boldness</a> back when I did a major overhaul of the Detroit article several months ago. So the issue here was not "boldness" but rather -- as pointed out on the discussion page -- the typos, errors and stilted syntax introduced by this latest revision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's a difference between boldness and recklessness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said... I and others have acknowledged the benefits of the latest restructuring. In fact, I've just finished my editing work, and we've now got a nice little piece sitting there -- an improved article that I think most folks will be happy with.</dd>
