<p>The page claimed that Job is called Jobab in the LXX version of Genesis 36:33. The first problem is this person is called Jobab in all versions I looked at including the Hebrew. The next problem is how do we know it meant Job if all the versions say Jobab?

<p>I think, like Axel above, that the assertion that "Job was a historical person" is suspect at best. I know of no evidence for his existence - I have no idea on what basis it could ever have been asserted as true. If anyone knows of such evidence, please reinsert it. THe Anchor Bible commentary says that the idea that it represents "sober history" is a "naïve view", and that Rabbi Simeon-ben-Laquis said Job never existed (Midrash Rabba Gen lxvii; Talmud Babli, Bab Bathra 15a). -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> (more on theodicy &amp; Job once I dig out Jung's "Answer to Job"....Muahaha!)</p>

<i>Most Christian believe that Job was a real historical figure</i> - I guess this is limited to orthodox protestant and catholic christians.

<p>It isn't really fair to say that "protestant, catholic, and orthdox christians" all feel Job was a historical individual. Notably, C.S. Lewis assumed Job was a fictional character (see his "Reflections on the Psalms"), while many critics from many different backgrounds have discussed the narrative feel, the ahistorical nature, and the literary form of the book as reasons to suppose it does not reflect a historical individual. Of course, this is not to say that there wasn't a backlog story or a kind of historical instance that turned into a story of this kind.</p>

<p><i>in the introductory section God decides to inflict misery on Job and his family as a result of a bet with Satan</i> - This isn't strictly true, God does not directly inflict misery on Job and his family, he merely allows Satan to do so in order to disprove Satan's accusation that Job only fears God and abstains from evil because God has blessed him materially. In other words, Job is only a selfish person following the path of least resistance. --<a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnow_b0fc.html" title="User:Jsnow">Jsnow</a> 20:34, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess its a little late, but God does not initially inflict misery upon Job, but when his remaining family went to comfort him " ...they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him;..." (42:11, NRSV) Which, to me, seems to indicate that God was in fact inflicting some evil. However this could also be explained as the family’s viewpoint, which, to some degree, does keep the hands of God clean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, should we include more interpretations of theodicy derived from this book? Such as the idea that the normal "Why do bad things happen to good people?" question is not what this book is trying to address. What some argue the book is trying to address is “Will humans continue to be believe in God even without a carrot/stick reward/punishment causality?”</dd>

<p>I've removed the "genuines" (check my recent edit), because though there is a basic text, and there are some additions, framing, interpolations, counter-interpretations, etc in the version we have, no one means to suggest that any of it is in some way "not genuine". I think everyone who reads <i>Job</i> agrees with that. So I changed "genuine" text to "base text."

<p>I was taught that one of the unusual things about the language in the Book of Job (and part of what makes it so difficult) is that it tends to use 'legal' language; the word used for the Adversary, for instance, literally means prosecuting attorney, while God says to Job "He who <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arraignment.html" title="Arraignment">arraigns</a> God must respond", using the Hebrew equivilent of the legal term. Is this true? If so, should it be mentioned somewhere in the article? Some parts touch on it, such as the bit about the Adversary at the end, but perhaps the issue of language should be addressed more specifically. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 19:49, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The book of Job is referenced in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartmanland.html" title="Cartmanland">Cartmanland</a> It would seem immaterial the number of days Job suffered. The fact that God allowed Satan to cause many innocent people and hundreds of animals to die to win a 'bet' seems preposterous.

<p>The death of his children, with God's blessing, seemed unnessary to find out if he would reject his faith in the Almighty.</p>

<p>לדעת הרמב"ן ספר איוב מרמז לרעיון גלגול הנשמות שהוא הפיתרון האמיתי לבעיית השכר והעונש. אחרים הדגישו רמיזות לעולם הבא, אם כי הוא אינו מוזכר בשום מקום בספר בצורה מפורשת, ואיוב אף דוחה את הרעיון שיש תקווה לאדם לאחר מותו (בפרק יד, יא-יב למשל: "אָזְלוּ-מַיִם, מִנִּי-יָם; וְנָהָר, יֶחֱרַב וְיָבֵשׁ. וְאִישׁ שָׁכַב - וְלֹא-יָקוּם.")</p>

<dd>If God is omnipotent, (s)he can be much more silly than you. The Book of Job is a true fable. Some may think it deals with the problems between man and God, between Good and Evil ... just read it along and see the beauty of the story&#160;:</dd>

<p>I'd like to give this article more detail, his friends Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar speeches can be summarized in this way:</p>
<p>Eliphaz's speech <i>You're suffering now because you are sinful</i> (Job 4-5) Eliphaz basically asks Have you ever known a truly good and innocent person who was punished by God? (4:7-8)</p>
<p>Bildad's speech <i>You're still suffering because you won't admit your guilt</i> (Job 8) Bildad reacted strongly to Job's claim of innocence. He demanded to know if Job thought that God perverted judgement. (8:3) Bildad also assumed that Job's children had sinned and deserved to die (8:4) and that Job too had sinned and therefore deserved his sufferings. He urged Job to seek forgiveness to be restored to God and to blessing. Bildad cites history and the advice of past generations (8:8-10) to support his theory that Job had forgotten God (8:13-14). Bildad concludes that God is always fair, and people get exactly what they deserved in the end (8:20-22). So if Job suffered, it was obvious to Bildad that Job desered to suffer.</p>
<p>Zophar's speech <i>Job's sin deserves even more suffering than he's now experiencing</i> (Job 11:1-20) Zophar thought Job shouldn't get away with his claim of innocence (11:1-3). He said it was likely that Job truly believed he was innocent (11:4), but that didn't make him so. Zophar invites God to speak in the hopes that God will show Job just how sinful he is. Zophar concludes by telling Job to repent of his sins (11:14).</p>

<p>Many Christians with a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationist.html" title="Creationist">creationist</a> viewpoint believe that the book of Job is one of the earliest books of the Bible ever written for the apparent account of unknown large animals that are possibly <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaurs.html" title="Dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> like we see in the <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_record.html" title="Fossil record">fossil record</a>. This presupposes a <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_earth.html" title="Young earth">young earth</a> form of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a></p>
<p>The passages of Job that are commonly cited are:</p>
<p>(Job 40:15-19) (KJV) <i>Behold now <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behemoth.html" title="Behemoth">behemoth</a>, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</i></p>
<p>(Job 41:1-8) (KJV) <i>Canst thou draw out <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviathan.html" title="Leviathan">leviathan</a> with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</i></p>
<p>(Job 41:14-33) (KJV) <i>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. <b>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</b> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</i></p>

<p>I fully agree with what this section of the book of Job says. Through the language and wording used, it is obvious to me that dinosaurs were being referred to.

<p>This article currently puts all its sources at the bottom.

<p>Although the concept of Satan as the devil developed later in biblical history, these associations were not existing at the time Job was written.

<p>The point of Job is to show the relationship between God, as the almighty and omnipotent creator of the universe and mankind.</p>
<p>Key Verses:</p>
<p>38:1: Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2: Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 38:3: Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
<p>Mankind must have an understanding of that which is spoken. Knowledge is the key.</p>
<p>38:18: Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p>Mankind has now perceived the breadth of the earth, but does not know it all.</p>
<p>38:33: Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
<p>The ordinances of heaven are now partially understood and partial understanding of how they apply to earth are known.</p>
<p>38:35: Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</p>
<p>Indeed we do.</p>
<p>All through the LORD’s litany are examples of knowledge which was unknown in Job’s time. Many such examples are now explicable. This is mankind’s purpose, to gain knowledge and understanding, and not leave salvation to God. Mankind’s purpose is to gain the understanding necessary to do all things. And then:</p>
<p>40:14: Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</p>

<p>"Talmudic tradition maintains that the Book of Job was written by Moses, although the Sages dispute whether it was based on historical reality or intended as a parable. Although Moses' authorship is accepted as definitive[citation needed], other opinions in the Talmud ascribe it to the period of the First Temple.
