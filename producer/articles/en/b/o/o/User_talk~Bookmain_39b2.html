<p>Just so we know who we are dealing with:</p>

<p>Here is Aaron's message to the group (dated 15th Dec):</p>

<p>Morons have polluting the Wikipedia page, trying to link NLP to Dianetics and Scientology, because obviously enneagrams = engrams....(even though nobody in NLP uses the term engram, other than some fringe loser author who absolutely nobody references except for these cranks -- who, it seems, have some financial and/or professional-status motivation to slander the NLP community.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming#Engrams_-_enneagr" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming#Engrams_-_enneagr" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming#Engrams_-_enneagr</a>\ ams</p>
<p>It's time to bring some people more knowledgeable than myself into this.</p>
<p>Plus, 10 people can pick apart the arguments of these cranks better than one.</p>
<p>Aaron</p>
<hr />
<p>According to the NLP article history, Metta Bubble, DejaKitty, and Blauregen joined soon after the message was sent. There were also some anonymous IPs that also joined in the fact deletions and advocacy thereof.</p>
<p>I'm sure Wikipedia has nothing against someone's belief in remote influence, Kahuna sect, or Ha Prayer Rituals, and of course it is a free world mostly and one should not be banned or persecuted for remote viewing, telepathic hypnosis, or pyramid energy development as they wish. However, that background may cause a slight bias towards pseudoscientific thinking.</p>
<p>I will post the appropriate meatpuppet messages.</p>

<dd>Hiya Bookmain. I've moved your chat here. I joined before akulki ever wrote that gobbledegook. I would appreciate an apology if you ever change your mind. You could view my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Metta_Bubble_3803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Metta Bubble">edit history</a> and notice that I joined well before the date of your suspected recruitment campaign and that I contribute to a much broader section of wikipedia than most of the people editing the NLP article. I apologise for not holding the same views as you, it's perhaps a cause of some distress, but it doesn't make me a meatpuppet. Have you considered the possibility that the opinions I and others hold are actually common opinions? Perhaps it's these kind of baseless personal attacks and revert warring that is keeping more people like me from contributing to what could be a fantastic article. Best wishes and Peace. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetta_Bubble_dc7b.html" title="User:Metta Bubble">Metta Bubble</a> 04:38, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No Comaze. I've scant time as it is, and I feel there are too many distractions from improvement to the NLP page already. Though I wouldn't go as far to say that sort of distraction was a form of trolling, I certainly believe the article could be far more focused towards improvement. Especially regarding cleanup. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookmain_4ad3.html" title="User:Bookmain">Bookmain</a> 06:34, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Today you made this post:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Dilts talks of the unconscious as a precious resouce. He says that it relates to the shamanic concept of the nagual. NLP assumes that all excellent people have a strong relationship between the zonal and the nagual. These shamanic concepts could be presented in the neuro section. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookmain_4ad3.html" title="User:Bookmain">Bookmain</a> 05:55, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Perhaps I should clarify my bias. I don't believe NLPers are crackpots. If Dilts, Grinder and Bandler want to mix unverified neuroscience with the shamanic notions of the zonal and nagual, or with mind and spirit, that is fine by me. But some experts will want to say it is new age neurobabble or occult banality (Beyerstein and others). Bookmain 05:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The above posts brings you very close in line with a group of banned proven sockpuppets (DaveRight, JPLogan, Camridge, etc.). Are you able to explain this? I have strong evidence to prove this. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">-=-C-=-</a> 06:22, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes I am able to explain it. The arguments are written clearly in the literature, and prior users banned for being alleged sockpuppets have also used similar arguments based on the literature. However, if by your inferrence, anyone using lines from the more independent literature is a sockpuppet, then the only people left to edit the article will be the ones who do not use independent literature (bad editors). Basically, if you think I'm a sockpuppet, go ahead and prove it. As it happens, I am actually in touch with some prior alleged sockpuppets (at least, they have different email addresses), and they still helpfully offer me new research on NLP. If I am blocked or banned for being a sockpuppet (unlikely, as my office is my own) I will still be able to contribute to the article through other well meaning editors. As it is, I believe the only reason you go round accusing all non-advocates of sockpuppetry is for ulterior motives and this is in line with your persistently science-dismissing arguments and actions over the past year. Remember, you have already been told not to do this by other mediators. Your every move is being recorded.

<dd>I'd rather communicate with you first to check with you. Based on your editing patterns, I'm almost certain that you are one of the banned editors. If not, you have openly stated that you are working with the banned editors (JPLogan, DaveRight, Camridge). Either way, I don't think its acceptable under wikipedia guidelines and policy to work with banned editors. Should we take this back to arbcom, since the mentorship seems to of all but failed. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">-=-C-=-</a> 10:06, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's a good question. You might want to join the Wikipedia-EN mailing list. <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMailing_lists_886e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mailing lists">Wikipedia:Mailing_lists</a> has the information. It's towards the bottom of the page. They often have conversations about privacy and how to protect it. Other than that, not really alot out there. It's difficult when we have people like Brandt out there who seem to like to "out" people. It's sad with kate in particular because she is one of our best (if not the best) admin. She's always extremely civil, helpful, etc. Anyway. you might want to leave a note on <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo's</a> talk page as well.

<dd>Just some general things too. This might seem common sense, but sometimes people miss these things. If you are accessible by email, remember that others cannot see your address to you respond to them if they are using the "Email this user" link. Also, in the email you are using for Wikipedia, don't put your name in. Or don't mention where you are from. Again, this seems like minor stuff but it isn't. It took me forever to figure that out myself until I ran into someone who looked up my name, where I work, etc. It can be scary stuff. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 09:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Woohookitty. I'll apply the email safety option myself. We've all been communicating through Headley behind the scenes but a well meaning but careless editor managed to pass my work email on to a "concerned" party, and I have even had a letter posted to my office making legal sounding threats. I know its all bluff and bluster, but it would be nice if editors had a clear set of international and local law recommendations for protection. At least some of these laws have real bite, and thats enough to give editors some protection, and to give them a shield to help them edit both responsibly and confidently. I'll do some more research on this and have a search of the newsgroup. We all have the option to opt out and thats a good thing, but it shouldn't be because we feel threatened and powerless. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookmain_4ad3.html" title="User:Bookmain">Bookmain</a> 11:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice to see the NLPers doing what you would expect. How about encouraging them to celebrate the exit of Kate, Woohookitty? Clearly she failed (according to Comaze). My wife spent 4 hours last night looking up case and international law on privacy and protection. We both together came up with some actionable international law on privacy protection ordinance, data protection, malicious prosecution, and others. In all, it comes to over 2 large files of information. Depending on how much Jimbo is willing to kiss my arse, I may consider handing him the info. But then again, I bet he doesn't give a toss. I mean, how much was he willing to protect Kate (or any other editor) in the first place? Anyway, carry on with the partying. See how easy it will be to clarify the NLP bs now!
