<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Edit section: Narrative">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Narrative</span></h2>
<p>In chapter one, Job, living in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Land_of_Uz_1f1e.html" title="The Land of Uz">The Land of Uz</a>, is described as a man of great probity, virtue, and piety. He possesses much livestock and many servants. He has seven sons and three daughters and is respected by all people on both sides of the Euphrates. After his sons have a feast, Job purifies them and offers burnt sacrifices so that God may pardon any faults the boys may have committed during the festivities. This attests to Job's righteousness.</p>
<p>God permits "the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>" to put the virtue of Job to the test, at first by giving him power over his property, but forbidding him to touch his person. Satan began by taking away all of Job's riches, his livestock, his house, his servants, and his children; a series of messengers informs him that they have perished in various disasters.</p>
<p>Job rends his clothes, shaves his head, and falls down upon the ground saying, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked shall I return there. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Job endures these calamities without reproaching Divine Providence, the Satan solicits permission to afflict his person as well, and God says, "Behold he is in your hand, but don’t touch his life." Satan, therefore, smites him with dreadful <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boils.html" title="Boils">boils</a>, and Job, seated in ashes, scrapes off the corruption with a pot shard. His wife wants him to "curse God, and die" but Job answers "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"</p>
<p>In the meantime, only three of Job's friends come to visit him in his misfortune - Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the <a href="../../../n/a/a/Naamathite.html" title="Naamathite">Naamathite</a>. A fourth, Elihu the Buzite, first begins talking in chapter 32 and bears a distinguished part in the dialogue; his arrival is not explained. The friends spend a week sitting on the ground with Job, without speaking, until Job at last breaks his silence and complains of his misery.</p>

<p>Job's three friends do not waver from their belief that God is right, and that anyone who has such poor fortune as Job is necessarily being punished for disobeying God's law. As the poem progresses Job's friends increasingly berate him for refusing to confess his sins, although they themselves are at a loss as to what sort of sins he has committed. The three friends continue to assume that Job was a sinner and therefore deserves all punishments. They also assume, in their simplistic theology, that God always rewards good and punishes evil, with no apparent exceptions allowed. There seems to be no room in their understanding of God for divine discretion and mystery in allowing and arranging suffering for purposes other than retribution.</p>

<p>Job, convinced of his own innocence, maintains that his suffering cannot be accounted for by his few sins, and that there is no reason for God to punish him thus. However, he refuses to curse God's name.</p>

<p>Elihu, whose name means '<b>My God is He'</b>, takes a mediator's path, maintaining the sovereignty and righteousness and gracious mercy of God. Elihu strongly condemns the approach taken by the three friends, and argues that Job is misrepresenting God's righteousness and discrediting His loving character. Elihu says he spoke last because he is much younger than the other three friends, but says that age makes no difference when it comes to insights and wisdom. In his speech, Elihu argues for God's power, redemptive salvation and absolute rightness in all His conduct. God is mighty, yet just, and quick to warn and to forgive. Elihu takes a distinct view of the kind of repentance required by Job. Job's three friends claim that repentance requires Job to identify and renounce the sins that gave rise to his suffering. By contrast, Elihu stresses that repentance inextricably entails renouncing any moral authority or cosmological perspective, which is God's alone. Elihu therefore underscores the inherent arrogance in Job's desire to 'make his case' before God, which presupposes that Job possesses a superior moral standard that can be prevailed upon God. Apparently, Elihu acts in a prophetic role preparatory to the appearance of God. At the end of the narrative, God rebukes Job's three friends but does not rebuke Elihu. Job never replies to Elihu's indictments and revelations of God's dealings with him through the ordeal.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Edit section: God's response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">God's response</span></h3>
<p>After several rounds of debate between Job and his friends, in a divine voice, described as coming from a "cloud" or "whirlwind", God describes, in evocative and lyrical language, what the experience of being responsible for the world is like, and asks if Job has ever had the experiences that He (God) has had.</p>
<p>God's answer underscores that Job shares the world with numerous powerful and remarkable creatures, creatures with lives and needs of their own, whom God must provide for, and the young of some hunger in a way that can only be satisfied by taking the lives of others. Does Job even have any experience of the world he lives in? Does he understand what it means to be responsible for such a world? Job admits that he does not.</p>
<p>God's speech also emphasizes his sovereignty in creating and maintaining the world. The thrust is not merely that God has experiences that Job does not, but also that God is King over the world and is not necessarily subject to questions from his creatures, including men. He declines to answer any of Job's questions or challenges with anything except "I am the Lord." Job asks God for forgiveness.</p>
<p>In the epilogue, God condemns Job's friends for their insistence on speaking wrongly of God's motives and methods, commands them to make extensive animal sacrifices and instructs Job to pray for their forgiveness. Immediately thereafter God restores Job to health, giving him double the riches he before possessed (including ten new children added to the ten who predeceased him). His daughters are the most beautiful in the land, and are given inheritance while Job is still alive. Job is crowned with a holy life and with a happy death.</p>

<p>The term "the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>" appears in the prose prologue of <i>Job</i>, with his usual connotation of "the adversary," as a distinct being. He is shown as one of the celestial beings or "sons of God" before the Deity, replying to the inquiry of God as to whence he had come, with the words: "from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it" (<i>Job</i> 1:7). Both the question and the answer, as well as the dialogue that ensues, characterize Satan as that member of the divine council who watches over human activity, but with the evil purpose of searching out men's sins and appearing as their accuser. He is, as it were, a celestial "prosecutor," who sees only iniquity; for he persists in his evil opinion of Job even after the man of Uz has passed successfully through his first trial by surrendering to the will of God, whereupon Satan demands another test through physical suffering (<i>Job</i> 2:3-5). Satan challenges God by saying that Job's belief is only built upon what material goods he is given, and that his faith will disappear as soon as they are taken from him. And God accepts the challenge.</p>
<p>Another theory holds that the "satan" of Job is a corruption of the Farsi term for an interlocutor or prosecutor.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since December 2006" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The introduction of "the adversary" occurs in the (very short) framing story alone: he is never alluded to in the (very long) central poem at all.</p>
<p>While many, from a Christian perspective, believe Satan to be the Devil, in the Book of Job he is presented as a worker for God known as the "the satan" (ha-satan, 'the adversary'), not Satan as a personal name. He is the ultimate prosecutor for God.</p>

<p>In contrast, secular examinations of the text more generally conclude that, though archaic features such as the "council in heaven" survive, and though the story of Job was familiar to Ezekiel (Chapter 14 verse 14), the present form of <i>Job</i> was fixed in the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century_BC_4d91.html" title="4th century BC">4th century BC</a>. Ezekiel places Job in comparison with other righteous figures such as Noah and "Dan-el".

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Edit section: Later interpolations and additions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later interpolations and additions</span></h3>
<p>In the edited form of <i>Job</i> that we have, various interpolations have been claimed to have been made in the text of the central poem. The most common such claims are of two kinds: the "parallel texts", which are parallel developments of the corresponding passages in the base text, and the speeches of Elihu (Chapters 32-37), which consist of a polemic against the ideas expressed elsewhere in the poem, and so are claimed to be interpretive interpolations. The speeches of Elihu (who, along with the 3 friends, is not mentioned in the prologue) are claimed to contradict the fundamental opinions expressed by the 'friendly accusers' in the central body of the poem, according to which it is impossible that the righteous should suffer, all pain being a punishment for some sin. Elihu, however, reveals that suffering may be decreed for the righteous as a protection against greater sin, for moral betterment and warning, and to elicit greater trust and dependence on a merciful, compassionate God in the midst of adversity, a theme common throughout the Old and New Testaments culminating in the person of Messiah as the Suffering Servant.</p>
<p>Subjects of more contention among scholars are the identity of claimed corrections and revisions of Job's speeches, which are claimed to have been made for the purpose of harmonizing them with the orthodox doctrine of retribution. A prime example of such a claim is the translation of the last line Job speaks (42:6), which is extremely problematic in the Hebrew. Traditional translations have him say, "Therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes." This is consonant with the central body of the poem and Job's speeches, other mortal encounters with the divine in the Bible (Isaiah in Chapter 6, for example), and the fact that there would have been no restoration without Job's humble repentant acknowledgement of mortality faced with divinity in all its majesty and glory.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Edit section: Exegesis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exegesis</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">Exegesis</a> largely concerns the question, "Is misfortune always a divine punishment for something?" Job's three friends argued in the affirmative, stating that Job's misfortunes were proof that he had committed some sins for which he was being punished. His friends also advanced the converse position that good fortune is always a divine reward, and that if Job would renounce his supposed sins, he would immediately experience the return of good fortune.</p>
<p>In response, Job asserted that he was a righteous man, and that his misfortune was therefore not a punishment for anything. This raised the possibility that God acts in capricious ways, and Job's wife urged him to curse God, and die. Instead, Job responded with equanimity: "The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away; blessed be the name of the Lord." The climax of the book occurs when God responds to Job, not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when God created the world?</p>
<p>God's response itself may be read in a variety of ways. Some see it as an attempt to humble Job. Yet Job is comforted by God's appearance, and the fact that he 'saw God and lived', suggesting that the author of the book was more concerned with whether or not God is present in people's lives, than with the question of whether or not God is just. <i>Job</i> chapter 28 rejects these efforts to fathom divine wisdom.</p>
<p>The framing story complicates the book further: in the introductory section God, during a conversation with Satan, allows Satan to inflict misery on Job and his family. The appended conclusion has God restoring Job to wealth, granting him new children, and possibly restoring his health, although this is more implied than explicitly stated. This may suggest that the faith of the perfect believer is rewarded. However, God speaks directly to this question, condemns Job's friends, and says that Job is the only man who has faithfully represented the true nature of God - that all his friends were wrong to say that faith and righteousness are rewarded. Only after Job's friends make a sacrifice to God and are prayed for by afflicted Job - as God's appointed priest - does God restore all Job's good fortune.</p>

<p>The Testament of Job, a book found in the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigrapha.html" title="Pseudepigrapha">Pseudepigrapha</a>, has a parallel account to the narrative to the book of Job. There are legendary details such as the fate of Job's wife, the inheritance of Job's daughters, and the ancestry of Job.</p>
<p>In folktale manner in the style of Jewish <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haggada.html" title="Haggada">haggada</a> <a href="http://www.library.uu.nl/digiarchief/dip/diss/2004-0205-103455/c3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.uu.nl/digiarchief/dip/diss/2004-0205-103455/c3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, it elaborates upon the <i>Book of Job</i> making Job a king in Egypt. Like many other <i>Testament of ...</i> works in the Old Testament apocrypha, it gives the narrative a framing-tale of Job's last illness, in which he calls together his sons and daughters to give them his final instructions and exhortations. The <i>Testament of Job</i> contains all the characters familiar in the <i>Book of Job</i>, with a more prominent role for Job's wife, given the name <i>Sitidos</i>, and many parallels to Christian beliefs that Christian readers find, such as intercession with God and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Unlike the Biblical Book of Job, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>'s vindictiveness towards Job is described in the Testament as being due to Job destroying a non-Jewish temple, indeed <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> is described in a far more villainous light, than simply being a <i>prosecuting counsel</i>. Job is equally portrayed differently; Satan is shown to directly attack Job, but fails each time due to Job's willingness to be patient, unlike the Biblical narrative where Job falls victim but retains faith.</p>
<p>The latter section of the work, dedicated like the Biblical text to Job's comforters, deviates even further from the Biblical narrative. Rather than complaining or challenging God, Job consistently asserts his faith despite the laments of his comforters. While one of the comforters gives up, and the others try to get him medical treatment, Job insists his faith is true, and eventually the voice of God tells the comforters to stop their behavior. When most of the comforters choose to listen to God's voice, they decide to taunt the one remaining individual who still laments Job's fate.</p>

<p>The Talmud occasionally discusses Job. Classical <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> scholarship has not doubted Job's existence. He was seen as a real and powerful figure. Some scholars of <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> maintain that Job was in fact one of three advisors that <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> consulted, prior to taking action against the increasingly multiplying "Children of Israel" mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Exodus_bed1.html" title="Book of Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> during the time of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>' birth.

It is for his silence that God subsequently punishes him with his bitter afflictions. <a href="http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/pesach/5755/vol1no10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/pesach/5755/vol1no10.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

In this view, Job was a literary creation by a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a> who used this form of writing to convey a divine message or parable. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> (in Tractate Baba Batra 15a-16b) goes to great lengths trying to ascertain when Job actually lived, citing many opinions and interpretations by the leading <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wise_Old_Man_f0d1.html" title="Wise Old Man">sages</a>. Job is further mentioned in the Talmud as follows <a href="http://www.aishdas.org/webshas/torah/bichtav/tanach/iyyov.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aishdas.org/webshas/torah/bichtav/tanach/iyyov.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>:</p>

<p>One midrashic view is that Job was the Pharaoh of Egypt during the time of Moses. Therefore there would be a justification for why Job was punished.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Edit section: Philosophical approach">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical approach</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, a twelfth century rabbi, discusses Job in his work <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guide_for_the_Perplexed_4ac7.html" title="Guide for the Perplexed">Guide for the Perplexed</a>. According to Maimonides (chs. 22-23), each of Job's friends represents famous, distinct schools of thought concerning God and divine providence.</p>
<p>Bildad, for example, portrays the standard Jewish view, as well as the Islamic <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a> view, that righteousness is rewarded by God (Job 8:6-8), although one may have to be patient for the reward to come. Therefore, if Job is righteous, as he claims to be, God will reward him eventually.</p>
<p>Moreover, Job reflects the view of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, that God destroys the innocent and the wicked together (Job 9). If Job held this point of view, then he did not believe in divine providence, even if he did believe in God's existence.</p>
<p>According to Maimonides, the correct view of providence lies with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elihu.html" title="Elihu">Elihu</a>, who teaches Job that one must examine his/her religion (Job 33). This view corresponds with the notion that "the only worthy religion in the world is an examined religion." A habit religion, such as that originally practiced by Job, is never enough. One has to look deep into the meaning of religion in order to fully appreciate it and make it a genuine part of one's life. Elihu believed in the concepts of divine providence, rewards to individuals, as well as punishments. He believed, according to Maimonides, that one has to practice religion in a rational way. The more one investigates religion, the more he/she will be rewarded or find it rewarding. In the beginning, Job was an unexamining, pious man, not a philosopher, and he didn't have providence. He was unwise, simply grateful for what he had. God, according to Elihu, did not single out Job for punishment, but rather abandoned him and let him be dealt with by natural, unfriendly forces.</p>
<p>Conversely, in more recent times, Russian existentialist philosopher <a href="../../../l/e/v/Lev_Shestov_ab0e.html" title="Lev Shestov">Lev Shestov</a> viewed Job as the embodiment of the battle between reason (which offers general and seemingly comforting explanations for complex events) and faith in a personal god, and one man's desperate cry for him. In fact, Shestov used the story of Job as a central signifier for his core philosophy (the vast critique of the history of Western philosophy, which he saw broadly as a monumental battle between Reason and Faith, Athens and Jerusalem, secular and religious outlook):</p>
<p>"The whole book is one uninterrupted contest between the 'cries' of the much-afflicted Job and the 'reflections' of his rational friends. The friends, as true thinkers, look not at Job but at the 'general.' Job, however, does not wish to hear about the 'general'; he knows that the general is deaf and dumb - and that it is impossible to speak with it. 'But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God' (13:3). The friends are horrified at Job's words: they are convinced that it is not possible to speak with God and that the Almighty is concerned about the firmness of His power and the unchangeability of His laws but not about the fate of the people created by Him. Perhaps they are convinced that in general God does not know any concerns but that He only rules. That is why they answer, 'You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you or the rock be removed from its place?' (18:4). And, indeed, shall rocks really be removed from their place for the sake of Job? And shall necessity renounce its sacred rights? This would truly be the summit of human audacity, this would truly be a 'mutiny,' a 'revolt' of the single human personality against the eternal laws of the all-unity of being!" (Speculation and Apocalypse).</p>

<p><a href="../../../n/a/c/Nachmanides.html" title="Nachmanides">Nachmanides</a> offers a mystical commentary on the Book of Job. According to the mystical approach, Job is being punished because he is a heretic. One reason why Job can be seen as a heretic is because in Chapter 3, he automatically assumed and was convinced that he did not sin and God therefore has no right to punish him. Another reason why Job can be viewed as a heretic is because he did not believe in reincarnation. He believes that once a person dies, it is all over for him/her, without any mention of an afterlife.</p>
<p>According to Job, who reflected the views of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, God gave the world over to astrology. This is evident in Job's lamentation, "Curse the day I was born on" (3:2) Job cursed his birthday because he believed that his birthday was bad luck, in the astrological sense.</p>
<p>According to Nachmanides, Job's children did not die in the beginning of the story, but rather were taken captive and then return from captivity by the end of the story.</p>

<p>According to commentator Jonathan Schraub, the subject is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature, endurance, and issue. It consists of A historical introduction in prose (ch. 1,2).</p>
<ol>
<li>The controversy and its solution, in poetry (ch. 3-42:6). Job's desponding lamentation (ch. 3) is the occasion of the controversy which is carried on in three courses of dialogues between Job and his three friends. The first course gives the commencement of the controversy (ch. 4-14); the second the growth of the controversy (15-21); and the third the height of the controversy (22-27). Job puts God on trial through an "Oath of Innocence" (Job 27-31). This is followed by a resolution of the controversy in the refreshingly original concepts incorporated in the speeches of Elihu preparing the way for the address of God. Accounts split after this. The normative conception holds that Job humbly confesses (42:1-6) his own fault and folly. Job's repentance is pivotal to the story as being the ultimate purpose for the entire ordeal, with restoration by God's great mercy and compassion being the crowning climax. An alternative interpretation concludes just the opposite: Job refuses to repent or acknowledge his error, holding God accountable for His injustice and standing in radical countertestimony to the normative belief in an omnibenevolent God. The former account is more popularly held, but the latter has the advantage of being in accord with the original Hebrew. The book may possibly have been written by multiple authors.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
