<p>I'm new to Wikipedia, and have been learning as much as I can on how to edit/create articles. I'd really like to join your bootcamp, but I'm absolutely IRC illiterate at the moment, having installed it just now for the sake of joining your classes. When midnight finally rolled around, I was heavily disappointed about my inability to connect to the bootcamp channel. Could you, or anyone else reading this, help me out and tell me what I did wrong? I followed the instructions you gave as closely as I could, but I think I was a minute late (IRC trouble). Was that why I couldn't connect? I'd appreciate any help. Pasta Salad 05:11, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Topics expected</span></h2>
<p>Hi, your bootcamp is a neat idea. The tonight talk on Template is very suggestive. I think this camp is helpful not only for newbies but also for us old-bies (if I can be counted as such).</p>
<p>My suggestions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to do adventure a maze of Wikipedia documents: VP, VfD and other request pages, Special pages ...</li>
<li>How do I tune my preferences? (fansy signature, RC expansion and so on)</li>
<li>Other projects speicially Wikisource, Commons and meta.</li>
<li>Wikipedia related contents: Signpost, Wikimedia Quarto ...</li>
<li>What is a stub and substub ; how can I avoid creating <i>wiktionary candidate</i>s ;-)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>I think this is a nifty idea, but I'd prefer a different name. For one thing, boot camps are not known for being friendly places. Maybe "Wikipedia 101" would be better. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 16:57, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Encyclopedic content is of value when it is objective. In many ways, the average wikipedian is in need of discipline to maintain sight of the objective. I know I am. Imposing rules upon myself is easier if i keep them strict. I expect my peers to honor that and hold me to it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boot Camp times</span></h2>
<p>I think this is a good idea, especially since the whole Wiki creating and editing isn't a user-friendly at first as it seems. I strongly support the orientation or however you want to call it, and I very much would like to attend one of them. However, midnight EST is 5:00am GMT, which is my time zone, and as much as I enjoy Wiki, I am not really keen on waking up/staying up at 5 o'clock in the morning! Any chance there could be an alternate time frame for this? If night are what works for you, what about mornings? 7:00am EST is noon GMT! Well, just hope something can be done. Thanks!</p>

<dd>Hmm. noon GMT is 9:00pm JST. It seems better for me but I'm afraid many Wikipedians in EST zone are sleeping in this hour.</dd>
<dd>Or we can an orientation twice a day? At least on weekend? --<a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" title="User:Aphaia"><font color="midnightblue">Aphaea</font></a><font color="gold">*</font> 08:38, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about two different bootcamp times, hosted by different people? Midnight EST is easy for me since I'm always at a computer then, and on IRC. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Still happening?</span></h2>
<p>Is this still going on? All my welcome messages since February have contained the notice, as was requested by Sj, but I would prefer not to leave misleading notices of things that no longer occur. If the bootcamp does stop being regular, it would be good if the template were to be killed so that people don't see out-of-date references. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="grey">Talk</font></a> 11:03, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Asbestos. It is still going on sporadically, although the web-IRC interface isn't working as smoothly as it used to. Right now bootcamps only happen when one is specifically encouraged on other IRC chans; maybe we need to find a better way to focus them. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 17:57, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's a great idea too. but needs to be more ongoing and frequent. I have this suggestion:
<dl>
<dd>For those who maintain an IRC connection on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">Freenode</a> just stay in <b>#wpbootcamp</b> continually. Have <i><b>daily</b></i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Plenary" class="extiw" title="wikt:Plenary">Plenary</a> <a href="../../../s/e/s/Session.html" title="Session">sessions</a> at <b>noon and midnight</b> and use a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_bot.html" title="Internet bot">bot</a> on <b>#wikipedia'</b> to announce the regular meeting. Freenode does allow <i>"blessed"</i> bots in circumstances like this. I've added <b>#wpbootcamp</b> to my autojoin list on my <a href="../../../x/-/c/X-chat.html" title="X-chat">X-chat</a> <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_client_2c8a.html" title="IRC client">IRC client</a>, and if I'm online I'm there right now.

</dd>
<dd>I like this idea of daily sessions. I was thinking yesterday about long-term goals of bootcamp. I'd like for it to turn into a set of voluntary self-assessment tests for new users. If you want to pick up external validation that you've mastered some aspect of Wiki, you go to the right bootcamp subpage, carry out the relevant tasks, and show up at a bootcamp session for comment/verification.</dd>

<p>For the next few weeks, we can treat bootcamp as office hours for newbies; both on-wiki and on IRC. Actively checking talk pages, and responding to people on IRC, for fast-turnaround help. I can cover midnight-to-1am EST; can someone else cover noon-to-1pm? We can even set up a little <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBootcamp_calendar_3d5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bootcamp/calendar">calendar</a>. During office hours, we can hash out how to develop bootcamps over time; what newbies need to know; ways to reach people other than greeting them. We can ask the people who show up what the want to learn about, and design from there... <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 18:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if this would be feasible for Wikipedia or not, but would this work better as a Teamspeak server?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably not in my opinion. When we're on IRC, one instructor can easily follow up on several recruits, and there's also a lower threshold for actually connecting, as it's only text (and not voice to voice with a complete stranger). If we'd go over to Teamspeak, it would require a soundcard/microphone/speakers or headset, and would also make it harder to help someone. If you ask a question on IRC, I can see the question several hours after, and if you're still on, I could respond; whereas in Teamspeak I'd have to hear the question there and then, meaning that I'd actually have to listen all the time, instead of just checking every now and then on IRC. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 23:40, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>All Bootcamp participants are invited to help design and build the tractorBot. I am refactoring tractor's user page into some sections that I hope will make the aims and functions of the bot a bit more consice. These will become the <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractor_c5c1.html#Requirements" title="User:Tractor">User:Tractor#Requirements</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractor_c5c1.html#Specifications" title="User:Tractor">User:Tractor#Specifications</a> and I'm hoping to get some important help from the folks in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/perl" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/perl" rel="nofollow">#perl</a>, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/poe" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/poe" rel="nofollow">#poe</a> and of course the very busy <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaWiki_8838.html" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> developers. I'm fairly certain that the tractor will be written in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a> using the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl_Object_Environment_a0c8.html" title="Perl Object Environment">Perl_Object_Environment</a> as an engine. Coders are certainly welcome, but it's important to know how the bootcamp realtime help system works, and ya kind of have to be there to get the picture.</dd>
<dd>One of the main functions, the way I see it (as the human 'driver' of the tractor) is to maintain a steady and consistant follow-up on Bootcamp recruits ('victims') to extract and report on their activities and progress. It's best of course, to do this with the Human touch. The bot is simply here to help us Humans function better as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit.html" title="Unit">Unit</a>, dedicated to helping new Users with common problems. I think we're here for the long haul, and the sevice is proving useful to new users. Your comments and questions here would be most valuable.</dd>
<dd>I realize that there have been some concerns and questions about the military metaphors we've used in the past, but every effort is being made to keep Wikipedia policies and guidelines at the core of the design. I'm commited to designing and building one of the most useful and sensitive bots on the Internet, and there is no place like the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBootcamp_eb4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Bootcamp">Wikipedia:Bootcamp</a> (that I've found) for fully utilizing this implement. But I must hear from you to get it right. Grab the steering wheel! Crank up the throttle!

<p>Hmmm... some thoughts about this GREAT!! site (I really think it's great!)</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>poor children in African villages</i>" - if they don't have a printed encyclopedia then they most likely (MORE likely) have no Internet access either. If that is the mission then everyone please contribute to the French Wikipedia, not the English one - they will be more likely to read French than English in the majority of African countries. Also, using the stereotype of the poor African village is by my very personal opinion not very nice... there are plenty of poor illiterate children in the First World (e.g., in the U.S.) as well that crave knowledge. I think "<i>underpriviliged children around the world</i>" could be a more neutral term.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>It is also important to maintain democracy that people be able to state unpopular opinions without necessarily attaching them to their real name</i>" - is democracy the correct term here? This sounds to me more like a subset of Western values of liberalism. I don't find it in any (printed) definition of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> yet... Maybe it's better to invoke the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a> or human rights here because I think that's more accurate but may sound to grand.</li>
