<p>I'm not interested in following the above chit chat to discover what is at stake in the current edit war/civilised discussion about the intro to this article, however I will note that I do not find the following paragraph acceptable:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A related subject that is sometimes referred to as Boolean algebra is <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>, which might be defined as what all Boolean algebras have in common. It consists of relationships among elements of a Boolean algebra that always hold, no matter which Boolean algebra one starts with. Since the algebra of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic_gate.html" title="Logic gate">logic gates</a> and some <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_circuit.html" title="Electrical circuit">electrical circuits</a> is formally the same, Boolean logic is studied in engineering and computer science, as well as in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_logic.html" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph makes the following false claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the theory described at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> captures <i>what all Boolean algebras have in common</i></li>
<li>and that that theory <i>consists of relationships among elements of a Boolean algebra that always hold, no matter which Boolean algebra one starts with</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The theory at the boolean logic page gives a simplified account of the model and proof theory of Boolean inference, that is correct in the finite case but in the infinite case can diverge, so that the models are sound wrt. the notion of inference but not complete.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both Boolean algebra and Boolean logic are of interest to mathematical logicians: the former is not only some logically irrelevant exercise that mathematicians play with. If this paragraph is not fixed, I will delete it. (And so, I fear, find myself drawn into the above..) --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:36, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, first, in the last paragraph, when you say "Boolean algebra", do you mean "the study of Boolean algebras", or something else? What you say is true in any case; I just think we have to be extremely careful in this context to nail down the meaning of all mass-noun uses. I would prefer to completely avoid any mass-noun use of the term "Boolean algebra" on the page that talks about Boolean algebras, except when mentioning that usage as a linguistic alternative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now more into the substance:
<ol>
<li>What's at the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> page, at least the last time I looked, really had <i>no</i> account, simplified or otherwise, of the model theory. Yes, there were hints from which you could reconstruct a model theory if you were so inclined, but it would be exaggerated to call it an "account". Or putting it another way, interpretation was discussed, but structures were not. So I rounded off and spoke as though that page were just about the syntactic relations. I agree that's less than an ideal solution.</li>
<li>Given that, as far as I can tell, there <i>is</i> no model theory described at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>, I find it hard to interpret your claim that the model theory and the proof theory can diverge. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I certainly didn't intend to imply that mathematical logicians aren't interested in Boolean algebras! (Look up the title of my dissertation--can be found through my user page's link to an external site.) Sloppy editing, possibly; I mainly wanted to <i>remove</i> the claim that computer scientists and engineers <i>are</i> interested in Boolean algebras, as I've never seen a nontrivial example of this (would love to see an example if it exists! that would be great; I'm certainly not <i>against</i> such applications). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:38, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We may conclude that Trovatore would prefer not to see another Boolean algebra for, say, the next five years — but probably misses the bodies at the beach.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 22:32, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theoretical computer science today draws on some topics that even Charles Stewart might enjoy: topos theory, model theory, intuitionist logic, and more. Here's a sentence from a recent abstract:
<ul>
<li><i>Starting from a given denotational description of a computational situation, an axiomatic semantics can be derived in a quite automatic way by using the mathematical framework of Stone duality. The basic idea (due to Abramsky) is that the classic Stone representation theorem for Boolean algebras is the key to establish a correspondence (actually a duality of categories) between denotational semantics (spaces of points which are denotations of computational processes) and program logics (lattices of properties of processes).</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'd have to dig a little more to find an engineering example, but perhaps this will suffice. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 01:03, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That'll do it! I withdraw my objection to saying that computer scientists use Boolean algebras. Though maybe we should emphasize <i>theoretical</i> computer scientists. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 01:10, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Computer science <i>is</i> theoretical computer science, and mostly consists of mathematics. That other stuff is computer <i>programming</i> (or hardware design), which "real" computer scientists only do for fun.&#160;;-) Whether that's a good split or not is a different question. I notice Gauss didn't think it beneath him to apply mathematics to physics, yet still managed to prove a deep theorem or two. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 21:52, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The BL page talks simply about what WP calls the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">algebra of sets</a>, truth tables, Venn diagrams, etc. which are a well understood class of models of classical propositional logic for which it is not complete. It does not talk very formally about them, but they are being given as the kind of interpretation one has in mind for the logic, which can mislead and is what I object to. We know there are no nontrivial examples of BAs, unless there is such a thing as trivial, infinitely large examples... --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:47, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid I'm going to need you to tell me slower what you mean by the above statement about completeness. The only interpretation I can come up with is that there are (presumably first-order) sentences that are true in every algebra of sets (or maybe every Boolean algebra?), but that are not derivable from the classical propositional calculus. What would be an example of that? Something like "there exists an atom", I guess, would be true in every algebra of sets (though not every Boolean algebra), but wouldn't be derivable; is that the kind of thing you meant? I certainly don't think we should be claiming that the existence of atoms is a part of Boolean logic; if you feel that the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> page <i>does</i> imply that, then maybe that's a flaw in <i>that</i> page. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:14, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's the propositional theory, but where we allow infinite conjunctions and/or disjunctions. The mismatch between the two halves is described at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone%27s_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras_58f8.html" title="Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras">Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras</a>: it's nontrivial mathematically, and it's no problem for the BL article except for claims that the BL article is about just the same thing as the BA article but for some things only mathematicians care about. I'm a logician and not a mathematician, trust me when I say it's not true. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 20:22, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What's the referent of "it" in the first sentence of the above paragraph? Are you saying that such infinitary formulae are part of Boolean logic? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:30, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The BL article explicitly says it is talking about the finite case. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Oh, or maybe you're saying that there are infinitary formulas that hold in every BA and are thus part of "what all BAs have in common", but which are <i>not</i> covered by the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article. I suppose that's a good point. Could it be addressed by saying that Boolean logic is "roughly what all BAs have in common", or maybe "all simple things that all BAs have in common"? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:38, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Better, the logic of infinite propositional formulae is a kind of logic beyond the topic treated by BL, but within the scope of BA. <i>Roughly</i> is a good word for indicating the kind of imprecision in the claim, though it doesn't help the reader find out what the imprecision is. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So finally maybe I may see what <i>you</i> mean by Boolean algebra as a mass noun. As I say though, I really think we should scrupulously avoid using it as a mass noun in an article that discusses the structure. We can always say "the infinitary logic of Boolean algebras" for the concept described above.</dd>
<dd>On the "roughly" question, you're right, of course. But we aren't going to find a perfect solution and maybe that one's not too bad. I would really like to see a better definition given for "Boolean logic", whether or not it corresponds to the content of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:40, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I agree with both points of what Trovatore said, though I think there is a question mark hanging over the BL article (principally: contributors find it difficult to figure out what goes where, but there are other issues). <i>The infinitary logic of Boolean algebras</i> is a good phrase, kudos. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 20:15, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a discussion on <a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq's</a> talk page (section named "peace") regarding renaming this article. The goal is to make it no longer a place where people looking for the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article's content arrive in error. This would make it no longer imperative that the intro be readable by a general audience. (While all intros should technically be readable by a general audience, if no member of the general audience ever finds the article, it isn't an issue.) There have been two suggestions, both of which I support:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a> suggested renaming <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_lattice.html" title="Boolean lattice">Boolean lattice</a> and changing <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> into a disambiguation page pointing to both <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_lattice.html" title="Boolean lattice">Boolean lattice</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> suggested renaming <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> to Boolean algebra (algebraic structure) and moving the content from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> directly to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If either plan can garner enough support, we can solve this issue permanently and avoid any painful edit wars. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 18:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But <i>Boolean lattice</i> is certainly a less common name than <i>Boolean algebra</i>, so that would go against a basic policy on page titles. The second suggestion doesn't have that difficulty. I think the usual solution would mix those: <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> is ambiguous enough to have that as the dab page; and Boolean algebra (algebraic structure) or something comparable is a good-enough page name. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 18:52, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Renaming this article to Boolean algebra (algebraic structure) but leaving <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> as a disambiguation page has one problem, though, I'm afraid those looking for the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> content may not be able to tell that that's the one they want. They might have been looking under the name <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> and then proceed to Boolean algebra (algebraic structure), reasoning that the title at least contains the term they are looking for. Thus, the need for an intro understandable by the general audience would remain. Either renaming this article to one which is obviously not what they want, like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_lattice.html" title="Boolean lattice">Boolean lattice</a>, or filling this article with the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> content, would prevent this from happening. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about Boolean algebra theory as the disambiguated version of the mass-noun? It could have a subarticle called Boolean algebra (mathematical object) if necessary, which would hopefully make clear to anyone that this is not a theory but an object.

<dd>That name works for me. The current content of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> is really those topics from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> which are aimed at common applications, like database queries, search page queries, and circuit design. That includes <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-valued_logic.html" title="Two-valued logic">two-valued logic</a>, but is not necessarily limited to it. Some theory is also included, but only as much as is needed for common applications. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 14:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Responding to MarSch). A Boolean algebra models the propositional calculus in the following sense: If you take any tautology of the propositional calculus, and any Boolean algebra B, and substitute the letters in the tautology by elements of B, you get an expression that evaluates to the 1 of B.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure exactly what you mean by the "for a certain number of propositions" part. Many Boolean algebras are not in any obvious way expressible as being about propositions; they're just algebraic structures that happen to satisfy the axioms of the propositional calculus in the sense above. We're interested in their <i>structural</i> properties, not just their logical ones. How many elements do they have? Are they atomic/atomless/free/complete/countably saturated/etc etc etc? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would support naming the articles Boolean algebra (abstract algebra) and Boolean algebra (logic). That's kind of parallel and consistent; the articles might well begin "In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra is..." and "In logic, Boolean algebra is...". It shouldn't be that difficult to write a clear dab page.

<p>Under the examples section for boolean algebra, I was hoping to see an explanation of the Boolean algebra formed of <a href="../../../w/e/l/Well-formed_formulas.html" title="Well-formed formulas">wffs</a> made out of some propositions (possibly mod tautology, à la <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindenbaum-Tarski_algebra_80eb.html" title="Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra">Lindenbaum-Tarski</a>).

Seems to me like it ought to be a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Boolean_algebra_2667.html" title="Free Boolean algebra">free Boolean algebra</a>, in fact, and that the example on that page is simply the language of a propositional logic with 2 propositions (mod tautology). If that is so, it seems like a very economical way to define a propositional language. And a truth assignment is simply a Boolean algebra homomorphism to {0,1}. Any comments?

<dd>I went ahead and added my example anyway. If there's a problem, do what you gotta do. I have one concern though: tautologies are defined in terms of truth assignments, so I can't define a truth assignment in this way (in terms of the Lindenbaum algebra). This definition is circular. It seems to me that the truth assignment should be properly defined as a homomorphism from the free <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Distributive_lattice.html" title="Distributive lattice">distributive lattice</a></i> to {0,1}. Tautologies would then be the intersection of all the preimages of 1 (sentences which are true in every truth assignment). -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 21:54, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I can see no objection to what you've added (except that the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindenbaum_algebra.html" title="Lindenbaum algebra">Lindenbaum algebra</a> article says that it's for a specific logical theory, and you haven't explicitly said which one). But what I'm interested in is, should this be in the intro as the first example, rather than just one among many? No one has responded to my question in the section above (<a href="#Example_in_intro" title="">#Example in intro</a>), about whether it's more natural to start with an example with three <i>atoms</i>, or with three <i>generators</i>.

<dd>Oh, I see, yes. This is probably the most important example of a Boolean algebra, and should be given prominence. That's why I was surprised not to see it. And now I see that you've been looking for the same example. As for mentioning an explicit theory, I'm pretty vague on what that means. Maybe a theory is the set of sentences closed under semantic implication. or the set of sentences true in a given structure. I'm not sure how that relates to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebras</a>.

<dd>The Lindenbaum article talks about a <i>logical</i> theory, which is a redlink. I assume it means something like classical propositional logic (one logical theory), or intuitionistic propositional logic (a different one). My guess is that intuitionistic propositional logic would not get you a Boolean algebra (because you wouldn't get ¬¬p=p). My concern here is not with the content, but with the link to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindenbaum-Tarski_algebra_80eb.html" title="Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra">Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra</a>; the latter seems to be somewhat at odds with what you say in the example.

<dd>Hmmm I skimmed a lot of the discussion above between you, Celestian, StuRat, and Charles. I can see that you all have worked hard to reach a balance between the people who want concise correctness and the people who want colloquial verbosity. But the current state is, in my opinion, unacceptable. Therefore, unfortunately, a new balance will have to be struck. Yesterday I removed "a set of objects, called "elements"". That's just ridiculous, this is not the place to teach people the definitions from day 1 of set theory 101. Today it was "operation which takes one or two elements". The scare quotes are annoying, and the whole thing sounds terrible.</dd>

<dd>Here is the intro I would like:
<dl>
<dd>"In <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, a <b>Boolean algebra</b> is a set with three operations which satisfy the most familiar properties of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection.html" title="Intersection">intersection</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union.html" title="Union">union</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complement.html" title="Complement">complement</a> of sets; or alternatively,the properties of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjunction.html" title="Conjunction">conjunction</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disjunction.html" title="Disjunction">disjunction</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negation.html" title="Negation">negation</a> of logical propositions. The latter in fact provide a commonly encountered example of a Boolean algebra: a set of Boolean variables (variables which can take a value of true or false) and the corresponding logical operations. A Boolean algebra abstracts these notions, allowing their structure to be studied generally, and elucidating ties to other areas of mathematics. The axioms of a Boolean algebra characterize the difference between <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_logic.html" title="Classical logic">classical logic</a> and more modern forms of logic, which are usually associated with generalizations of the Boolean algebra.</dd>

<dd>I gave up on improving the intro in the face of aggressive opposition. My last compromise (incorporating bits I would not have said on my own in the penultimate paragraph) appears on the talk page <a href="#alternate_opening" title="">here</a>. In contrast, the present version wastes the first paragraph gently saying almost nothing, and the subsequent paragraphs are dubious. However, <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a> had this to say about my final attempt: "Your version, KSmrq, was (as far as non-mathematicians see it) patent nonsense and therefore was reverted." And <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> perceived my use of notation as a "series of random characters". Concluding there was no hope of meaningful compromise with such extreme positions, I abandoned my efforts. Perhaps you will have better luck.

<dd>I hadn't seen your version. I guess I must have stepped on some toes, coming here and complaining about an intro that has already been worked over so many times. But the intro that was left when I showed up here was just bad, no offense intended to the people who worked on it. Perhaps it was just a casualty of the wiki process. Anyway, your intro looks pretty good, so I'll see if I can use it.
<dl>
<dd>I can't speak for others, but my toes are perfectly happy. I don't hold my final version as polished perfection, but a step in the right direction. Feel free to use it verbatim, or as inspiration, or not at all. Secrets to good writing include rewriting, and the guts to "murder your children". (It is common practice on DVD releases of films to show a scene that was reluctantly cut, often with a voice-over by the director rhapsodizing about the great acting. That's the ghost of a murdered child.)

<dd>Rather than debate "axioms" vs "rules", I'd just leave off the last sentence (about generalizations) altogether. The phrase "more modern forms of logic" is problematic (what's really meant, I think, is <i>weaker</i> forms of logic, like intuitionistic or linear), but more to the point, it's likely to make people think that the content of the study of Boolean algebras is more logical than mathematical.

<dl>
<dd>So I'd like to point out that Lethe's proposed first paragraph (which looks generally pretty good to me, if the accessibility party accepts it) suffers from the same ambiguity as my example. It says:
<dl>
<dd><i>The latter in fact provide a commonly encountered example of a Boolean algebra: a set of Boolean variables (variables which can take a value of "true" or "false") and the corresponding logical operations.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>OK, so say you've got three variables, p, q, and r. Does that mean that the elements of the BA are things like "p and q and ¬r", and if you "and" that with "p and ¬q and r" you get "p and ¬q and ¬r" -- that is, applying the "and" operation variable-by-variable? Or when you "and" those two things, do you just get FALSE, because (for example) one of them implies q, and the other ¬q, so they can't both be true?</dd>
<dd>The first interpretation would take p, q, and r to be atoms of the Boolean algebra, and give a BA with 8 elements. The second one (the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Boolean_algebra_2667.html" title="Free Boolean algebra">free Boolean algebra</a> with generators p,q,r) would have as atoms all the elements of the first BA, and would have 256 elements.</dd>
<dd>In some ways I like the 3-atom, 8-element version precisely because it's clear that it's <i>not</i> purely logical, because it's not free. (The 8-element BA is the smallest one that's not free.) On the other hand it's possibly a little harder to motivate in a few words. But surely we shouldn't have language that could be read as either one or the other, which is the case for both my version and Lethe's. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:11, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the suggestion is to put that discussion into the intro; I think the suggestion is to be certain that what the intro says, at whatever level of detail, is correct, which we can talk about at length here, if that's what it takes. I agree it's a little ambiguous as it is now. Have we described a Boolean algebra with 8 elements? Or 2<sup>8</sup> elements? Or what, have we described, in that sentence? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:06, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure I understand what the problem is. Why do we have to know exactly what algebra we're talking about? I basically modelled my intro on the intro to <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Field (mathematics)">field (mathematics)</a>. A field has addition and multiplication and division. A field has 0 and 1. That certainly isn't enough to decide what field we're talking about. I think it's OK to say a Boolean algebra has negation disjunction and conjunction, and leave unspecified what the values of those operations are. In other words, it isn't intended to be a specific algebra, but rather a class of examples. If your p, q, and r are independent propositions, then we'll have a free algebra. If they're not independent, then it won't be (in which case, the algebra may not have 8 <i>or</i> 256 elements). -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:12, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, it's just that, when I read the current intro, I get confused, and it's not because it isn't specific, it's because it's sort of half-specific, in a way that makes me think two different things, and I find that confusing. When we say "As a simple example, there might be three conditions that can be independently true or false...," we're apparently setting up a real specific example, but there's just shy of enough information for me to get it. We're very specific in passing from 3 to 8, (and that the propositions <i>are</i> independent), but then silent on the next step.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, we don't "have to know exactly what algebra we're talking about" if we're just being general. If we're giving an example in the intro, I think it should be one that is identifiable as itself, whatever it is. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 17:13, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I guess we could add some words that allude to the free algebra. Actually, just adding the words "independent" should do it. But I'm still not convinced of the necessity. I guess I don't understand what Trovatore is saying about atoms. Why would anyone assume that someone was talking about atoms? Atoms are not logically independent, at least not in the example we're looking at. As far as I can tell, the only thing special about atoms is that they are successors to 0, and they provide an easy means for calculating the size of the algebra. And what kind of an algebra would have 3 atoms? not a free one, since a free algebra has 2^n atoms. So it's probably not true that an algebra with 3 atoms has 8 total elements. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 19:57, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Any finite Boolean algebra (more generally, any complete atomic Boolean algebra) is completely determined by its atoms, and a Boolean algebra with n atoms has 2^n elements (an element is precisely categorized by which atoms are below it). No, atoms are not independent (in the sense that there are nontrivial relationships between them), but they could represent combinations of truth values of independent propositions, as I outlined at the start of this section). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:48, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, so all Boolean algebras have order 2^n, not just free algebras. I didn't realize that, since I only know about atoms what I've read here. So I guess your point is that the atoms can determine algebra, just as well as the generators can, right?<small><a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 17:07, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>That's true for <i>complete atomic</i> Boolean algebras, which for me more or less coincide with "trivial" Boolean algebras. All finite Boolean algebras are, of course, trivial. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:50, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>So if you want to specify an algebra, you can specify its generators equally well? Sure, that makes sense. But I still don't think the intro needs to be specific about it. We have Boolean variables <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>r</i>, and we have that <i>p</i> ∨ <i>q</i> and ¬<i>r</i> are in the algebra, but don't need to state whether they're true or false or equal to each other or anything in this intro any more than I need to state that <i>g</i><sub>1</sub><i>g</i><sub>2</sub> is equal to <i>g</i><sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup> in <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> in the intro of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">group (mathematics)</a>. Anyway, that's how I'm thinking about it now, but it could be that I'm still not understanding your concern rightly. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 17:07, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been lurking, but abstaining from commenting. (Once burned, twice shy. Still, the burning happened some weeks ago.) What I'd like to suggest is that the long discussion about atoms and generators is theoretically interesting, but the intro raises such issues unnecessarily. Compare to the following wording:</p>
<hr style="width:15em" />
<p>In <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_algebra.html" title="Abstract algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a <b>Boolean algebra</b> is an <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_structure.html" title="Algebraic structure">algebraic structure</a> (a collection of elements and operations on them obeying specific axioms) that captures essential properties of both <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a> operations and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> operations. Specifically, it deals with the <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a> operations of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Intersection (set theory)">intersection</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Union (set theory)">union</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complement_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Complement (set theory)">complement</a>; and the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> operations of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_conjunction.html" title="Logical conjunction">AND</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_disjunction.html" title="Logical disjunction">OR</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_negation.html" title="Logical negation">NOT</a>.</p>

<p>Because truth values can be represented as <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_numeral_system.html" title="Binary numeral system">binary numbers</a> or as voltage levels in <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic_circuit.html" title="Logic circuit">logic circuits</a>, the parallel extends to these as well.

<p>A Boolean algebra is also called a <b>Boolean lattice</b>. The connection to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lattice_%28order%29.html" title="Lattice (order)">lattices</a> (special <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partially_ordered_set.html" title="Partially ordered set">partially ordered sets</a>) is suggested by the parallel between set <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subset.html" title="Subset">inclusion</a>, <i>A</i>&#160;⊆&#160;<i>B</i>, and <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_theory.html" title="Order theory">ordering</a>, <i>a</i>&#160;≤&#160;<i>b</i>. Consider the lattice of all subsets of {<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>}, ordered by set inclusion. This Boolean lattice is a partially ordered set in which, say, {<i>x</i>} &#160;≤&#160;{<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>}. Any two lattice elements, say <i>p</i>&#160;= {<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>} and <i>q</i>&#160;= {<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>}, have a least upper bound, here {<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>}, and a greatest lower bound, here {<i>y</i>}. Suggestively, the least upper bound (or join or supremum) is denoted by the same symbol as logical OR, <i>p</i>∨<i>q</i>; and the greatest lower bound (or meet or infimum) is denoted by same symbol as logical AND, <i>p</i>∧<i>q</i>.</p>
<p>The lattice interpretation helps in generalizing to <a href="../../../h/e/y/Heyting_algebra.html" title="Heyting algebra">Heyting algebras</a>, which are Boolean algebras freed from the restriction that either a statement or its negation must be true. Heyting algebras correspond to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionistic_logic.html" title="Intuitionistic logic">intuitionist (constructivist) logic</a> just as Boolean algebras correspond to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_logic.html" title="Classical logic">classical logic</a>.</p>
<hr style="width:15em" />
<p>Such an introduction seems to state the heart of the topic with both specificity and generality, while avoiding questions of atoms versus generators.

Previously one or two people slammed the door on discussion, a violation of <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a> which needn't happen this time.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, whether it's adopted or not, I trust this version demonstrates to your satisfaction that issues of atoms and generators can be avoided. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:17, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose. I'm a little reluctant because it seems to me that it's the only thing that makes the discussion of <i>finite</i> Boolean algebras even remotely interesting. It had seemed to me that, since a finite Boolean algebra is, rather trivially, determined up to isomorphism by its size, there wasn't much to discuss about them <i>other</i> than their size. When I started looking at the free BAs, I realized that there is something a little bit interesting: it's obvious that permutations of the generators give rise to automorphisms, and similarly for atoms, but a priori this is a little surprising, because the atoms and the generators are related in a slightly complicated way. To put it another way, if you're just given a Hasse diagram of a Boolean algebra whose cardinality is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/7/1/b7118a777168022f01f7439db6d769ad.png" alt="2^{2^n}" />, you know it must be free (because it's isomorphic to the free BA with <i>n</i> generators). But how do you pick out a set of generators? It's not quite obvious. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:29, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've lost me. I thought you were neutral on whether the intro should address specific algebras, but that if it did it should do so unambiguously. Are you saying that the intro itself <i>should</i> mention atoms and generators? Are you also asking that it mention the dichotomy between finite and infinite BAs?

<dd>My skepticism shifts to the proposition that this stuff is properly called "electrical engineering", even if presented under IEEE auspices. My concern here really--and this applies to the CS application as well--is that readers will assume we must be talking about Boolean logic, because that's all they can imagine would be applicable to CS and EE. That's another reason I'd like a clear statement that we're talking about what the Charleses would call the "model theory" of the situation (though it's not really what <i>I</i> think of as model theory). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:23, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Yes let's keep the bit about George Boole. And yes there may be other tweaks that might be helpful (e.g. since "Boolean lattice" redirects here <i>I</i> might prefer retaining the mention of it in the first sentence, like it is now).

<dd>I have two very minor nits to pick with this intro. Most importantly, it seems to focus too much on sets and logic (that is, particular Boolean algebras) rather than the concept of Boolean algebras in general. While it is probably a good idea to mention that they <b>are</b> examples, I think accuracy has been sacrificed needlessly here. The second, much more minor, issue is that I would be wary of having formulae in the intro - simply because it becomes easier to assume knowledge of users that they might not have.</dd>
<dd>But, yes, definitely put this in the article ASAP. Even with these problems, it is several orders of magnitude better than the current one (which attempts to explain how to understand boolean algebras without realy explaining what they <b>are</b>...). LVC 03:25, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It strikes me that the current introduction is almost long enough to be a short article, and that it delves into very specific things (most of which I think too specific for an introduction). I notice similar problems with the alternate introductions proposed in this talk page. Also, I think the boolean logic article - and, by extension, the mention of it in this article - somewhat confuses the issue (despite its intentions to do otherwise). Hence, I propose the following, shortened, intro:</p>

<li>A Boolean algebra isn't a class of algebraic structure. It's an algebraic structure, or if you want to be more specific, an algebraic structure of a certain kind.</li>
<li>Who uses the term "Boolean algebra" to mean the study of Boolean algebras? Really, I don't think this is common, though it may happen. The mass-noun sense of "Boolean algebra" usually refers to a subject that never even mentions Boolean algebras.</li>
<li>See <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> for what an intro should cover. I think yours is too short by that standard.

<li>True. How about dropping the first 'a' as in: "In mathematics, <b>boolean algebra</b> refers to a class of algebraic structure - structures of this class are called boolean algebras ..."&#160;?</li>
<li>Point taken. That sentence seems more than a little clumsy in retrospect, anyway. The mass-noun subject, as I learned it, was very similar to how I learned logic (ie, it works with the two-element boolean algebra).</li>
<li>By my reading of that page, I still think alot of the stuff in the other intros shouldn't be in the intros (eg, a boolean algreba has a set, two binary operations, etc). I do agree that mine could do with a little beafing up, though. LVC 23:57, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On your point 1: No, I don't like that at all. I think we have to be very careful to keep "Boolean algebra" (note the capital B) as a count noun on this page, except in a single reference explicitly disambiguating from the mass-noun usage. So "Boolean algebra" should always take a determiner or be used in the plural. I think the current wording is fine.</dd>
<dd>On point 3: No, I think this level of detail is fine. I'm in favor of something along the lines of KSmrq's intro, with the caveats I've mentioned. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 00:05, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's necessary at a very minimum to note in the intro that a Boolean algebra is <b>defined</b> to be a lattice, together with two binary operations and one unary operation, satisfying certain axioms. The axioms themselves need not (and probably should not) be enumerated in the intro, but just saying that much will summarize huge amounts of information for anyone (like myself) who has worked with algebraic structures, but not necessarily with Boolean algebras. You can set it aside as a blockquote and call it a "formal" definition and reassure the reader that the terms in it will be unpacked further down the page, but it really should be there, for the mathematically savvy reader to get the information she needs quickly. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 00:20, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I should explain how discussion history has shaped intro choices. (Warning: POV ahead!) Not that long ago, the intro was brief, and targeted at students of abstract algebra. Then a cry of outrage went up, and rewrites began. The masses (mostly, one outspoken editor) had to be appeased, and even though it seems unlikely they had any interest in — nor comprehension of — the <i>content</i> of the article, naked phrases like <i><a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_structure.html" title="Algebraic structure">algebraic structure</a></i> in the intro were abhorent to them. In fact, anything that looked like mathematics, not everyday English, was vigorously rejected.</dd>
<dd>What to do? One approach is to throw away as much of the mathematical content as possible. That pleases only the non-mathematicians. Another approach is to soften the raw mathematics with explanatory phrases, like "a collection of elements and operations on them obeying specific axioms". Two words become thirteen, a dramatic increase in length; but now the non-mathematicians can follow along more easily.</dd>
<dd>I've seen a number of article intros fought over. I wish everyone could appreciate the competing interests and how difficult it is to satisfy them all. Instead, many editors write with little sensitivity for any view but their own, and write poorly at that.

<p>Since so many people have asked, I have installed a new introduction. Please understand that I do not think of this as "my" intro, nor do I intend to "defend" it from attackers. I have basically suspended non-typo editing of Wikipedia articles themselves and confined my attention to talk pages because of an accumulation of experiences with destructive behavior. I'm convinced Wikipedia needs to incorporate a serious quality control mechanism if it expects to achieve credibility as an encyclopedia. More personally, I find it hard to justify spending professional effort putting words into an article that any idiot can instantly override. Unlike articles, talk pages don't get trashed or reverted; those who disagree with my words can ignore or argue, while those who agree or appreciate can still read them and benefit. This slightly peculiar editorial stance seems better for both me and readers until such time as Wikipedia evolves. Nevertheless, I'm moved by the expressions of approval for this revised intro, so I've made an exception.

<p>I've been thinking about this article, and of a way to write the introduction, and although KSmrg beat me to it by a few days, I'll go ahead and post what I came up with here, because I've got nothing else useful to do with it. Perhaps something out of here can be used to continue to hone the live version ever closer to wiki-perfection:</p>
<hr />
<p>In <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, specifically in <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_algebra.html" title="Abstract algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a <b>Boolean algebra</b> is an <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_structure.html" title="Algebraic structure">algebraic structure</a> that generalizes structures arising both in <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a> and in <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>. The set theoretic operations of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Intersection (set theory)">intersection</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Union (set theory)">union</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complement_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Complement (set theory)">complementation</a> follow the same algebraic rules as the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logical</a> operations of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_conjunction.html" title="Logical conjunction">AND</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_disjunction.html" title="Logical disjunction">OR</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_negation.html" title="Logical negation">NOT</a>. A Boolean algebra is a structure on which these rules can be studied in a general context, without referring specifically to set theory or to logic. Boolean algebras are named after <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boole_832a.html" title="George Boole">George Boole</a>.</p>
<p>By definition, a Boolean algebra is a <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a>, equipped with two <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_operation.html" title="Binary operation">binary operations</a>, and with one <a href="../../../u/n/a/Unary_operation.html" title="Unary operation">unary operation</a>. The operations must follow a list of axioms, given in the complete formal definition below. First, in order to better understand this definition, we consider the two examples already mentioned:</p>

Boolean lattice of subsets</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>For our set, we take the collection of the eight subsets of a three-element set: {{}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x,y}, {x,z}, {y,z}, {x,y,z}}. On this set, we define the binary operations of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Union (set theory)">union</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Intersection (set theory)">intersection</a>, and the unary operation of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complement_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Complement (set theory)">complementation</a>, in the usual way. This set of subsets, and these operations, compose a Boolean algebra with eight elements.</li>
<li>Now for our set, we choose a two element set, with binary truth values for elements: {TRUE, FALSE}. Our two binary operations are now AND and OR, and the unary operation is NOT. The usual rules, such as NOT TRUE = FALSE apply to these operations, and we thus have a very small <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-element_Boolean_algebra_eb47.html" title="Two-element Boolean algebra">two-element Boolean algebra</a>, which is exploited in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> studied in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Boolean algebras are sometimes called <b>Boolean lattices</b>, because every Boolean algebra also meets the definition of a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lattice_%28order%29.html" title="Lattice (order)">lattice</a>: a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partially_ordered_set.html" title="Partially ordered set">partially ordered set</a> with two binary operations satisfying certain axioms. The axioms for a Boolean algebra allow for a partial ordering to be defined in a natural way, such that the axioms for a lattice are satisfied, so every Boolean algebra is automatically a lattice as well. Suggestively, the symbols used for logical AND ("∧"), and OR ("∨") are the same symbols used for the lattice operations of "least upper bound" (or "join" or "supremum") and "greatest lower bound" (or "meet" or "infimum").</p>
<p>The lattice interpretation helps in generalizing to <a href="../../../h/e/y/Heyting_algebra.html" title="Heyting algebra">Heyting algebras</a>, which are Boolean algebras freed from the restriction that either a statement or its negation must be true. Heyting algebras correspond to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionistic_logic.html" title="Intuitionistic logic">intuitionist (constructivist) logic</a> just as Boolean algebras correspond to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_logic.html" title="Classical logic">classical logic</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's a bit different from the new current version, which I shall refrain from calling KSmrg's. I think the version I'm suggesting might be aimed at a slightly more general audience (less dependence on formulas and symbols, no?), and might make the basic idea slightly more accessible, by motivating Boolean algebras as generalizations of more familiar structures, and referencing two examples in a little bit of detail. As you can see, by the end, I just transition back into the current version, not having any improvement to suggest there. If there's anything I wrote that's just dead wrong, please let me know (I was particularly stabbing in the dark about applications to comp sci). Or whatever feedback you've got, even if it's just that we should leave well enough alone. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>JA: My opine, no, this is an article on basics, and that sort of incidental is best lodged in the article on C. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 17:53, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I first picked up boolean operators in Basic, then in java (which uses mostly C syntax), then C, then etc (most programming languages taking their cue from C) . In fact, I'll wager that programmers and incidental computer users will likely actually be more familiar with the C syntax symbols than with the symbols mentioned here! Else I wouldn't have mentioned it. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 17:56, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JA: Sorry if I'm being brusque, but I'm trying to finish up 3 or 4 things in <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/b/6/6b6916dc719f0070115683ee61bb7cf9.png" alt="\|" /> before the weekend. The article in view is a math article, and it's kind of important in math not to confuse math notations with math objects. We try to mention 3 or 4 diff notations, but trying to mention them all is neither possible nor very helpful. And besides, there are lots of other pages that cover the peculiarities of this or that pet syntax. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 18:50, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Those C notation operators would be more at home in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article, which is written with applications such as computer science in mind. Specifically, I suggest adding that notation under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html#Other_notation" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic#Other notation</a>. This article, on the other hand, is written exclusively for mathematicians. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would prefer to say this article is written for anyone who is interested in the fundamental mathematics of Boolean algebras.

<dd>You say that like it's a bad thing.</dd>
<dd>Seriously, though, you probably can't understand this article unless you have some prior familiarity with algebraic structures. But that's not the fault of the article -- it's inherent to the topic. Boolean algebras are a more advanced topic (at least at the entry level) than simpler algebraic structures like <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a>, and you probably shouldn't try to learn about them until you've cut your teeth on the simpler ones.
