<p>In response to your comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scm83x&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43756781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scm83x&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43756781" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I believe that the neutrality and factual accuracy of all articles on the Wikipedia is the business of all Wikipedians. Furthermore, regarding your comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Byrd_%28Cherokee_Chief%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43758146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Byrd_%28Cherokee_Chief%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43758146" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I'm not sure what you're insinuating and about whom, but please keep it <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that no one can <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> any particular article. I saw a revert war brewing so, I jumped in as a neutral party. Dispute resolution should not happen in edit summaries or page reversions, but instead in frank discussion on talk pages. Such a discussion is now on-going at the talk page, which I am very excited about. If you believe that NPOV and following copyright law should be goals of all Wikipedians, then please take some time to read through the page as a neutral party and view the images in the context of copyright laws. I think that you will see that the page certainly does have some NPOV issues (e.g. "His new security force was directed by executive order of Byrd to show muscle for the <i>most brazen exercise of anti-democratic power in the modern history of the United States</i>."). And the copyvio discussion is underway at the Talk page.

<li>I've seen your comments. First, I have never claimed ownership of Joe Byrd (Cherokee Chief) I've merely contributed to the article. Second, I was very civil. As you know I can be quite uncivil, but I'm trying very hard to refrain from that sort of behavior. I find it degrading and insulting that certain ones seem to be allowed to do whatever they want to and others cannot. I'm only one person in the multitudes, but I feel I have a voice too. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 13:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Bookofsecrets. I did not mean to imply that I think/thought you are/were an aggie. I was just alluding to the fact that rivals of UT make fun of the hand-sign, and I've heard them say a lot of things, but I've never heard them call it a "finger deal".

<p>I do not understand the reasons anyone would want to block Waya sahoni. It seems there are users that are clearly out to get him. Why? --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 04:29, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote a note to the admin who blocked Waya sahoni asking him to reconsider. I don't know if that admin was aware of the pending arbitration before he blocked the account. The statements and threats made by Waya sahoni after being blocked will make it very difficult to convince any admin to unblock him. I personally believe that his behavior warrants a permanent ban, but only after he is given a fair hearing. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 05:08, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>On his talk page he demands that certain images be removed because he "clearly didn't have permission to post any of it here. I will have to notify them immediately that their materials are being used on WP without proper permission." He admits to having violated someone else's copyright and is now threatening Wiki with the consequences of his own deliberate violation. Very few admins will have much sympathy for an editor who has admitted his purpose here was to plant materials on Wiki in violation of copyright. Assuming, that is, that he is telling the truth about the copyright status of the images. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 05:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Okay. I'd read that on his talkpage. After private conversations with him via email I took those comments as letting off steam. I have no idea of your cultural background, but we Cherokee, sometimes, can have a terrible time controlling our tempers. I'm not saying he is right or he is wrong.

<p>Hi, do you have any idea why Waya sahoni was blocked? I'll remain anonymous for now, reply here if you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Various wikipedians were constantly accusing him of being Jeff Merkey. He constantly told them they were mistaken in his identity. Then he was working on an article concerning <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Byrd_%28Cherokee_Chief%29_84dc.html" title="Joe Byrd (Cherokee Chief)">Joe Byrd (Cherokee Chief)</a> and it had gotten to be a hot topic with many disputes. Regardless of what proof or citations he presented they were not seemingly good enough. I had attempted to assist in the citations of that same article. So I feel it is a personal vendetta. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 05:30, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>My guess is that people with some ability to actually look at substantive facts read "Waya sahoni's" posts, compared them with Merkey's, did some checking of IP addresses, and realized that "Waya sahoni" is in fact Jeffrey Vernon Merkey -- something which many of us have said for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Merkey was blocked as User:Gadugi. Creating a sockpuppet of yourself when you are already blocked is not tolerated here. "Waya sahoni" simply called too much attention to himself with his behavior (once again...) and blew his cover.</li>

<li>Which Waya/Jeff was sure to lose, which is the reason he tried to withdraw the arbitration request. Anyone with significant envolvement with Linux recognizes Jeff Merkey. Many of us have dealt with him for many years. Some have even had lawsuits brought against them - Which Jeff eventually dropped when it was obvious he was going to lose (sound familiar?). Some of us have been stalked by Jeff with searches of usenet/web for dirt to use against them. Does this sound like a nice man? Believe us... Waya is Jeff and the current verbal explosion on Waya sahoni's page proves it. I'm sorry you've been used, but Jeff is a master at using people. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryg_42b1.html" title="User:Jerryg">Jerry</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerryg_b2ed.html" title="User talk:Jerryg">Talk</a>) 06:14, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To answer your questions here and above, I was a named defendant in Merkey's <a href="http://scofacts.org/merkey.html" class="external text" title="http://scofacts.org/merkey.html" rel="nofollow">lawsuit</a> <a href="http://scofacts.org/Merkey-Perens-7.pdf" class="external text" title="http://scofacts.org/Merkey-Perens-7.pdf" rel="nofollow">"Merkey v Perens"</a>. You might gain some insight into Merkey's true personality by taking a little while to read some of what he says. He is not a nice person. I learned to recognize Merkey from ten miles away while I was preparing my defense. -- <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalks_to_birds_d6bf.html" title="User:Talks to birds">talks_to_birds</a> 06:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I scanned the aforementioned case. It tells a great deal about Jeff Merkey. However, it does not give me any indications that Waya sahoni and Jeff Merkey are on in the same. Waya sahoni has told me that he is related to Jeff Merkey, but he is not Jeff Merkey. I'm related to a great many people but that doesn't make me any one of them. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 06:35, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hey, it's been great working with you. I will take you into your true culture if you like. I'll setup a Wiki on a server for both of us to do Native American content. Let's just snatch the Ingineous Project materials and place it on this server. It'll be up later tonight at www.wikigadugi.org. Jeff said he will let me use his server since Wikipedia wants us gone. And you are a sysop and so are our friends. All my respect. Waya. Give me a couple of hours. We need a robot to start sucking wp content.

<p>How do you feel about "Waya sahoni" stealing content from Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Is *that* how *you* work?</p>
<p>That certainly is how Merkey works.</p>

<li>I am dropping the subject of Waya sahoni, Jeff Merkey, etc from this point forward. I suggest that no more comments be made on my talkpage in regards to these topics and I will do the same. I have no intentions of following up on the Joe Byrd article, but that is the only article in the Native American genre I plan on letting go to the wayside. I will edit to the best of my ability in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines.

<li>I find it unacceptable for anyone to doubt the validity of my years and years of genealogy research into MY ancestry. I'm not in the habit of fabricating ancestors. William "Braveheart" Wallace is an uncle many generations back from myself. It is common knowledge in the region I reside which is full of Wallace descendants. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 04:21, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
