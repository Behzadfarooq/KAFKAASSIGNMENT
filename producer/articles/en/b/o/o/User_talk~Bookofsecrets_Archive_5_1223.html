<li>It has come time to end this. Southern is inappropriate and very strongly biased. Tennessee is the 16th State to join The United States of America. It in geographically located in the Southeastern portion of the United States of America. In today's society Southern leaves heavy racist overtones and is offensive. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 06:57, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why did you add a link to the talk page at the top of the Tennessee article? This breaks several Wikipedia conventions and is not appropriate. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>My version of the lead paragraph bring Tennessee into the 21st Century and away from those outdated modes of thought.

<dd>I agree that the main body of a U.S. state article should <i>briefly</i> state its current status (location, area, population, and origin). I see no problem listing its admission sequence and year. Detail on all of these topics should be found within the various headings below the main body. Listing other details like economy, culture, and other significant events in the main paragraph just loads it up with baggage. All those topics are far too complex to introduce with just a simple summary. At any rate, you and I seem to be in agreement about this. Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On a side note, I'm thinking state trivia like state flower, etc. might have a place in the State box so all states are uniform in these matters. Or perhaps we can make a second box for state trivia. Again, the idea is to make it easy for people to generate a list of all the state flowers, etc., without having to bully their way through fifty articles. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are required to mention what your issue with the POV of an article is on the talk page when you place the notice. You have not done that on any of the recent articles you marked.

<li>It has become abundantly clear that some people from the SOUTHEASTERN United States of America have no pride and no honor. They honestly believe they honor their ancestors with their petty stand on "Southern Pride". Being a long time historian I can safely say that "my" ancestors, who fought in the Confederate Army, would not appreciate the way they conduct themselves at all. I was born, raised, and still reside in Tennessee. At this point forward anyone calling me a "Southerner" will be insulting me. I am from Tennessee, thus a Tennessean. Tennessee is in the Southeastern United States of America. The Confederate States of America has not existed since April 1865. Let it die and go on.

I do not want to be associated with the Pro-Southern movement or the organizations that are in that movement up past their eye balls. I am a <b>former</b> SCV member and I left that organization due to their desire to be activists' and radical in tone. I do not have time in my life for such things. I have grown beyond such infantile ideals. Those who desire to look foolish in the eyes of others can do so. I, sir, live in the Southeastern United States of America in the great state of Tennessee. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 12:48, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I certainly applaud your motives. I also live in Tennessee and would like for my state to not be percieved as hicksville. However, I do not believe it is Wikipedia's place to decide how Tennessee is characterized. Our job as encyclopedia editors is to distill (without bias) whatever the rest of the world has to say about Tennessee into one coherant summary. If the rest of the world calls Tennessee "Southern", then that is what we should write. If most of the world calls Tennessee "hicksville", that is what we should write as well. I'm afraid your perception of the word "Southern" may be somewhat distorted. In most people's minds the word Southern is simply a geographic term, although it certainly has cultural connotations from the South's history and its present, as do all geographic terms to an extent. I don't think anyone is trying to push a "Southern" agenda here. You must understand that a large portion of each state article is actaully written by a bot that culls information from the census databases. It is likely that a bot is actually the agent responsible for the convention of labeling these states "Southern" (since that is the official census region), although honestly I have no idea when or where the convention arose. I certainly don't think it was from anyone trying to be offensive, racist, or push a particular POV, however. Regardless, I'm withdrawing myself from the "Southern"/"Southeastern" debate, as I really don't think it's worth all the hubub. My only advice to you is to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and try harder to build consensus rather than spark debate. You may find that you attract more flies with honey than with vinegar, as they say. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>I certainly applaud your motives. I also live in Tennessee and would like for my state to not be percieved as hicksville.</i> Then you understand what I'm attempting to accomplish. I think wikipedia can be used to educate and sway the train of thought toward "hicksville" USA. Some friends of ours visited us from about 35 miles to our east. They honestly felt threatened and was afraid of hearing "dualing banjos" like in "Deliverance". I laughed, but I was also very upset that others see our region in that manner. It is one of my goal to see those perceptions changed in a positive way. I feel insulted when those kind of comments come in my direction. The Southeastern United States is very culturally diversified. Maybe all folks that say "Southern" don't mean it in a bad way. But those who use it for racist purposes are causing major issues for the rest of us. Personally, I don't appreciate it at all. I appreciate your kind words and your understanding. I will, however, consider those who push "Southern" in a certain manner as foolish and infantile. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 17:01, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
