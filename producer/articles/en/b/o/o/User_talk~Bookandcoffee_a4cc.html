<p>I am due to create about three stubs for unions in Gibraltar. Actually, they merged with the <a href="../../../t/g/w/TGWU_a4d7.html" title="TGWU">TGWU</a> and are part of that work that I am doing in trying to estabish an accurate list of unions that have merged with the T&amp;G opver the years. But there does not seem to be a category for TU's in Gibraltar.

<p>It might be useful to have a category for the GFTU so that affiliated unions could be quickly and easily identified. How to go about suggesting this? - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriniSocialist_6e5f.html" title="User:TriniSocialist">Dave Smith</a> 16:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, there’s been some similar work on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETrade_unions_of_Canada_e732.html" title="Category:Trade unions of Canada">Category:Trade unions of Canada</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETrade_unions_of_the_United_States_39da.html" title="Category:Trade unions of the United States">Category:Trade unions of the United States</a>, where we’ve started to split things out into the national unions. It’s been a bit hit and miss because there is a tendency of the articles getting moved back into the “of country” category when people don’t realize that the category is actually a sub-cat of the country. That being said, I think it’s a good idea, although I’d say you’d want to create the Category:Trades Union Congress at the same time. As for suggesting it – if it was me I’d just go ahead and do it. People will notice, and if there is any objection they’ll say (or change it back) and you’ll find yourself with a discussion about it then.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>I had a look at your GFTU re-write, it looks good. I like the history section, and nice work on filling out the member unions. I do have a comment about the Current role section. I would be tempted to reduce or combine a couple of the sub-sections. A lot of it seems like fairly standard stuff for unions in general, (research, pension) and only really differs for the GFTU in actual figures. If these are each in separate sections, does than mean there is more unique info to be added to each one? <small>(but I haven't had my coffee yet this morning, so take my comments with a grain of salt.&#160;:)</small> --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 19:03, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The previous intro, "Child labor or labour is the use of children for their labor, with little compensation or consideration for their personal development, safety, education, health, and future prospects" is subjective in that we can not objectively define 'consideration'. Who's consideration are we considering? the employer? parent? child? two out of three? How do we evaluate consideration of personal development? How do we know if future prospects have been adequately considered? by whom?</p>
<p>Even on the most quantifiable issue of 'compensation' how much compensation when compared to other low skilled workers in a given country? Do they need to make more than their parents?</p>
<p>The only objective thing that we can say is that child labor is when children are doing something that somebody values enough to pay for.</p>
<p>The issue of APPROPRIATE work is amazingly imperialistic (and paternalistic) in that WE decide THEY should be doing. Independent of what they want, we push for laws inhibiting their involvement in the legal labor market, and then we are shocked(!!) when then end up in prostitution, drug trade, and illegal sweatshops.</p>

<dd>Sure, looks okay. ...and not that subjectivity is intrinically bad. a QUOTED cited subjective statement is objective in that there is no opinion that that is what was said. a CITED non-quoted subjective statement is less objective, in that two readers may not agree about the proper interpretation of the statement. so I don't want to imply that subjective statements are out of place, but until we can get them cited from a verifiable source, I would prefer to keep our content contributions as clear and verifiable as possible. <a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomm_1fbd.html" title="User:Gomm">The Gomm</a> 04:05, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Book and Coffee Thanks you for the message. I have written on subject matter I have researched from Thesis on Joseph R. Knowland, my MA degree 1982 Univ San Francisco. The Knowland's Joseph, Joseph R. and William F. The Oakland Tribune where I worked as did my father. The Tribune Tower and the International Typographical Union of which myself, my father and my father oldest brother were members. Thanks for the information. Please let me know what my strengths and weaknesses are in my writing for you publication. I will have some questions. I have tried to do my best on here. Sincerely, USTYE</p>

<p>Is this a common approach? I have never seen it before. It seems to me that there are versioning, potential NPOV, and namespace problems that would preclude this project from functioning in the way it appears to be working. I read the project subpage and the discussion this idea came from, and I don't see any real discussion of such concerns. Let me know if you can provide more context. I'll try to look into the matter as well. It's early to commit to such a thing, but I think perhaps a RFC may be necessary if this is as new an idea as I think it is. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 09:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll do that. As far as NPOV goes, I think the risk is that the summary will become a POV fork from the main. That's what I have seen happen in a couple of other occasions when there were two versions of one article in the main namespace. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 10:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problem. Honestly, I know very little about RfC at this point other than it can be a good way to get a wider view on a topic. I'll let you know what I dig up. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 18:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Book and Coffee,</p>
<p>I would like to know if you expand on an article; can it be featured&#160;? Must a featured article have no one except yourself as the author&#160;? How can I have my material reviewed and see what the critics think&#160;? I cannot download photos in one of my articles&#160;? I look forward to your response. Thank you.

<dd>Hi Ustye, thanks for the note. Sorry I was so slow to get back to you. Definitely you can get an article featured. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article__91fe.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article?">Wikipedia:What is a featured article?</a> is a good starting point for finding out about the process. One of the key ideas of Wikipedia is collaboration, so don’t worry about being the only author/editor. If this is about the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Typographical_Union_b3ff.html" title="International Typographical Union">International Typographical Union</a> article, I would suggest that you begin with the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_candidates_d0d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article candidates">Wikipedia:Good article candidates</a> process, which is a couple steps away from featured status. There you will find information about expectations, as well as a review process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for loading photos, there is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" rel="nofollow">upload</a> page you can use to load images into articles. You need to pay particular attention to copyright and usage details, but assuming you have permission to use the photos they are certainly a welcome addition to an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Does that answer a few of your questions? Let me know if I can help more. (I’ll try to get back to you quicker as well!) Cheers. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 17:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've noticed you've been making automated substitutions of "trade union" for "labor union". While I appreciate the attention you've shown to categorization, I don't believe that this change is necessarily warranted and is probably inaccurate in the U.S. context. "Trade union" is usually considered as subset of a "labor union", and the equivalent of a <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft_union.html" title="Craft union">craft union</a>. A trade union will represent members of a particular and discrete job, like <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Bridge%2C_Structural%2C_Ornamental_and_Reinforcing_Iron_Workers_5226.html" title="International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers">ironworkers</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Sleeping_Car_Porters_c94d.html" title="Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters">train porters</a>, etc. Most of these unions originate in the old <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_01f4.html" title="AFL">AFL</a> labor federation. The term "trade union" is used in distinction to another kind of labor union, the "<a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_union.html" title="Industrial union">industrial union</a>", which represents members who work in all jobs across an industry, like <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Auto_Workers_1a7e.html" title="United Auto Workers">auto workers</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication_Workers_of_America_705e.html" title="Communication Workers of America">communication workers</a>, etc. Most "industrial unions" were at one time part of the <a href="../../../c/i/o/CIO_d5fe.html" title="CIO">CIO</a>. Neither "trade union" nor "industrial union" is used much in the U.S. context, in favor of the general term "labor union". In fact, the U.S.-"trade union" model is becoming more rare in the U.S. as the old craft unions merge. For all these reasons, it seems somewhat inaccurate to link to the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade union</a> page with every reference. There must be some way to account for the US usage and retain labor union as a larger category, while making it clear neither category represents a worldwide point of view. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Silverfish_b292.html" title="User:DJ Silverfish">DJ Silverfish</a> 22:48, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi DJ Silverfish, thanks for your note. Labor union is indeed the preferred term in the US, but you'll have to be more specific about which changes you are referring to. Unless I have made an error, all the changes I have made recently in the article space have been merely to avoid redirects. There simply isn't an article for "<a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unions.html" title="Labor unions">labor unions</a>" it is just a redirect to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_unions.html" title="Trade unions">trade unions</a>. For example, [[labor union]] is now [[trade union|labor union]]. There should not be any change to the visible text. Please let me know if this is not the case. The other change I have been making is to move historical unions from <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETrade_unions_of_the_United_States_39da.html" title="Category:Trade unions of the United States">Category:Trade unions of the United States</a> to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Category%7EFormer_United_States_labor_unions_6fbd.html" title="Category:Former United States labor unions">Category:Former United States labor unions</a>, but I don't think that is what you are referring to.

<dd>An intersting point. In the British context, <em>'labour unions'</em> would be understood, but would not be normal usage. I am not sure how much this would generally be true outside of the UK. From my expereince (which has its limitations of course) the desrciption <em>'trade union'</em> is the more common. It has the same roots as you describe but its usage has been reinforced by being the description used in legislation so it is well established. Would dual categorisation be a possible answer? We have floated that as a solution to some Caribbean trade unions that are in Latin America but considered part of the Caribbean TU movement (i.e. Guyana, Belize, Suriname).</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is another aspect that has also just occured to me. When we talk of the <em>'Trade Union Movement'</em> we mean trade unions. But once you start talking about the <em>'Labour Movement'</em> it has broader connotations in the British context and would also include the political and co-operative wings of the movement as well as the industrial wing. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriniSocialist_6e5f.html" title="User:TriniSocialist">Dave Smith</a> 03:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yep, it is.</p>
<p>You see I began the category, finding alot of groups that weren't in the earlier Nazi Organizations cat, that I didn't know about. When I realized that there was another cat that was already doing what I had set out to do, then I put the ones that weren't currently included in the earlier one. I'll probably merge them sometime.</p>

<dd>Hi Ling.Nut (rhymes with wing nut?&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's an interesting question. I'm not sure how you could easily detect the intersection between two categories. It can be done within <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> by skipping articles that don't have both cats - but I'd suggest a more mundane method. I only touched the cat because I'm doing some minor category work, but I'm assuming your assessment work is just starting. If it was me I'd just take a more systematic approach of working through all the {{<a href="../../../e/t/h/Template%7EEthnic_groups_825d.html" title="Template:Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a>}} articles and update the tag for all {{<a href="../../../g/r/a/Template%7EGrading_scheme_5ea5.html" title="Template:Grading scheme">Grading scheme</a>}} classes. Does the project have a complete assessment department, or is it a bit ad hoc? I'd suggest fleshing out the whole department; it'll make things easier in the long run.

<p>Hi. You're doing a fine job going through those categories but I'm alarmed at how long it might take you.

<p>Hello " Bookandcoffee ",</p>
<p>You asked for a reference source about my entry to the wikipedia article about the UBC ( United Brotherhood of Carpenters ).</p>
<p>This came from the book&#160;; " WHICH SIDE OUR YOU ON " by Thomas Geoghegan</p>
<p>The book is about the experiences of PRO-LABOR Labor attorney ( Geoghegan ) and his frustrating experiences with the corrupt leadership of Union officials in certain Unions ( in particular the Teamsters and the Carpenters ).</p>
<p>The author documents cases he represented defending rank nd file members. In regards to the Carpenters, he also documents the begings and reasons for the anti-democratic District / Regional Council structure in the Carpenters " union ".</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, you may contact me at unionyes@ameritech.net. My name is David Johnson, I live in Champaign IL.

<p>Both versions are not neutral. One (the original) is postive while the other is negative.

<p>Hi, B&amp;C -- thanks for the hello and a <i>sorry</i> for the "unsigned" entry (I was following the talk and had just read about the importance, and technique/process, of adding missing sigs, so I "practiced" ).</p>
<p>First let me say thankyou for all that you have done getting the labor/labour articles/project developed—I know others have, &amp; will, contributed greatly, but you appear to have made the foundational contributions.</p>
<p>I've been spending most of the past month trying to get the hang of (simple) editing and have been reading everything: Mos, How-to's, Afd's-speedies/contested, talk page reading (article/user), etc. I've also done a smattering of edits, re-direct and link fixes, posted a few questions (don't think I got but the one reply, see below--and I think he's wrong but I haven't tried to follow up yet) etc.</p>
<p>Now I'm beginning to get frustrated with the shear amount of work that can/needs to be done here (as in LabourProject 'here' and Wikipedia 'here') and I don't know where I'll fit in.</p>
<p>Let me just note a few sample items form this area which "get my goat" and which I would like to fix, or have fixed, but don't know where to begin:</p>

<p>Actually, I had seen some of that discussion re: Naming... So, even though I thought it awkward, I was quite willing to standardi(z/s)e usage to <b>Labour</b> &amp; <b>Trade union</b> versus <b>Labor</b> &amp; <b>Labor union</b> for the different reasons you are all too familiar with. Now the outliers in American English seem too weird (even though there are redirects in most instances). I think the present mixed structure will continue to mislead some editors into creating "new" categories &amp; articles under <b>Labor</b>. But, enough of that for now.</p>
<p>I have encountered 2 Re-directs <i><b>Internatinal Labour Organization</b></i> and <i><b>SyndicalisM</b></i> which are clearly simple mis-spellings (intentional or by mistake). They have no incoming links and no history to speak of: the ILO typo was by Rich Farmbrough earlier this year and <b>SyndicalisM'</b>s "<i>history</i>" is 2 lines of text created in 2001 and redirected in 2002! They would seem to be easy candidates for deletion--yet a close reading of the rules at "Wikipedia:Redirects_for_deletion#When_should_we_delete_a_redirect" seems to say I can recommend "ILO" but not the "Syn"--seems we encourage the retention of <i>all possible/ever created</i> (my wording) links because their deletion could break legacy links?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(The NYU catalog had such an authority linking structure for years. Then late last year we had to clean it up for our upcoming migration to a new system and it was a hell to fix those tens of thousands of records--Yes, I was one of those "volunteered" to work on it).</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, what's your experience with this process? Should I try for it--to get some experience--&amp; with your help? Or, should I forget it (assuming that this is difficult/impossible in the current circumstances?</p>
<p>Yes, this is not article building, but I do get bothered by these things and <b>have</b> to do something when I see them! If I believe that I can get some of these things resolved I'll have a better head for the <b>useful</b> work.</p>

<p>Hey RCEberwein, I can shed a little light on the transcluded red-links.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia:WikiProject Organized Labour/Summary is red because the {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArticle_summary_c6bb.html" title="Template:Article summary">Article summary</a>}} is included in the Infobox section on the page, but the summary it would lead to hasn’t been created.</li>
<li><a href="../../../-/i/m/Template%7E-importance.html" title="Template:-importance">Template:-importance</a> is an artifact from the {{ <a href="../../../l/a/b/Template%7ELabourProject_8ee6.html" title="Template:LabourProject">LabourProject</a>}} tag. It shows up on articles that are rated NA. I’m going to dig into it a little, to make sure it’s not out of place, but I think the tag is working properly and the template is the equivalent of an uncalled routine.</li>

<p>Hello Book and Coffee,</p>
<p>I am very upset a person JoshuaZ has decided to block me from using the Wikipedia. I have given articles of schloarship. I am 54 years old and have a Master's Degree in History and Political Science.</p>
<p>I wish you could tell JoshuaZ to remove the block. If he will not remove the block. Then, I will have to follow the appeal process or just give up on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I thank you for talking to JoshuaZ and look forward to him removing the block.</p>

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee,</p>
<p>Once again I'm looking to move an article about a German trade union you started. This time its the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Christian_Workers%27_Federation_0eba.html" title="German Christian Workers' Federation">German Christian Workers' Federation</a>. Using google I can find no non-Wikipedia hits under that name. The correct literal translation of the German name <i>Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund Deutschlands</i> would be "Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany", which gets quite a few hits on google (<a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Trade+Union+Federation+of+Germany%22&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Trade+Union+Federation+of+Germany%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Trade+Union+Federation+of+Germany%22&amp;meta=</a>); a few more can be found under "Christian Union Federation" (<a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Union+Federation%22+German&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Union+Federation%22+German&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Christian+Union+Federation%22+German&amp;meta=</a> some of them are not the German union).

<dd>Grr... you beat me to it! Good work - I was going to work on the merger tonight:) I'll have a look at the ICFTU and WCL pages - the merger field is a bit fussy sometimes.

<dd>I'm not sure why the SD box moved. It "floats" on the right, and I've never figured out exactly what ordering criteria are used for that. I think sometimes it can just be the addition or subtraction of a little text that slightly changes float locations. I actually removed it completely from the article (after changing the bottom org on the list from ICFTU to ITUC) but I see it was put back on the page - oh well, no harm I guess.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 17:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope I won't be out of line to say: I'm not sure I like the way you are going about this. By listing only the new association and removing <i>all mention</i> of the old one, you suppress over 50 years of history. Shouldn't we maintain mention of the old affiliations as historical? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's an interesting issue. I was looking at your edit to the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-CIO_f5ff.html" title="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> and couldn't help wondering - I don't have any problem at all with putting the ICFTU reference in, but it begs the question; should every reference to the ICFTU include an aside that it came out of the <a href="../../../w/f/t/WFTU_6e78.html" title="WFTU">WFTU</a>? Where do you draw the historical line, and to some extent, isn't that what the links are for? I don't think there is any effort to remove <i>all mention</i> of the old structures. Most action has just been a simple substitution, but edits where the language was more complicated, or had a historical connotation, I tried to incorporate both. (eg. <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACILS_755b.html" title="ACILS">ACILS</a>) The AFL-CIO is a good example for this, as it is still woefully small. A proper history of the org would of course include discussion of the ICFTU.</dd>

<p>Hello-</p>
<p>I noticed that you said some kind words about my union label scholarship. I would be happy to help if Wik folks would like. Here is a more current web article that may be useful too - &lt;<a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/~lcushing/UnionLabels/Use_the_union_label.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/~lcushing/UnionLabels/Use_the_union_label.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/~lcushing/UnionLabels/Use_the_union_label.html</a>&gt;</p>

<p>Added to UBC Discussion Page I added the parenthetical reference of 90 million because that was my recollection of the documents I reviewed. There were never any loans to family members the issue that brought Paddy Campbell down was when it became known that Paddy’s son was the investment advisor of one of the failed investments they used the fact that Paddy ordered checks issued to those investors without the Treasurers endorsement to place the blame on him in spite of the fact that the investments were approved by the International Executive Board. (Hammerhabit) The restructuring and the loss of the funds have no connection whatsoever so I added the other parenthetical explaining one of the reasons for the restructuring although there were many survival basis’s for shifting power from the Locals to the Councils, demonstrated now that we are the only building craft union that is growing its membership and many of the other trades are trying to restructure similarly.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>How did Warragamba Dam come to be cited? My understanding was he was flying low over shallow Narrabean Lakes (a Sydney suburb near the coast) early in the morning, while taking the young son of the next door neighbour for a 'joy ride'. Something went wrong. The Bell Ranger helicopter hit the water. The boy got out and so did Byron. Despite being badly injured with a broken back somehow he managed to swim to shore. But as it was winter, with the temperature near freezing, he died of exposure! before help came. The boy survived.</p>
<p>As it happens if he'd crashed into Warragamba Dam, not only is this 60 miles inland, it's very isolated with virtually no access roads around the shoreline. The Bell would have sunk in deep water and nobody would have found anything for days or weeks.</p>
<p>I learned of this tragedy while in the office of the manager of Warner Bros in Paris, Wayne Duband (an Australian). Someone called him from Sydney, told him the news (and the details aforesaid) and ruined our day, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>If you had reservations about the post from Andrea Kennedy-Frost, forget them. I've been in contact with her. From what I personally know about Byron and Dr. George Miller's early days in Melbourne, Andrea provides details only a family member could. Like the minivan (which I have been in with George and Byron). No question she's Byron's sister and her information is valuable biographical material.</p>

<p>there are very few vendors who offer the high efficiency cells, where do you get the number of "hundreds" of cell vendors? Most of the cell vendors have very low efficiency, the Spectrolab cells are the highest on the market that I have seen.. It is not an advert as I have no connection with the vendor.

<dd>Hi Richard, I think your first instinct to just remove the rating is good. Looking at the history it would be my guess that the rating was slipped in as a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<p>This is an honourary invitation, extended simply because my experience at Organized Labour has been such a pleasure and gave me the final nudge to create the maritime trades project. Well, there is another reason: the Organized Labour project is so neatly, well, organized, that I, um, borrowed huge chunks of explanatory text and functionality. Fortunately, property is theft, so it all works out in the end. :) Cheers. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaus42_9a14.html" title="User:Haus42">Haus42</a> 15:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey thanks Haus. I'd be glad to get involved with the project - however, given that I grew up over 1000 miles from the ocean, and have been on exactly one sailboat in my life (plus the ferry from Vancouver to Victoria a bunch of times!) I'm afraid my membership will be restricted to land based activities like marine unions and labour disputes! Oh, and as for giving me the credit for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/WP%7EUNION_76bd.html" title="WP:UNION">WP:UNION</a> layout? Well, (cough), it was mostly stolen along the way as well. Thanks for your excellent job in setting up the portal, we can really use someone with your talents around here.

<dd>Hi Dave, yeah it seems to just be sitting there doesn't it. I haven't done anything with it for some time, and I'm a little reluctant to expand it. What do you think? There has been no activity in trying to actually translate anything over at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Organized_Labour_Internationalisation_7d36.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Organized Labour/Internationalisation">Wikipedia:WikiProject Organized Labour/Internationalisation</a>, (and I'm embarrassed to say that I can offer no skills in that area.) Maybe it makes more sense to just have the tag on the article page and the text more static on the internationalisation page? Or maybe it's just an idea that isn't going to fly?--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 16:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
