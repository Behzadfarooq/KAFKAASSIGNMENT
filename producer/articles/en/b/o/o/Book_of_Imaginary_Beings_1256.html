The English edition, created in collaboration with translator Norman Thomas de Giovanni, contains descriptions of 120 <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legendary_creature.html" title="Legendary creature">mythical beasts</a> from <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> and literature. In the Preface, Borges states that the book is to be read 'as with all miscellanies...not...straight through...rather we would like the reader to dip into the pages at random, just as one plays with the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope'; and that 'legends of men taking the shapes of animals' have been ommitted.</p>
