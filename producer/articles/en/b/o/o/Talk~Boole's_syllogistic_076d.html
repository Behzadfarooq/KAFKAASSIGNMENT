<p><b>OPPOSE:</b></p>
<p>I'll recap the comments I left at the talk page for StuRat's article.</p>
<p>First, while this article could stand a rewrite, if "Boolean logic" does in fact refer to a simplification of Aristotelean syllogistic by allowing <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuously_true.html" title="Vacuously true">vacuous truth</a>, that's important enough for an article (and by the way does not seem to be all that closely related to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a>, contrary to the notice at the top).</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, WP is not the place to start a language reform. "Boolean logic" is a better name than "Boolean algebra" for the logical calculus, but it's not what people actually call it, or at least not usually. So I think we're stuck with parenthesized versons of "Boolean algebra", much as we might not wish it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:28, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>OPPOSE</b></p>
<p>I agree with Travatore. But I wish some logicians would respond to this issue. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Chareles Stewart's</a> is the the local expert in the field I think. I would especially like to hear his opinion. Unfortunately he hasn't been around for the last month or so. By the way I think that StuRat has done an excellent job on this article, even if I don't like the name. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">â˜Ž</a> 16:00, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the compliment. I would like a clarification of your position.

<dd>You are welcome. Yes to be more clear, I had forgotten which talk page I was on, so I was complimenting you on the article at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>. And yes I think that <i>this</i> article "Boole's syllogistic" should probably be moved back. I don't know what the other article should be called but I think it should be probably be called "Boolean algebra (<i>something</i>)". If I had to pick a name now it would be "Boolean algebra (logic)". But like I said above I would like the opinion of a logician like Charles. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">â˜Ž</a> 17:59, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. "Boolean algebra (logic)" isn't a bad suggestion, but it's pretty close to "Boolean logic". Do you think someone looking up "Boolean logic" would rather see the material under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boole%27s_syllogistic.html" title="Boole's syllogistic">Boole's syllogistic</a> than the material currently under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>&#160;? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 18:12, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I am not a logician. And I'm not particularly familiar with the history and usage of the term "Boolean logic". As Travator points out above the term may more usually refer to a simplification of Aristotelean syllogistic. As I've said twice before, I would like to know what more knowledgable editors have to say. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">â˜Ž</a> 19:07, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Paul August mailed me, so here I am...</p>
<p>I'm far from an expert on Boole's logic, but I've at least read some and attended a few talks where Boole's work was discussed, so at least I have an informed ignorance. Two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boole did not propose a separate syllogistic calculus, rather what he proposed was an interpretation of syllogistic into his algebra. There are a few accounts of the interpretation on the web, of which Stanley Burris' <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/MYWORKS/SYLL/syll.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/MYWORKS/SYLL/syll.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Fragment of Boole's Algebraic Logic Suitable for Traditional Syllogistic Logic</a> is perhaps the best.</li>
<li>The current article is talking about how this interpretation proposes a resolution to the problem of existential import (see <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_of_opposition.html" title="Square of opposition">square of opposition</a>), one incompatible with Aristotle assertions. One of the many problems with the article as it stands is that it isn't clear that that is what it is doing. I suppose no one else is going to fix it but me: I'll get around to it...</li>
<li>Naturally this calculus is propositional logic and not predicate logic. The embedding of syllogsitic into propositional logic shows that syllogistic corresponds to a very weak fragment of predicate logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't think <i>Boole's syllogistic</i> is a good title for this: first it suggest Boole proposed a syllogistic system, and second the material doesn't stand too well apart from a discussion of the logic proper. There's a reasonable case for putting this material in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boole_832a.html" title="George Boole">George Boole</a> article, but my preference is for a separate article, perhaps called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Laws_of_Thought_34f5.html" title="The Laws of Thought">The Laws of Thought</a>, which would be freer to get into the technicalities of later discussions. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:30, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
