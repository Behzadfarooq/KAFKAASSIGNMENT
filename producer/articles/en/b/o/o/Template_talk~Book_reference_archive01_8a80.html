<h2><span class="mw-headline">The template doesn't follow Wikipedia standard (such as they are) and fits only the very simplest cases.</span></h2>
<p>Check <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite_sources</a>.</p>
<p>The template does not follow the recommendations there which are the ones I have been using. MLA style and similar styles are now very widely used in both literary and scientific articles.</p>
<p>Also, I again and again cite material from books that have editors rather than authors. Translators sometimes need to be mentioned (and translators of sections of a book are sometimes different from the editors of a book). Illustrators are also important (sometimes the reason that the work is being cited is the illustrator). Then there is the matter of noting particular editions or providing reprint information. There is the matter of ISBN numbers. There are somtimes re-releases of a book under a different title or even contemporary release of the same work under different titles. Some academic books are part of a continuing series and the series name should be mentioned.</p>
<p>See for example the references I recently added to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_mythology.html" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a> which contain entry after entry that just won't fit this template. And that bibliography contains no individual articles. Individual articles within a book or periodical add futher difficulties.</p>
<p>The idea of a list of templates for every reference likely to be cited numerous times is a very good one, but such a template needs to be far more flexible and complete than this one is (or there needs to be a set of templates for various uses). And templates should agree with the suggested formats in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite_sources</a> or the suggestions there should be changed. I don't think they should be changed.</p>
<p>Sorting material by author and date and using author name and date as the in-text reference is the most reader-friendly method for in-text reference which is why it has caught on so widely for academic use.</p>
<p>The idea of having bibilographic information in one place for a reference is a good one, but needs much more work before it is practical for anything but the very simplest cases. Probably someone with a lot of bibliographic and library cataloguing experience should work on this.</p>
<p>A template containing only the <i>minimum</i> <a href="../../../b/i/b/BibTeX_fe06.html" title="BibTeX">BibTeX</a> fields is not suitable for real world use.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have now updated the template to get it close to MLA. Note that it still requires the authors string to be input precisely to get the right author layout. To get round this issue we would have to have templates Template:Book_ref_1_author ... Template:Book_ref_5_authors. On the face of it, this would be reasonable - however when combined with the need for other templates outlined below, it cause the number of required templates to grow exponentially.</dd>

<dd>This is all good stuff. The "editors" case is extremely common, and I think we should proliferate the templates to allow for that. I think perhaps we should also allow a "further information" parameter which can be populated with illustrator, translator information as required. There is a question of whether "close to MLA" is good enough of course in that case.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other initial feedback</span></h2>
<p>This is a good start! I've had in mind a scheme to make Bib:xyz entries recorded in a separate table in the database, so the bibliography could be searchable and shareable a la images, but that's a lot of hacking... a set of templates like this is a good bridge. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 20:53, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>While still simple, I think this is a great big step in the right direction. Not only will it make citations easier, which encourages adding them, but more importantly it creates a standardized format which can be changed easily. I would recommend retrofitting all existing book references with such a template once it's stabilized. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Derrick Coetzee</a> 03:37, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bibliography Creator</span></h2>
<p>If we can create a single dynamic template, I have the makings of an open-source Bibliography Creator on my website, found <a href="http://br1an.net/MLA/book.html" class="external text" title="http://br1an.net/MLA/book.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (I didn't code it, but the original author's website is down). It's javascript, so presumably a developer could just embed it into something like Wikipedia:Bibliography creator.</p>
<p>I will also shoot this idea over to the guy who is doing the coding for the Firefox Wikipedia extension and see if he could implement it there. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 21:32, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have you noticed that if you do not complete all fields the template shows missing field in the reference. Also if you put field_name= it shows a redundant point. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite style="font-style:normal">Sussex, John (editor) (1990). <i>Stamp World London 90, souvenir handbook</i>, Stamp World Exhibitions.</cite></li>

<p>I reverted <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">User:Rdsmith4</a>'s changes of today because they broke articles that use this template. This is a very commonly used template, and thus is a dependency of a lot of pages out there. We shouldn't break it lightly, and if we do break it by changing its interface in an incompatible manner, we must be willing to fix the articles that are broken by the change. Preferably, considering the wide-ranging consequences of breaking the interface to commonly used templates, these changes should be discussed first ... <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 06:32, Jan 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> makes a difference between bibliography format and reference list format. In bibliography format, the year comes at the end, as above. In reference list format, the year comes between author and title. In theoretical linguistics publications, at least, we always always <i>always</i> use reference list format. The difference between a bibliography and reference list is that a reference list includes only works actually cited in the article; a bibliography contains all works that might be of interest. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><big>탉</big></a> 20:03, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For those who think that "Author (Year) Title..." should be preferred to</p>

<p>I suggest to check at <i>any</i> moment the <b>reference list</b> of the most recently added article in <i>any</i> of the subjects (physics, mathematics, computer science, biology...) found at the world wide largest preprint server <a href="../../../a/r/x/Arxiv.html" title="Arxiv">arxiv</a> (15ooo connections/hour w/o counting mirrors; more than 100 new articles/day), e.g.</p>

<dd>Um, with whom are you arguing? The article explicitly says that there are many citation formats, and that the one given is just an example for those people who aren't familiar with one, and that other styles are also acceptable. (For my part, I'm used to the style used in the hard sciences and engineering, which is neither the APA nor the MLA style and doesn't put last name first.) We don't <i>really</i> care what format people use, as long as they include the information.

<p>I checked one CS article from arxiv and noticed that the citation form is also different from what is standard in linguistics. Linguistics papers always cite the reference thus: (Smith 2005), whereas the paper I checked (and I know from experience a lot of papers in hard sciences) cite the reference thus: [1]. In the first method the references list is then listed in alphabetical order by author's last name, which is immediately followed by the date. In the second menthod the references list is listed in order of first mention. Since I mostly edit linguistics articles here I like to follow the conventions linguists are accustomed to. People who write on other sciences will presumably also prefer to follow the conventions their colleagues are accustomed to. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 15:22, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's really the core issue: Wikipedia articles encompass a great variety of disciplines, and adherents of the various disciplines will advocate their preferred citation style over others. (I've already reverted this template when it appears in history articles, and probably will continue to do so, since it seems so "wrong".) A single Wikipedia "house style" seems unlikely to emerge anytime soon. I've considered making a "history book" reference template; perhaps a variety of citation/reference templates would be helpful, with advice on which one to use for the various disciplines. This approach might create a bit more consistency, while keeping the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_retentive.html" title="Anal retentive">anal retentive</a> types (i.e. me) happy. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 17:33, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The logical decision is to support every single citation style there is and let the editor use their discretion as to which is the most appropriate. If done properly, this means that it is something that only has to be done one time, because citation formats are nearly permanent. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 02:00, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">extraction out into subparts</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to extract some parts of these as subparts. For example, if we ever were to change the Year, as I tried before, I'd want the change automatically propagated to the other similar templates. Similarly for the "publisher ID", which could be a subpart. This is even more important in the new things I created: Chapter Reference, Book Reference Link, and Chapter Reference Link. There is a large amount of code duplicated among these three, and I <b>really</b> want to subpart it.</p>
<p>Is there a standard for creating subtemplates (i.e. subparts)? Do we just go ahead and create a Template and use it, and pick some reasonable name? At the very least we need to pick a standard for naming subpart templates.</p>

<p>OK, I went ahead and created a demo of this. I have a few templates named 'Section:...' and I'm using them for common template parts that are shared among one or more templates, so that changes need be made only once rather than propagated. I've done similar things for the following templates: 'Book reference link', 'Chapter reference', 'Chapter reference link'. It's true that it typically doesn't save space in the template definitions, at least for simple ones like these; but it saves a good deal of headache, esp. over a larger tree of templates, as it allows for consistent propagation of changes.</p>

<dd>However, it is now clear that this new "Biblio"-feature (a Bibliography in an author's article) – if at all – should only be implemented for the First,Last variant of the template. A very nice implementation would be if we imposed that First,Last should *always* be specified but inside the template we could *detect* that it is instantiated in an author's article (I don't know if this is technically possible) and then suppress the display of First,Last. If that detection mechanism is impossible to implement, we could, as a last resort, add (yet) another parameter which serves as a flag. What about "biblio" (i.e. {{Book reference|biblio=yes...}})? — Adrian | Talk <strike>12:53, 17 November 2005</strike> 08:03, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most citation styles end citations with a full stop, presumably following grammatical customs of ending a textual segment. It seems better to have the template not also generally require addition of a full stop, so I am restoring it. As the format of templates can change, text around a template call should be phrased to not be dependent upon the template so starting a new sentence following this template seems like a good idea.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Eliminating variant First, Last</span></h2>
<p>I would like to propose to eliminate the variant First,Last (FL) and to use only the Author variable. I've just done (only) a (very) quick sample and could not find any single applied actual use of this template in the variant FL. I do see a chance to simplify things by eliminating FL as soon as possible. In the first step, I propose to deprecate FL in the documentation (on this page) as soon as possible and then try to do a thorough search to count the exact uses. We could then take a final decision based on the statistics. If the consensus would be to do the elimination, we could then change all existing uses of FL to Author and when done delete FL from template and doc. If the consensus would be *not* to do the elimination, we could just undo the deprecation. Opinions? — Adrian | Talk 23:43, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. First,Last are being used in many other citation templates and should be available for compatibility. As with the other templates, identification of First and Last names allows consistent formatting of citations.

<dd>I think one-author-books should not be treated different from multi-author-books. The one-author-book case should just be one application of the multi-author-book. Also, author names do not only consist of First, Last. Many do have two first names, often abbreviated by an initial (but in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_example_style_402d.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources/example style">Wikipedia:Cite sources/example style</a>: <i>"A good guideline is to list author names as they are written in the original article/book, without using any abbreviations."</i>) (example: Robert Cecil Martin). Other authors do use other additions, like Jr. (example: Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. (1995). <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mythical_Man-Month_8c0b.html" title="The Mythical Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a></i>). And how do we support "consistent formatting" among multi-author-books? One of the reason that motivated me to propose elimination of FL was that it is quite hard to find all occurences in articles, something that would be easy with a separate template (e.g. "Book reference single author" or whatever). But I don't like the idea of an arsenal of book templates. However, I'm not obsessed to my proposal. If you prefer to keep the FL variant, then that's ok. — Adrian | Talk 10:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes (my email is on my user page). But thanks for the log scan. However what's interesting is that if we take all articles starting with letter A that use Book reference (26) there are just 3 that use FL (according to your list). That's 12% of the articles beginning with the letter A that use Book reference are also using FL. If we take the actual uses of each instance of Book reference, that ratio will even be lower. Of course that was only letter A. I know that I cannot infer from that to other letters. But anyway, I will stop here. Please excuse me if I was too persisting. I just couldn't follow your arguments. I really appreciate the template as it is. — Adrian | Talk 22:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No particular opinion on the issue at hand, but I have used FL in a few articles. Might it be wise to add an optional "Middle" (assuming we keep FL)?

My thanks go to <a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a>, who added a new parameter "Coauthors" to the template and updated the documentation.

The First,Last variant with the new "Coauthors" parameter is now a full replacement for the now deprecated Author variant, also for the case of multi-author-books. For multi-author-books, the most prominent author (which is also the one that serves as the address of the reference together with the year of the book) should be placed in First,Last while all additional authors should be added to the new "Coauthors".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chapter URL required</span></h2>
<p>Something I just noticed on editing <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnobius.html" title="Arnobius">Arnobius</a> — URL always puts the link on Title, i.e., on the book itself, in this case <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>. IMHO, while this is good as a default, since Title is mandatory and Chapter is not (I use Chapter for Article, as appropriate and necessary), I think it would be A Good Thing to have some option for putting a URL on the Chapter instead or in addition. Best thing I could think of would be (yet another) optional argument, such as ChapterURL — this would allow a link to the chapter in question in books where the online version gives each chapter its own page, while also allowing the URL field to provide a link to the top-level of the book itself, which is what I, as a reader, would expect to get from clicking on a linked Title. I would just <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Be Bold</a> and do it if this template weren't already complex beyond my ability to edit confidently; I don't want to break it while people are using it.

Maybe you could also run the regression tests (Template talk:Book reference/regression tests) under your user space before submitting here. It might also be useful to create a non-protected development branch of this template and work exclusively there, and then let an admin (you?) copy stable versions (i.e. releases) into <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> to minimize changes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Double-period bug</span></h2>
<p>When the publisher ends with a period, e.g., "Inc.", this template adds a redundant period after it. It may have the same problem with other fields, though I haven't checked it out. The template is a nice idea, but until it is fixed to stop this goofy behavior, it is of somewhat limited use. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydrargyrum_f7da.html" title="User:Hydrargyrum">Quicksilver</a><sup><a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydrargyrum_66d7.html" title="User talk:Hydrargyrum">T</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Hydrargyrum_9de5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum">@</a></sup> 22:19, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AFAICT, the only viable fix for this is user education; I will note it in the Usage section. Allowance must be made for the final period regardless of whether the Publisher should end with one, or whether Publisher is included at all, since that's an optional argument. <b>Edit:</b> Just noticed that, if you follow the instructions under Usage, in accord with most citation styles (including MLA and Chicago if memory serves) Inc., PLC, LLC, &amp;c. should <b>not</b> be included in the citation to begin with.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please comment: usefulness and viability of multiple output formats?</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_example_style_402d.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources/example style">Wikipedia:Cite sources/example style</a> says, "<b>please use the citation style of your choice</b>" (original emphasis), and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> says, "If available and unquestioned, follow the <i>established practice</i> for the appropriate profession or discipline" (original emphasis). There are a number of standards of equal merit in varying disciplines, many of which are covered in various topic area of Wikipedia. I'm wondering about the viability of expanding the template to allow for any of them, or at least any of the common ones.</p>
<p>It seems that the recent effort to consolidate on a single template for all books is worthwhile, meritorious, and largely successful, if still a work in progress. It would be a shame to have things forking again in the future as disputer arise under the above-referenced policies as one group writing in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> insists on APA style, while the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">sciences</a> insist on Chicago, and the academics pine for {{<a href="../../../h/a/r/Template%7EHarvard_reference_bd68.html" title="Template:Harvard reference">Harvard reference</a>}}. With the addition of one more optional argument (and, yes, a mountain of code) I think this template could serve everyone equally, since every citation style is including essentially the same information and simply formatting it differently for display.</p>
<p>For example, with the addition of an argument <code>style</code>, which takes values such as <code>MLA APA Chicago Harvard</code>, the template could provide a top-level if-nest based on the existence and value of that parameter, and format the reference in accord with the related organization's dictates. This would also simplify the matter if, say, a reference was originally created with APA style, and the community consensus in that subject area is that Chicago should be used instead: just change that one param, and <i>bingo</i>, there's your change.</p>
<p>I think I'm beginning to understand how this template functions now, so if there's any interest in seeing this, I could do a mock-up in my user space within the next week or so. Thank you in advance for your input, pro and con. --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">KGF0</a> ( <a href="../../../k/g/f/User_talk%7EKgf0_c3a9.html" title="User talk:Kgf0">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kgf0_ae94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kgf0">C</a> ) 23:07, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find this idea quite nice. A proposal: one template (let's assume that's Book reference) that contains the implementation logic and has a new <code>style</code> paramater (as you wrote). But then don't let users instantiate Book reference everywhere in articles. Instead, create new front-end templates like "Book reference MLA", "Book reference APA", "Book reference Chicago" and "Book reference Harvard" (or other names whatever) that just delegate to "Book reference" and set the new <code>style</code> paramater of Book reference accordingly and just forward all other parameters to Book reference. That way it, it would be easy to find the different variants in articles. – Adrian | Talk 01:24, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Addendum: Use for the name of the implementation template "Book reference implementation" (or similar): intentionally long to write so that users won't take it by accident. And, that name should be different from "Book reference". <b>Edit 01:59, 19 November 2005 (UTC):</b> The contents of Book reference (as it stands now) should be moved to the new "Book reference implementation". "Book reference" (exact name) should then be demoted to a front-end template (i.e. the <strike>"old"</strike> "default" variant). – Adrian | Talk 01:37, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why not start the mockup at "Template:Book reference implementation" right away (instead of in your user space)? We (you) could copy the contents of Book reference to there and we would have an own decoupled playground for the start (with the luxory of an own discussion space). And if it should fail, we do not hurt gurus nor users here (just TfD as needed). Book reference is used in more than 3'500 articles. So, we should know what we are doing... – <strike>02:34, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</strike> – Adrian | Talk 00:53, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent edits have totally killed the appearance of the template. I reverted to an old version that looked right.

<dd>The problem is that the change was made because every single instance where the <b>{{{Editor}}}</b> parameter is used shows <b>{{{Editor}}}</b> jammed right up against <b>{{{Title}}}</b>. I was attempting to insert some white-space between the optional <b>{{{Editor}}}</b> parameter and the mandatory <b>{{{Title}}}</b> parameter in such a way that it would only manifest itself when <b>{{{Editor}}}</b> was defined. As far as I could see my change worked fine, and none of the (many) other instances of the template in the various articles I checked appeared broken (never mind "completely killed"). Please supply details of what was actually wrong, and how you intend to accommodate the changes necessary to fix the problem I was trying to solve before you reverted. —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 13:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
