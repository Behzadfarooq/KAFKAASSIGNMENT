	    <p>I edited this page because the previous article neglected to present the traditional use of the Book of Shadows. Hopefully, the article will now better explain the Book of Shadows in both the traditional and neo-Wiccan contexts.</p>

<p><br />
I would like to move the definition relating to traditional Wicca (Gardnerian, Alexandrian, etc.) to the top of the article - the usage of the term 'book of shadows' for a journal is a quite recent innovation, and although this usage is becoming reasonably common, many experienced practitioners (of both traditional and non-traditional Wicca or Neopaganism) still consider this to be an incorrect or untraditional usage. Does anyone object?</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, I thought I had replied to you some time ago. I must never have submitted my comments. The BoS holds certain rituals and materials of the tradition, and in several common branches of initiatory Wicca, it is not altered by the initiate. I've just read that in the early days of the Bricket Wood Coven, Gardner told coveners that they could add or remove what they wanted from their books, however later initiates (who seeded larger family trees) were under the impression that the material should not be altered.</dd>
<dd>The BoS also serves other purposes which I am not at liberty to explain. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 00:03, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to know more about the "Book of Mirrors." I've tried searching it, but I haven't found much. I would like to know the origins, a more in-depth definition of its purpose, and if it's just as important as the book of shadows.</p>

<dd>I think it was probably Scott Cunningham who came up with this innovation, though I'm not sure. It is simply a book of personal reflections. Its name also brings to mind "magic mirrors", and presumably it is intended to be used in a similar way. "Magic mirrors" are traditionally (not in Wiccan tradition per se, but in wider Western Magical tradition) black and white. The black mirror is a list of personal failings, faults and flaws compiled as honestly as possible by the operator and kept up to date throughout magical training. The white mirror is a similarly honest list of positive attributes.</dd>
<dd>The Book of Mirrors presumably is intended to be written in the same spirit of honesty. It is in no way a traditional concept, although students would normally be expected to keep personal notes. I see it as just a pretty name for the collection of notes that one would inevitably be making anyway. The BoS however serves quite different (and not entirely obvious) purposes. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 20:22, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I presume there's nothing stopping anyone making something called a "Book of Mirrors". It's just an invented concept, and there's no such thing in Wiccan tradition, so I'm not going to tell you you're doing it wrong. If you want to know more about how it was intended to be used, you'd have to track down the author who invented the concept, and read about it. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 03:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would you happen to know where I could find that material? It sounds like an interesting read.</dd>
<dd>To me it sounds as if the Book of Mirrors was intended for a Wiccan to see what was in themselves through their writings and to show them their faults, and where they needed to go next in their studies....am I wrong in this assumtion?<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolon89_28c6.html" title="User:Solon89">Solon Olrek</a> 18:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What is this, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_method.html" title="Socratic method">Socratic questioning</a>? I'm afraid you'll have to do your own search and find what works for you. As far as I'm concerned it has nothing to do with the Book of Shadows, nothing to do with Wicca, and very little importance to this article. I've given you some possibilities for where to start looking, and those plus google should answer all your questions.

<p>The article in the beginning presents the Book of Shadows as the religious text of Wicca, while later it says that it is like a journal for Wiccans, which is the truth. In fact the Book of Shadows is a both personal and religious book that every Wiccan optionally has, and writes in it what they feel like writing. <a href="../../../t/e/o/User%7ETeo64x_63e9.html" title="User:Teo64x">Teo64x</a> 17:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd just like to add that what I said above can be read in the links given at the bottom of the page. So, in fact, the article seems to contradict its sources. I'm not an expert on Wicca so I hope the corrections (if needed) will be done by someone else. <a href="../../../t/e/o/User%7ETeo64x_63e9.html" title="User:Teo64x">Teo64x</a> 18:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll check that the article reflects this clearly, but in fact the term "Book of Shadows" has at least two rather different meanings, as used by different groups. In lineaged forms of Wicca, such as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardnerian_Wicca_d535.html" title="Gardnerian Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrian_Wicca_99f4.html" title="Alexandrian Wicca">Alexandrian Wicca</a>, the Book of Shadows is the religious text of the tradition. Some groups never add or remove; some groups do occasionally add to the book. However in modern <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclectic_Wicca_9523.html" title="Eclectic Wicca">eclectic Wicca</a> (which many lineaged Wiccans would contend is not actually Wicca) the Book of Shadows is more often a personal journal. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 04:57, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pagan Is me 04:17, 6 April 2007 (UTC)==Making a book of shadows== There isn't really a wrong way about it, some witchs use a three ring binders and while others use a "notebook" as their book of shadows. I use a notebook cause its easy to carry around. heres how I made my own.</p>
<p>First you need a notebook and then you write (book of shadows) on the front cover, and draw pentacle down bottom. call me old fashion but I like it this way cause I want my pages stay were they are and not change anything. while others used wood and lether as there front and back. theres also download your own book of shadows, I gotta warn you now those don't work. you MUST put your enrgies into the book of shadows..NOT the online one. just a heads up. when you add your index heres afew things you can add.</p>
<p><b>Herbs-page 1</b> Potions-page 2 History-page 3 Spells-page 4 Chants-page 5 Pendulums-page 6 Tarot-page 7 Symbols-page 8 Signs-page 9 Gemstones-page 10 Rune stones-page 11 Moon terms-page 12 Gods-page 13 Godesses-page 14 Festivals-page 15</p>
<p><br />
These are just some ideas. when you add info on each pages its a good idea to add a number to a page (see list) thats only an example.</p>
<p>Good luck with your book of shadows! Pagan Is me 04:17, 6 April 2007 (UTC)Pagan_Is_me</p>
