<p>I think this section needs to be removed, or at least seriously modified. The section is written based on the incorrect idea that the Book of Mormon claims that the Book of Mormon peoples are the main ancestors of today's American Indians. It is a common assumption of both the book's supporters and detractors that the Book of Mormon peoples lived throught America. The book itself is decidely unspecific on the location of its events. Common logic and archaeological evidence suggest that these events occurred in a much smaller geographical area, likely in Central America.</p>
<p>Obviously, a relatively small group living in a small area, which reportedly fell into decline, would not provide a large portion of the gene pool modern American Indians draw from. Therefore, whether American Indian DNA matches Hebrew DNA is of no consequence.</p>
<p>Also, the section states "Nevertheless, critics say that the narrative does not explicitly mention other groups present in the Americas." This part of the section is, at best, confusing. What is meant by "other groups"? If, by this, the author means "groups other than the book's primary subjects, the Nephites and the Lamanites," then the statement is incorrect. The book explicitly mentions two other groups, the Mulekites and the Jaredites. If, on the other hand, the statement suggests that the book does not mention "any groups living in the Americas other than those mentioned in the book"...well...yeah. Obviously, the only groups mentioned in the book will be the ones mentioned in the book.</p>
<p>Before making changes, though, I thought this ought to be brought up here.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheaust_359e.html" title="User:Cheaust">Cheaust</a> 17:19, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not strictly true (if I'm understanding you right), Wiki:Categorization also says "However there are occasions when this guideline can and should be ignored." I believe that since "sacred history" isn't exclusively a "religious text" subcategory... this isn't exactly "cut and dried" here, perhaps some other editors can comment? <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 01:13, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The beginning of this section frankly does not belong here. Any claim to contain the "fullness of the gospel", infallabillity or completeness was never made anywhere in the part of the Book of Mormon we have that I could find. Quite the contrary in fact. Moroni freely admits that their might even be mistakes in the book(see the TitlePage). Also, the majority of the book was "sealed up" (<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/ether/3/22#22" class="external autonumber" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/ether/3/22#22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Ether 3:22) until the world was ready to receive them. Why would they be sealed up if they contained nothing new? As mentioned before, the Book of Mormon never claims to contain the fullness of the gospel, therefore it cannot contain a contradiction to the gospel. The Doctrine and Covenants does make this claim, but even so, who knows what was on the sealed portion? The introduction is NOT considered part of the Mormon canon of scriptures, and was written millenia after the Book of Mormon claimed to be finished. Therefore, it cannot be cited as a reference. If nobody can come up with a good reason to keep the first paragraph or so, speak up or I will delete it shortly. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpachamo_69f9.html" title="User:Epachamo">Epachamo</a> 02:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure the phrase "fullness of the gospel" comes from a Joseph Smith Jr. quote, though I'm not sure what the context was - but just because a certain amount of information is called the "fullness of the gospel" by latter day saints doesn't mean that they believe there is no other informatino of relevence. Indeed, most Latter Day Saints believe very strongly in an open cannon of scripture.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For Mormons the "fullness of the gospel" does not refer to every doctrinal tenet and idea of the religion, but to the steps one must follow in order to obtain exaltation, i.e. faith, repentance, baptism, holy ghost, endure to the end.Primalscreamtherapy 02:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Fullness of the gospel" is a misleading phrase, if you do not understand the context of the word "gospel". Gospel means the good news of Christ, and not the doctrines or even the practices of the church. It should be explained or scrapped, but at the very least referenced. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 22:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd like to correct the above, "fullness of the gospel" means all steps leading to salvation, not exaltation, in mormonism. <a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrad_81c2.html" title="User:Wrad">Wrad</a> 22:04, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I understand it, the main difference between the two versions is one of chapter and verse allocation, but it is such a severe difference as to make chapter and verse references cited by one group make no sense to the other group.</p>
<p>So, somebody needs to get some RLDS/LDS chapter and verse conversion tables on the internet, and this article should link to them. Would that information would be appropriate as a wikipedia article?</p>
<p>Do any RLDS/CoC historians know why the RLDS Church used a different chapter and versification in their 1908 (or earlier editions) than the 1879 model done by Orson Pratt for the LDS editions? I note that The Church of Jesus Christ (with headquarters in Monongahela, Pennsylvania) has used the Pratt model for a long time. Were they trying to assert their independence or had the LDS threatened them with copyright infringement?Russellane 07:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)Russel Lane</p>

<p>To consider Smith as the author of The Book of Mormon would make him one of the foremost authors of his day, since this work widely read around the world. One of Smith's contemporaries, James Fenimore Cooper, published The Last of the Mohicans in 1826, four years before Smith's work. Similar to the Book of Mormon, Cooper's work deals with Native Americans, however, it is not nearly so comprehensive in dealing with civilizations and military maneuvers in the way the Book of Mormon does. Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays, while dealing with philosophy and ethics, were published years after the Book of Mormon and took ten years to write, while Smith claims to have written his work in mere months. Nathanial Hawthorne, born one year before Smith, did not publish The Scarlet Letter until 1850, twenty years after Smith's Book of Mormon. If Smith did indeed write the work, he has certainly been denied a rightful place in the study of American Literature; the study of The Book of Mormon in academic circles would, at the very least, allow modern criticism of a work that is significant in its relevance to the early 19th century religious and philosophical ideas in America.--Dncstevens 17:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should have been more specific. I have never heard of the convention of dropping articles from the titles of religious texts and not from works of fiction. If there is let me know, and I apologize. It seems more likely after reading the section <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28definite_and_indefinite_articles_at_beginning_of_name%29_2c0c.html#When_definite_and_indefinite_articles_should_be_used" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (definite and indefinite articles at beginning of name)">When definite and indefinite articles should be used</a>, that the article is dropped when it is not used in the title in the original language (As I suspect is the case with "Torah" and "Bible"). Since we don't really know how they did it with Reformed Egyptian, Wikipedia guidelines say to go off the translations. Since we only have one translation, and the article IS used in that translation, we should use it in the title of our article. <i>That</i> it seems is the precedent. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpachamo_69f9.html" title="User:Epachamo">Epachamo</a> 18:54, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I will not support nor vote against this move, but recuse myself in this instance. It was tried once before and the move failed due to the article policy cited above. If you can't get it changed for the legal name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you'll have a harder time with the Book of Mormon. I agree with keeping where it is due to encyclopedic standards, but would support a move of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. There are no doctrinal issues with it in either place, as there are with the name of the church, and simply doesn't really matter.

<li><b>Oppose</b> per Visorstuff's reasoning. I understand the logic in adding "The" to the beginning, but don't really think there's a need to make a change that, in the end, isn't really that necessary and would require changing an enormous amount of links so they don't point at the redirect.

<li><b>Oppose</b> per Stormrider and Lethargy below - the churches that use it seem to flip-flop on the "the", and keeping no "the" is more likely to match searches for it. Besides, do we really know whether "<a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Egyptian_0854.html" title="Reformed Egyptian">Reformed Egyptian</a>" used definite articles? English is somewhat peculiar in its mania for definite articles everywhere, and languages written with logographs rather than alphabets seem especially prone to omitting them - so, assuming the reality of the Book of Mormon, I don't think it would have used anything translated as "the" in its original title. It would have been an anglicizing touch by Joseph, along with all the other anglicizing he did, according to LDS apologists. I don't know of any authoritative statements by the Brethren on the doctrinal importance of the "the". - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">w:s</a>)</font></small> 08:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This may not be as straightforward as I had originally thought. Although the cover of the book shows "The Book of Mormon", it seems the "the" may be there purely for aesthetic reasons. First, the spine of a combination BoM/PoGP/D&amp;C/Bible lists it as simply "Book of Mormon". Second, you can see <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents" rel="nofollow">here</a> that the "The" is on a separate line from "Book of Mormon".

<dd>People, I am ambivalent about this issue. Titles are important to me to identify article topics and to facilitate searches. I believe that most adults would look up <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a>. Youths might first search for "The Book of Mormon", but would sill find it.

<p>DW: This entry makes me embarassed to be a fan and evangelist for wikipedia. It sounds like Church propoganda.

<dd>As an evangelist for Wikipedia, you should have your own account (rather than an anonymous IP address) and know how to sign your own articles. Above all, you should know that you can make such edits yourself. This article has been edited many time by many Mormons and many who are not Mormons. Since you think such criticisms are in order, you can make such edits yourself and see how they stand up to peer review by both groups of editors of this article. If you have changed your mind about such information belonging in the introduction, then leave the article as-is. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 02:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DW: So those who have chosen not to setup an account are not qualified to be evangelists for Wikipedia? I think most here would argue with that position, and if that's the case, Wikipedia would disable such features. Of course, I know that I can make edits myself, and I did (you know there is a diff function, right?). I have not changed my mind (whatever led you to think that), and a quick scan of the article just now made me think that it is in better order and that others have helped to ensure that. Once I save this edit, maybe I'll do a diff to verify. The reason I think it ended up in the condition I first viewed it (before I and others made edits) is that more mormons were maintaining it than neutral third parties (and I'm not talking about mormon hating christians). As an editor, you should put your own unanswered questions (that you can't explain execpt by faith) about this topic up front. 64.121.2.68 08:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If someone said that they were "a fan and evangelist for" the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or any cause for that matter), but had shown by their actions that they were not a member of said organization (and never would be), what would be your first question?</dd>
<dd>Of course I know of the history; that is how I got the information to sign your comments for you. As I've told other people, editors who sign their comments and get an account (it is as anonymous as your IP address, you know) are taken more seriously than those who don't.</dd>
<dd>And IF you'd read my comments, I wrote "If you have changed your mind ...." Don't skip the short words; depending on the word and the context, the meaning of the sentence may change greatly when you leave them out. But to directly answer your question, I checked the history from when you posted the above comment (19:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)) and now, and you have not made any further edits. I also checked the introductory paragraph between my edit on the 22nd and now, and "according to the text" was added. That's it. Please evaluate for yourself my if-statement in that light.</dd>
<dd>As for the content of the introductory paragraph, I renew my admonition to you, in shorter form: Since you think such criticisms are in order in the introduction, please made the edits yourself and see if they stand up to peer review; otherwise, leave the introduction as-is. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 02:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My money says they'd never stand up to peer review, simply because in the real world they're not the relevant focus of a discussion on the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is left to stand on the merit of its content, and those who say it should only be viewed through the lens of their "Top Ten Ways to Fight Mormons" books really don't represent the statistical majority. I'm sure if one were to poll, he would see that those "concerns" aren't really the concerns of very many...

<dd>Mark Twain has no qualifications for legitimate criticism of any religion; it was not within his limited area of expertise. His writing is more appropiratly labeled Mark Twain's opinion. I think I understand why someone may have thought it appropriate to have a humor section; it is motivated by the same thought process similar to common jokes of racisim. This is a public encyclopedia and we will get all kinds of edits. It seems POV to list it and so I will delete the whole section. If someone feels differently; let's discuss it here. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:54, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What kind of qualifications does one need to legitamitely criticize religion? Maybe Mark Twain was divinely inspired in his criticism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I may not have stated it as elegantly as I could have; anyone is capable of criticizing religion or anything else. However, to have the comment noted the opinion must derive from expertise. Given thta this is an encyclopedia and not a collection of talks on the back porch, quotes should be reserved for experts. It would be like having a quote from G. W. Bush about religion; who could possibly care. He may be a Christian, but his opinion is only as good as the opinion from the Muslim down the street when it comes to quotes in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I removed the quote in question and deleted the entire section. If we are going to have an "in literature" section, we are certainly going to need more than a sarcastic critique by Mark Twain. I personally don't feel the section is necessary at all as the Book of Mormon itself is the subject of this article and few great works of literature (if any) have been influenced by it in any amount (which seems to be the purported purpose of the section, "in literature"). <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 05:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Although Mormon historians and Mormon literature sets the origin of the Book of Mormon (BoM) as having been translated from "Reformed Egyptian Symbols" found on golden plates, by the Prophet Joseph Smith using a special set of mounted seer stones on a device called the Urim and Thummim. There is a substantial body of evidence suggesting that the BoM could be the lost archives of the Jewish Khazar nomads in Russia, who left Jerusalem at 600 BC and went into the wilderness... This theory is put forth by the Dutch Historian, Nico de Jongh. His ever expanding research is found on his History webpage:</dd>

</dl>
<p>Neglecting the poor organization and grammar (first sentence starts out with "although" but doesn't have a second clause, probably supposed to join to the second part... serious run on as well). The "substantial body of evidence" they refer to is a rather embarrassing page with nothing more than original "research" (using the term loosely) consisting of seemingly random assignment of events in the Book of Mormon with elements of history (primarily russian). It ends with a request for the original documents of the Book of Mormon, which they insist Salt Lake still has, so they can have the lost/stolen record of world history. Although the page is good for a nice laugh, I seriously doubt that anything contained therein deserves our attention on this page. This article is already too long, no thanks to sections like these. <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 06:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At what point do facts enter in neutral point of view? The book of mormon is obviously false. We all understand that except for mormons. Having 2 sides of an issue argue a point isn't neutral. I'd almost prefer just stating what the mormons beileve in, instead of explaining how stupid it is, then how it's not really stupid.</p>
<p>That is a reoccuring theme. The Book of Mormon is fake, but here's why it might not be.</p>
<p>Why not just say the facts of the issue. Avoid the whole thing. Any rational human being is going to read it, and determine the issue on their own.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing like having an opinion. Have you read the NPOV policy? I am not sure what you are asking or if you are exhibiting troll behaviors.</dd>
<dd>Topics of faith are difficult; for those outside the respective faith it is at times unimaginable how anyone in their right mind could believe such outlandish claims. WIKI is not a place to judge what is "true" and what is not among any of the faith articles.</dd>
<dd>Some editors believe that balance is necessary for readers to understand an article. I personally am not an absolutist in this regard. At times in articles of faith I think we bend over backwards before the alter of Balance and doing so leads to disjointed, clumsy articles. Other times it leads to excellent articles.

<dd>"I'd almost prefer just stating what the mormons beileve in, instead of explaining how stupid it is, then how it's not really stupid." That's the spirit of NPOV, esp in encyclopediae. Balance doesn't work, ever. Because "balance" always favors the lowest common denominator--the guy with the craziest "but morally equivalent" view. Libertarianism always descends into the libertine. E.g., my mother is a member of the Interfaith Council in a county in San Francisco. Every week she tries to get the various churches to participate in some universal event, and it's not hard to find something they all believe in. But invariably there's one guy who believes something weird and in the name of "balance" believes his views should get an equal vote with catholicism, which defines 25% of the population. And the hippies give it to him. Realistically, there are 10 of these people a week, and the ensuing gridlock disallows all progress. All of us know who should have a vote in the interfaith council, and most of us believe that should be defined at the very least by number of adherents and government recognition. But "balance" stops anyone from seeing that. That's how I feel here. "Balance" is irrelevant. What we want is what the BoM is, and even some legitimate academic discussion of what it is not, but not statistically insignificant ramblings of trolls who have never read the book. --<a href="../../../m/r/c/User%7EMrcolj_d2cb.html" title="User:Mrcolj">Mrcolj</a> 19:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's much easier to discount the BoM with some crazy conspiracy theory if you haven't read it. I don't think the first poster was being a troll, though. I think his opinion was that we should just state the facts on where Mormons believe the Book of Mormon came from and what it is and let it speak for itself. He obviously believes the book is untrue but I don't think he was being trollish.Primalscreamtherapy 02:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Most non-Mormon scholars regard the book as a collection of local legends of Indian origin, fragments of autobiography, and current religious and political controversies (especially that connected with the Anti-Masonic movement), all transformed with remarkable ingenuity into a religious document." This statement is an ambiguous statement without any serious evidence to back it up (despite it's supposedly reliable source). "Most non-mormon scholars" probably don't have an opinion on the Book of Mormon and certainly (if this is true) we could point to some local indian legends that this is a "collection of." It's POV in it's placement and lack of qualification, deleting until (if necessary) we can find a better section (perhaps one regarding critics explanations for the Book of Mormon) <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 00:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an aside, there are scholars and nonscholars. Scholars can be of various religious affiliations. To differentiate between a Christian scholar and an atheist scholar is an attempt at spinning an article; it is POV. It is also POV to attempt to state that a Mormon scholar is somehow different from any a scholar of another faith, sect, denomination etc.; it is blantant spinning and POV. I reject the statement above because of its definitive attempt to spin the article. Many scholars are not religious and think that all religion is the stuff of fairy tales. There are many other scholars that are people of faith and belong to as many different religions as recognized in the world.

<p>This paragraph in the "smith as a plagiarist" section is very POV... needs some work. "However, if such plagiarism did exist, most blame would have to be placed on the shoulders of <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cowdery_98e9.html" title="Oliver Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a>." From the outset, this statement has a variety of POV insinuations that I don't think we need to go in depth on (some include Oliver Cowdery as the moving force behind the book, the word "blame" and general wording).</p>
<p>"Cowdery was educated and trained as a typesetter/printers assistant in the 1800s and worked at the <i>Poultney Gazette</i> in the summer of 1823 (the paper became known as the <i>Northern Spectator</i> in December of 1823) when Ethan Smith brought the <i>View of the Hebrews</i> manuscript to be published. Soon thereafter Cowdery left the paper and within a few months <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith</a> had reported the first divine visitation on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a>." Besides the unnerving dearth of citations in this section, this statement is POV as well because its format suggests that Oliver Cowdery had some part in Joseph Smith's "divine manifestation" (that he helped "cook up" the whole thing).</p>
<p>"This employment at the <i>Poultney Gazette</i> would not have been Cowdery's first exposure to <i>View of the Hebrews</i>; his family, including father William and stepmother Keziah, were noted as being longstanding members of Ethan Smith's congregation in Poultney when he arrived and assumed leadership in November 1821. Ethan Smith made no secret of his theories presented in <i>View of the Hebrews</i> during sermons." This statement is completely unsourced. Hopefully we can get this section cleaned up.

<p>It depends on the type of article. For "Xenu" (a Scientology topic) a discussion would be incomplete without a description of the South Park episode on the topic because it is so high-profile, but most of the pop culture sections on wiki are so obscure. . . Anyway, there are few high-profile pop culture references to the Book of Mormon so we don't need anything for now (at least in the main page).

<p>After reading the discussion of the this article, it is clear there are sincere questions about the neutrality of this article and that these concerns have been ignored. Here is just one example from the article: "Some claim Smith plagiarized material from the manuscript for an unpublished novel by Solomon Spaulding. Spaulding's romantic novel has very little in common with the Book of Mormon." While this quote acknowledges a critical point of view, it instantly disposes of it. The "Some" are not identified. Not only does Spaulding's romantic novel, readers are told, has nothing to do with the Book of Mormon, it "has very little in common," whatever that means. This construction is deliberately misleading and lacks even a weak attempt at accuracy, balance or fairness on the part of the author. If Spaulding's novel has passages that appear plagarized, let's see them and make up our minds. If you argue that the plagarism theory rubbish, let's see the point-by-point destruction of charge. The article is also riddled with sloppy, weak, dishonest and illogical thinking and expression.</p>

<p>Along these lines, I'm wondering if we can get some more substantive sources for the paragraph about "automatic writing." The paragraph names off a bunch of characteristics ("multiple authorship, use of archaic language, accounts of bygone historical figures, descriptions of times and places apparently unfamiliar to the writer, narratives with well-developed characters and plot, accounts of various ministries of Jesus Christ, poetics, occasionally impressive literary quality, doctrinal, theological, and cosmological discussions, and even discourses by deity") that "happen" to be in common with the material of the BoM, but I can't find a single reference to most of these aspects being shared with other purported automatically written works. This seems like a section taken from some anti-lit that really doesn't have a strong foundation. In looking at the wiki article on automatic writing there really aren't any similar purported works. Any ideas? I'd like to limit the section to just saying that some believe that it was written with this method (if that is indeed a belief out there.... I've never heard of it until now). Just seems like a major stretch... <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">Gentry Davies</a> 23:41, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am familiar with the concept of spirit writing, but it is not a thought supported by the academic community at large. It falls within some of the New Age movement. Dunn's hypothesis is similar to the value of an opinion; everyone has one and it is common. It is funny that he would create such a fanciful allegation at the same time he is accusing Joseph Smith of being fanciful. My grandmother's opinion was that man never walked on the moon. It is a nice opinion; but it is still false. It would be appropriate to describe Dunn's expertise in/with spirit writing and evaluating Joseph Smith's supposed use of such a thing. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally find the inclusion of such a theory degrading to "the critics point of view." It is a totally baseless theory and one that no serious critic would take seriously.

<p>Perhaps I misunderstand as to what this topic is about. If it is discussing that the book of mormon was produced by supernatural means, but not neccessarily divine, then it is supported by non-Mormon scholars including Robert Remini, University of Illinois at Chicago, Margaret Barker, biblical scholar from England and Jan Shipps, Indiana University and Purdue University at Indianapolis. In fact this was discussed during the recent Library of congress symposium on the topic of Smith. It has long been the response of those who think that smith himself was led astray. Naturalistic scholars don't subscribe to the theory, but naturalistic scholars are declining - many of the new movements in history say that perhaps things happened the way the historical sources thought they did - they don't try to explain it by science, but by evidences - regardless of what they point to.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a bizarre discussion, but one that interests me. It's hard to be objective when some issues are so polarizing. Should insane nutty crackpot theories be included on Wikipedia? Probably, if many people have them, making them encyclopediac. The Spalding book would be a good example. It's a plainly baseless accusation (the mere fact that the book was written with a couple parallel plot points but almost nothing in common makes conspiracy theorists get excited), but it must be included because it's a common baseless accusation. Even on the main Mormon page it includes the "Are Mormons Christian" debate even though it's a lame debate, because it's a common debate. Where do we draw the line between encyclopediac and non-encyclopedic?Primalscreamtherapy 02:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand the purpose of the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. As can be seen on the <a href="http://www.irr.org/mit/BOM/1830bom-p1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.irr.org/mit/BOM/1830bom-p1.html" rel="nofollow">title page</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon">first edition of the Book of Mormon</a> the book claims to be "written by the hand of Mormon" and that Joseph Smith himself claimed to be the "author and proprietor". In 1830, the only way to secure a copyright for a work, even if it was translated, was to file the application as the "author and proprietor". Thus, Joseph Smith's assertion that he translated the Book of Mormon is consistent with the law of the time and the wording on the title page of the first edition of the book.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems to be a polemic entry to defeat the claim that because Joseph Smith claims to be the author then he created it. I don't think it belongs; it is a weak accusation from critics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>2. In addition to the possibility of a quotation by Nephi, members also say that Joseph could have referred to the KJV version during the translation, and, as such, the errors in the KJV could have been transferred to the <i>Book of Mormon</i>. The Book of Mormon Institute Manual notes that all prophets, ancient and modern, quote existing scripture as it is known to the people of their time, rather than forming their own translations of the text. It cites the authors of the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) in quoting scripture to the Greeks as it was known to them, rather than retranslating the originals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again this sounds polemic. The section should just be presenting the different views on the genesis of the Book of Mormon wihtout all the pros andcons.</p>
<dl>
<dd>3. This position tends to be the most commonly-held among Smith's critics (including <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_Mormons_d5c4.html" title="New Order Mormons">New Order Mormons</a> and non-Mormons in general). Some <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter-day_Saint_0bda.html" title="Latter-day Saint">Latter-day Saint</a> apologists, such as <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Nibley_f37e.html" title="Hugh Nibley">Hugh Nibley</a>, reject this viewpoint, claiming that it is nearly impossible to write such a book within such a period of time, particularly given that Smith was an unlearned man with little or no knowledge of Hebrew peoples. Forensic evidence is equally debated and remains inconclusive. However, some believe there is evidence to indicate that Joseph Smith had both the capability and resources to accomplish this task (Vogel 2004).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Based upon the legitimate NPOV concerns I have begun to edit the article. The above paragraphs I felt were more polemic than necessary. I still do not think the outline works well. There should be one section that addresses the official version of the genesis of the Book of Mormon; it now bleeds over several areas and is redundant. Further, the sections on alternative views of its genesis needs to be clearly defined without rebuttal. I do think with the discovery of the actual Spaulding manuscript that this theory should be presented as a debunked theory. All writers previous to their discovery were relying on hearsay and quoting earlier sources that also did not have the manuscript for reference. However, the balance of the theories are appropriate.</p>
<p>I think this is only a beginning and others should begin to "scrub" the article. If someone feels like some of the above information needs to be reinserted to the article, pelase feel free; but please do not use them in their current form or in their previous places. Cheers. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:31, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>4. A significant segment of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, namely 2 Nephi chapters 7, 8, and 12-24, matches nearly word-for-word the chapters 50, 51-52:1-2, and 2-14 (respectively) of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Translation</a> (1611) of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a>. Whilst this is a point of argument for those who do not accept the divine origin of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, Latter-day Saints accept these passages as quotations from Isaiah by Nephi. The footnotes and chapter headings acknowledge this and encourage comparisons between Isaiah and 2 Nephi. There are differences in more than half of the 433 verses of Isaiah that are quoted in the <i>Book of Mormon</i>; some minor, some significant.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Critics note, however, that there are many word-for-word quotations purportedly taken from the KJV that are no longer accepted in current English translations of the Bible. They are considered as later additions placed by a scribe or monk. The most well-known example is Mark 16:15-18 which is quoted nearly word-for-word in Mormon 9:22-24, the passage concerning believers holding snakes and drinking poison. This passage does not appear in many early manuscripts and is widely believed to be composed in the 2nd century.(See <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_16.html" title="Mark 16">Mark 16</a>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that as well as apparently direct quotations, the book overall reflects the 1611 KJV literary and linguistic style. Given the absence of the RSV at the time, this is unsurprising since the KJV was the most commonly used translation of the Bible when the Book of Mormon was produced.</p>
<p>This should probably be added by in under the critics section, but I am focused on other areas of the article and did not want to lose this data. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Storm Rider, you asked me for some comments. I am unfortunately rather busy at the moment, so I can't say too much, but I noticed that you put the title of the subsection you removed, "Passages...", under the Historicity section. The subsection would not fit well with Historicity as it discusses issues outside the text of the book (archaeology, DNA, etc.). The subsection originally came from the Origins section which discusses issues of the origins of the text and it is best to remain there. Perhaps the title of the section could be renamed as "Critics' explanations"?

<p>Under this section of the article, the following paragraph seems improperly quoted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ferguson wrote a 20 February 1976 letter to Mr &amp; Mrs H.W. Lawrence in which he stated: "...The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere — because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology. I should say — what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book."[5]</dd>
</dl>
<p>The implication of the presentation in this article seems to be that Ferguson was assessing the picture for the Book of Mormon as bleak.

<p>In the Critic's View section, it stated that Olive Cowdery never retracted his witness that he saw the plates in vision. I changed this to leave out the "in vision" to eliminate confusion. The testimony says that God came and showed them to him... In contrast, the testimony of the eight witnesses makes it fairly obvious that they saw and "hefted" the plates. I don't think that we can really say whether God came and showed them the plates physically or in a vision... for that reason I took out the reference... any ideas?<a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">Gentry Davies</a> 23:54, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery never "hefted" the plates, as he was part of the "The Three Witnesses" who were (as the declaration says) shown the plates by an angel who came down from heaven. You are thinking of "The Eight Witnesses" who claim to have had the otherwise exclusive privilege of actually touching them. That being said, Cowdery's own words should be used whenever possible. If he ever stated that it was a "vision" it should be written as such. If not, it should be left out. Either way, I'd like to see citations.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, a few passages in the "Smith as plagiarist" section concern me. While it is admitted that David Persuitte's book (which I have not read) shows parallels between <i>View of the Hebrews</i> and <i>The Book of Mormon</i> it quickly points out <i>but notes no instances of direct copying, nor does he demonstrate that Smith ever read or even encountered the book.</i> B.H. Roberts book <i>Studies of the Book of Mormon</i> not only marks parallel passages, but points out that <i>View of the Hebrews</i> and other similar works were repeatedly checked out at the library 5 miles from Smith's home, making it quite likely that he was, at the very least, familiar with the books. None of this is mentioned however. Perhaps it would make the article too long, but if that is the case, the plagiarist section may just be in need of a rewrite. Thoughts anyone? <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapache_b7f7.html" title="User:Mapache">Mapache</a> 22:27, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Last complaint for today I promise&#160;;). The archaeology section mentions elephants as one of the "evidence once thought lacking." While elephants did (along with horses) live in the americas in the pleistocene period, the citation links to what seems to be a personal website, which also fails to link to the American Aniquarian Society's actual article. The context of the passage in the encyclopedia entry implies that the bones of the elephants dated to Book of Mormon times. Is there a credible citation for this claim? <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapache_b7f7.html" title="User:Mapache">Mapache</a> 22:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just reading the article, and thinking the same thing. This article should be about the book and it's contents. Some history should be presented as to it's origins through Joseph Smith, but I think the sections on criticisms and alternate theories should be made into separate articles. Don't think I am trying to make it a POV article, but the article should be about the book and it's contents. I would rather see sections on each individual book than about criticisms and rebuttels. 68.4.225.187 03:35, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What an interesting, but unfortunately, completely incorrect statement about LDS or Mormon beliefs; wholly lacking in truth. I think you might now put that axe down and begin to edit from a neutral position and seek to gain a deeper understanding of LDS doctrine and thought.</dd>
<dd>Studge, you also made a similar, but more complete, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mormonism&amp;diff=96357052&amp;oldid=96241569" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mormonism&amp;diff=96357052&amp;oldid=96241569" rel="nofollow">statement</a> on the Mormonism talk page. The Bibles we use today are translations of a muliple translations. LDS believe that the Bible contains mistranslations. Bart D. Ehrman, chair of the Department of Religious Studies at UNC at Chapel Hill, has written an excellent book regarding this very subject entitled, <i>Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why</i>. Suffice it today that there are a multitude of reasons to understand that there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060738170" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060738170" rel="nofollow">errors in the text</a> we recognize as the Bible today. It should be noted that Ehrman has nothing to do with the LDS church and is not a member. To see some differences in the text from an LDS perspective please see the Joseph Smith <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jst/contents" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jst/contents" rel="nofollow">translation</a> of the Bible. The link just provided gives some examples of differences from an LDS perspective; however, I would recommend reading Ehrman's book. It is completely neutral; he is not writing from a specific church's viewpoint. It is an accomplished, highly regarded scholar's results from his personal research as well as the research of a number of scholars for the last few hundred years.

<p>I don't know which Bibles you use today. Actually most of them are not translations of multiple translations, but translations of base texts which are not themselves translations. There are indeed many known mistranslations in the King James Bible, the Bible which the Book of Mormon is identical to in many cases. I read the LDS notes on Joseph Smith's "translation" and according to this it is not a true translation but adds items to the Bible. It seems to me that Joseph Smith claimed to translate the Book of Mormon from some trablets. Over the years the text of the Book of Mormon itself has changed, seemingly admitting that it also has translation errors, so it seems to me that if you say you accept the Bible "as far as it is translated correctly" you must also say the same about the Book of Mormon, as the LDS changes to the Book of Mormon imply to me that it was not translated correctly. This would be fairer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Studge (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStudge_6404.html" title="User talk:Studge">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Studge_d020.html" title="Special:Contributions/Studge">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Even the NIV, which is considered the most accurate English translation, is not from the original or even the oldest manuscripts. ALL english translations that I'm aware of do not from the oldest specimin of manuscripts (dated to the 3rd and fourth century) - which don't read the same as each other as it is (see for example <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html#Losses_and_early_editing" title="Gospel of Mark">Gospel_of_Mark#Losses_and_early_editing</a>). Each English translation comes from greek, hebrew and the vulgate translations. See the translators intro to the NIV. I personally use an eight translation bible when studying the bible - as the multiple translations help me to understand difficult passages much better - i was suprised at how different each one is. The LDS church uses the KJV officially, but Smith was partial to the German bible. Second, a copy of an origininal is considered a translation - as it is a second "rendering" of the original. So unless you have the original documents that Moses down to John the Revelator wrote on, you are likely dealing with imperfect documents. Monks or whomever meticuouly copied by hand the entire manuscripts weren't perfect, and it is fun to go back and read soem of their mistakes - especially when they caught them themselves. I thank God for thier efforts to preserve such a sacred text and the account of Jesus, but realize mistakes creep in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible indeed added things to the text. Some of which has been corraberated by other sources, interstingly enough - such as the vision of enoch, which is strikingly similar to a work attribted to enoch that was found in the dead sea scrolls, including the introduction by smith of a man named "Mahijah" who was named in connection with enoch in the dead sea scrolls text. Also, Smith's own prophecy of a prophet by the name of joseph, a descendant of Ephriam, (which he is often criticised as adding a prophescy about himself) follows jewish talmudic legend about Messiah ben Joseph - see Encyclopedia Judaica 11:1411 which states: "A secondary messianic figure is the Messiah son of [of the tribe of] Joseph (or Ephraim), whose coming precedes that of the Messiah, son of David, and who will die in combat with the enemies of God and Israel." This figure is supposed to restore israel's temple worship. - a striking similarity to Smith's own JST addition. That said, some of his translation "corrections" are more study-related notes, and have little to do with the original texts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the Book of Mormon, the introduction (I see a common thread of reading introductions here, don't you?) of it in the current edition states that some errors have been perpetuated in past editions. The current edition is compared to the original (we have those) documents and printers manuscript (we have that too) and post publication corrections by Smith himself to bring it in line with the highest standards possible. There have been 3900 changes if you compare the first edition book of mormon with the current edition. However, 98 percent of them are punctuation only. one percent is textual errors from the printing of the manuscript, which has plenty of spelling and misplaced words, missing phrases, etc. And one percent is changing words into modern vernacular (just as the KJV and other bibles have been, not uncommon) - ie word usage including "were"'s instead of "was"'s and "exceeding" to "exceedingly" - which was proper writing in 1830, but not now. Interestingly that of the 433 verses that quote pre-lehite biblical scripture, 280 of them don't match the KJV, but match the septagint, or are a combination of both.</dd>

<dd>As far as your "fairer" statement, the comment that Mormons want to use teh bible "as far as it is translated correctly" is not an unfair statemnt. I know plenty of Mormon scholars who would add the same appendage to the use of the book of Mormon (ie the interpretation of it). We are not claiming that the Book of Mormon is perfect and that the bible is not. Both acknowledge their own faults - they were both written by multiple prophets who were men, and as such have errors.</dd>

<p>Okay assuming that what you write is generally accepted I propose applying the phrase "as far as it is translated correctly" to both the Bible and the BofM, if as you say Mormon views on both books is the same. I don't want an argument just fairness. It seemd to be to be a bit unfair to put a "rider" on the Bible but not on the BofM when Mormons claim both are translations. Just seemed unfair to me. If it is not unfair then we canapply to rider to both, so I have littly edited that way.</p>

<dd>Joseph Smith said: “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.” (History of the Church, 4:461.) Joseph Smith also said "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly, we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." (8th Article of Faith).</dd>

<dd>LDS belief is that the writings that make up the Bible were originally written by prophets called by God, but then copied and recopied by those without priesthood authority, and ultimately translated by the knowledge of men. On the other hand, the writtings that make up the Book of Mormon were written by prophets called by God, abridged (and translated in the case of the Book of Ether) by prophets called by God, with the resulting work translated to English by a prophet called by God. Therefore, although LDS don't consider the Book of Mormon to be 'perfect', the qualification "as far as it is translated correctly" doesn't apply to the Book of Mormon in the same way it does to the Bible. <a href="../../../7/4/s/User%7E74s181.html" title="User:74s181">74s181</a> 18:27, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As proof that Cumorah is the same as Cumorah New York, <a href="../../../g/l/y/User%7EGlyns_7b89.html" title="User:Glyns">User:Glyns</a> added a reference to the D&amp;C, which states, "And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets—the book to be revealed."</p>
<p>This hardly says Cumorah New York is the same Hill where the Nephite/Jaredite last battles took place.</p>
<p>Most current LDS Scholars associate the New York Cumorah differently from the Last Battle Cumorah - you may want to read <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_Cumorah_d691.html" title="Hill Cumorah">Hill Cumorah</a> and its associated references. From your edits, I'm guessing that you are not very familiar with the current state of Mormonism academia, and are using much older writings if you associate this together.</p>
<p>Sanders' hill, Mormon Hill, which is now known as "Hill Cumorah, New York" was named by Cowdery in the Messenger and Advocate (published between 1834-5) for it holding the plates until Smith's finding them. That is the first reference we have of it being called it. However, Manti, Utah and the Book of Mormon "Manti" are two seperate locations. And Zarahemla Iowa (also referenced in the D&amp;C) is different than Zarahemla where the Nephites were, and Bountiful, Utah Temple, is different than the temple in Bountiful where the Book of Mormon says Jesus visited the Lehites.</p>
<p>As evidence that the Hill Cumorah and Hill Cumorah, New York are different places, one need only to look at the stated vision of Cowdery and Smith - in vision they went to a Hill Cumorah, which had caves. In the caves there was a room full of plates, and Nephite artifacts. Such a cave never existed, nor could have existed in the New York location.</p>
<p>However, aside from common sense, here are references:</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia of Mormonism states: "Cumorah had also been the site of the destruction of the Jaredites roughly 900 years earlier. Moroni states in the book of Ether that the Jaredites gathered for battle near the hill Ramah, the same hill where his father Mormon hid up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred. It was near the first landing site of the people of Mulek, just north of the land Bountiful and a narrow neck of land... The more common reference to Cumorah among Latter-day Saints is to the hill near present-day Palmyra and Manchester New York, where the plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon were found.....In 1928, the church purchased the Western New York hill...." (punctuation errors are mine).</p>
<p>In the Glossary of the same work it defines Cumorah" as "(1) A hill in which the Book of Mormon prophet Mormon concealed sacred records before the annihilation of his people; (2) the hill in New York State, near the town of Palmyra, where Joseph Smith unearthed the gold plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>In the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies: Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon P172, states: Wilson attempts to make Joseph Smith responsible for the Hemispheric Geography Model by claiming that he "located the Hill Cumorah...in Palmyra, New York" an assertion for which Wilson, once again provides no evidence. In fact the Earliest explicit correlation of the hill in New York where Joseph Smith found the golden plates and the Hill Cumorah mentioned in the Book of Mormon comes not from Joseph Smith, but from Oliver Cowdery. Joseph Smith simply describes a hill of considerable size - no name is given....Joseph also supported a version of the Limited Geography Model...1841 John Lloyd Stephens published volume one of his Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan, the first accessible English-language account of the Maya ruins.52 It was enthusiastically received by the early Mormons, who saw it both as a validation of the Book of Mormon and as a source to help understand Book of Mormon geography. An editorial reviewing this book in the Times and Seasons was written either by Joseph Smith or John Taylor.53 The editorial speculated that the city of Zarahemla was to be found in modern Guatemala north of the Isthmus of Panama (called Darien in the early nineteenth century).54 Since the internal geography of the Book of Mormon places Zarahemla south of the narrow neck of land,55 the editorial implies that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rather than Panama, was the Book of Mormon narrow neck of land. Thus Joseph Smith, rather than insisting only on the validity of the Hemispheric Geography Model, both advocated an early form of the Limited Geography Model and encouraged the modification of geographical interpretations of the Book of Mormon based on the discovery of new evidence.56 The important thing to note is that the core concept of the Limited Geography Model was in existence in 1842, with the approval and possible authorship of Joseph Smith…This issue has been dealt with by Latter-day Saint writers; it is unfortunate that Wilson is unwilling or unable to come to grips with the reality of current Latter-day Saint thought on the subject, relying instead on old discredited anti-Mormon arguments. Actually, the Limited Geography Model does not insist that there were two Cumorahs. Rather, there was one Cumorah in Mesoamerica, which is always the hill referred to in the Book of Mormon. Thereafter, beginning with Oliver Cowdery (possibly based on a misreading of Mormon 6:6), early Mormons began to associate the Book of Mormon Cumorah with the hill in New York where Joseph Smith found the plates. The Book of Mormon itself is internally consistent on the issue. It seems to have been early nineteenth-century Latter-day Saint interpretation of the text of the Book of Mormon which has caused the confusion on this point. Thus, advocates of the Limited Geography Model are required only to show that their interpretations are consistent with the text of the Book of Mormon itself, not with any nineteenth-century interpretation of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>The question of how the golden plates could have been carried from Mesoamerica to New York has also been answered by Sorenson. Once again Wilson has misread the Book of Mormon, claiming that the Limited Geography Model forces Moroni to transport "the entire Nephite library over two thousand miles to the New York Cumorah" (3b). In fact, Mormon 6:6 specifically states that all the Nephite records, ‘’except’’ the Book of Mormon plates, were buried in the hill Cumorah near the narrow neck of land by Mormon, not Moroni. Nowhere in the Book of Mormon does it state where the Book of Mormon plates were finally buried.</p>
<p>Next: David A. Palmer, Review of Books on the Book of Mormon, p.72 states: This summary of the archaeology of western New York, developed by a prominent archaeologist, shows that the region of western New York could not have been the scene of the culture described in considerable detail by Mormon. Where are the ruins? Where are all the other cultural facets demanded by his text? They simply are not there. This author fails to show that the Nephites ever lived in that area. By contrast, there is substantial evidence for a Mesoamerican location for those cultures. In fact, there is agreement on a number of site locations being specific Book of Mormon cities. There is also general agreement that the probable site of the Hill Ramah/Cumorah was at the hill called Vigía, in Veracruz, Mexico.</p>
<p>Next, John A. Tvedtnes, Review of Books on the Book of Mormon, p.261 states: The story of the cave full of plates inside the Hill Cumorah in New York is often given as evidence that it is, indeed, the hill where Mormon hid the plates. Yorgason quotes one version of the story from Brigham Young and alludes to six others collected by Paul T. Smith. Unfortunately, none of the accounts is firsthand. The New York Hill Cumorah is a moraine laid down anciently by a glacier in motion. It is comprised of gravel and earth. Geologically, it is impossible for the hill to have a cave, and all those who have gone in search of the cave have come back empty-handed. If, therefore, the story attributed to Oliver Cowdery (by others) is true, then the visits to the cave perhaps represent visions, perhaps of some far distant hill, not physical events.</p>
<p>And, William J. Hamblin, Review of Books on the Book of Mormon, p.478-9 states, 1. The Book of Mormon itself specifically states that the golden plates of the Book of Mormon were not buried in Cumorah (Mormon 6:6). If Joseph is the author of the Book of Mormon, and wished to make this identification, why did he state the opposite in his text? Assuming Joseph was the author of the Book of Mormon, this would indicate, at the very least, that he had not made the correlation in his own mind by the summer of 1829. What caused Joseph later to decide to make this correlation? 2. The Book of Mormon strongly implies that the Hill Cumorah is near the narrow neck of land (Mormon 4–6, Ether 14).89(1) If Joseph were inventing the text, and already had in mind a hemispheric geography and an identification of the hill in New York with the ancient Cumorah as Metcalfe maintains, why did he place the hill Cumorah near the isthmus of Panama—the narrow neck of the hemispheric model? 3. Joseph never identifies the hill in which he found the plates as the hill Cumorah. Indeed, even after that identification became commonplace, Joseph simply calls it “a hill of considerable size,” which was “convenient to the village of Manchester” (Joseph Smith–History 1:51). If I were convinced that the evidence supported Joseph as the author of the identification of the New York hill with the Book of Mormon Cumorah I would not hesitate to accept it. It ultimately makes no difference to the limited geography model, because it would not change the possibility that the identification was Joseph’s personal interpretation. But whether one believes that Joseph translated an ancient book or fabricated a fantasy tale, the evidence seems to indicate that Joseph did not originally have the identification of the ancient Nephite Cumorah with the hill in New York in mind. This seems to come as an afterthought, deriving either from Joseph himself in personal conversation (as Metcalfe maintains), from W. W. Phelps, or from some other unidentified source.</p>
<p>See Also, David A. Palmer: In Search of Cumorah p 25-27, Sorensen: An Ancient American Setting 44-45. And I’ve only hit a few of the sources on the matter.</p>
<p>I gladly acknowledge that some Mormons have associated the two – and they are those who followed the school of thought of Joseph Fielding Smith (which include McConkie), but even he was inconclusive: in <i>Doctrines of Salvation</i> Vol. 3, JFSmith states after quoting D&amp;C 128 "While this statement is not positively declared that the Hill Cumorah is the place where the plates were obtained..." BH Roberts was much less certain the locations were the same, and stated he highly doubted the two were linked, aside from being the place where Moroni placed this small set of plates for Smith to find (see BH Roberts <i>Defense of the Faith and the Saints</i>, vol 1, and <i>New Witnesses for God</i> vol 2 - where he discusses both sides of the argument). However, this association is not founded on anything more than Cowdery’s, Phelps, and others words, not the Book of Mormon or Smith himself. A case of folklore, and repeated poor scholarship by Wilson.</p>

<dd>Umm, your last edit about how the plates got to New York, is...well not sure how to categorize. Moroni was alive for 21 years after the last battle. He could have gone around the world dozens of times, let alone from Mesoamerica to New York. Mormon folklore places Moroni as dedicating some temple sites including Logan and Manti. 21 years and the help of God does "address the problem of how the Golden Plates, stone box, and numerous other artefacts Joseph Smith said he found came to be near <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmyra_%28town%29%2C_New_York_f285.html" title="Palmyra (town), New York">Palmyra, New York</a>" quite adequately. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 17:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The book of Moroni makes no reference to moving the plates, etc., nor to any motivation for doing so - strange it wouldn't mention it, as Mormon, Moroni's father, is recorded as having carefully chosen the hiding place in the hill Cumorah...</dd>
<dd>"Mormon folklore" can hardly be considered an authority in any way, as no link has ever been established between Mormon belief and geographical reality.</dd>
<dd>If by "the help of God" you mean a supernatural teleportation, this absolutely does not address the problem, as no such event has ever been verified (and the book of Moroni would doubtless have mentioned it). So the problem i outlined remains. <a href="../../../g/l/y/User%7EGlyns_7b89.html" title="User:Glyns">Glyns</a> 19:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Moroni both refer to the plates being moved - to protect them and to prepare them for being hidden. For example, Mormon 6:6 states that all of the plates, but the ones Moroni worked on were hidden in the Hill Cumorah <i>by Mormon</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and '<i>having been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were sacred, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this record out of the plates of Nephi, and <b>hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.</b></i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>"In other words, the Book of Mormon explicitly states that the records hidden in the Mesoamerican Cumorah were not the plates of the Book of Mormon, but were the other records of the Nephites. The Book of Mormon itself provides no name for the hill in which the golden plates found by Joseph Smith were buried." see journal of book of mormon studies referenced above p.173, and Mormon 8:4, 14-22; Moroni chapters 1 and 10; and Ether 15:11.</p>
<p>Also see, as referenced above, Sorenson's "An Ancient American Setting," p44-45. In this, he discusses how and why Moroni would have carried the plates to New York to make them readily available to Smith in it's stone time capsule.</p>
<p>An examination of a map of North America shows that it is possible to sail along the coast of Mexico, up the Mississippi River, and then up the Ohio River to within less than one hundred miles of the New York hill where the plates were buried. Trails and waterways along these major rivers have existed for several thousand years. Sorenson provides a sixteenth-century example of someone walking a similar route in less than a year;59(1) Moroni had thirty-five years between the final battles of the Nephites and when he buried the plates.60(2) Thus, the plates could have been transported by canoe to New York, along well-used waterways of the Hopewell Indians (who flourished c. 200 B.C. to A.D. 400) (IBID 173)</p>
<p>For a map of American Indian civilizations in the Mississippi River valley at the time of Moroni, see Michael Coe, Dean Snow, and Elizabeth Benson, Atlas of Ancient America (New York: Facts on File, 1986), 51, where it shows that the Hopewell archaeological complex extended from Louisiana to New York along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Analysis of various artifacts has demonstrated that there was extensive trade along these river systems in the fifth century a.d.; Brian M. Fagan, Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1991), 366-67, 370-76, 392-4 (IBID 173)</p>
<p>As far as your "Mormon Folklore" statement, my reference is a vision given to Brigham Young at the Manti Temple - I refer to it as Mormon Folklore as it wasn't recorded by Young himself, but by others, and it has taken a life of its own. Folklore isn't always wrong - it usually has some sort of truth in it - even if twisted beyond recognition. Look at your reliance on someone quoting Wilson's research about Cumorah. He states that the Hill cumorah in new york couldn't be the same one. Well he's probably right-that's the truth of the folklore, however, the ignoring of research and Smith's own statements and it taking a life of its own creates the folklore you are referencing. And as far as "the help of God" I do not mean teleportation, but Moroni was divinely led as to where to bury the plates. Not that hard to do in 21-37 years (The final battles were 384 years after the birth of Christ (Mormon 6:4), while Moroni buried the plates 420 years after the birth of Christ (Moroni 10:1).).</p>
<p>We have record of Whitmer and Smith meeting Moroni physically carrying the plates instead of smith on one occasion when Smith needed to transport the plates from one location to another. Moroni had adequate time to carry them from one part of the americas to the other. I'm suprised you didn't bring up how Moroni supposedly died. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 20:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>No version of the Book of Mormon into modern English has been produced, even though LDS are happy to amend and translate the book.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't want to address the POV part of this, but want to state that a modern english translation has been produced at least three times. One by the RLDS, one at BYU and one by the translation department - and the latter of which is used in the translation process into various languages. It is easier for the translators into languages such as tagolog, etc. to refer to modern usage than to try to address the multi-interpreation nuances of the older KJV English. Anyway, just wanted to address, as the way it was written on the first legal-sized paper is still valid, although portions of newer editions have been modified or corrected back to this pre-publication manuscript, the way SMith, cowdery and others wrote from Smith's mouth, it stands. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 15:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unsigned ANON editor, Wikipedia is not an arbitrator of what is true, but rather it reports facts, i.e. what happened, when, who said it, etc. Because a book says something, or a reputable expert states something, is not POV. Quoting them is not POV; it is quoting them. It is neutral and meets <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy to say that "Moroni 10:3-5 states ..." Conversely, POV is saying, "The Book of Mormon is true" without attributing it to a source. In doing so, wikipedia is being presented as saying something is true, which is not acceptable.</p>
<p>I think the confusion you are having results from your POV. I assume you disagree with the statement in the Book of Mormon, the Book of Mormon itself, and Mormonism in general; that is your perogative. It is not your perogative to ensure that wikipedia matches your POV. Does this help or make sense?

<p>The sentence is POV, probably doesn't belong and includes a weasel phrase (some claim).

If it's poor scholarship, it shouldn't be included (not just given a weasel word intro). While I haven't been able to get a hold of the source personally, everything looks in order, and this would definitely be substantial evidence supporting Book of Mormon claims. This, in addition to Stela 5 (and translations of its glyphs), the cultural weights and measures used in Guatemala corresponding to the Book of Mormon record, and a variety of other evidence seems to be contrary to the gist of this sentence. <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 23:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not exactly sure issue you're addressing, but maybe this will help... The Bible is subdivided into separate "books" which are generally authored by separate individuals (i.e. the book of Matthew the book of Mark, etc.). The Book of Mormon is arranged in a similar fashion with each book being written by a principal author (usually a prophet). You of course understand this, but the point that this statement might be attempting to make is muddled with some strange wording ("self-claimed to have been written by different authors"). What they're saying is true, but either needs to be reworded or elaborated on to not induce the false impression that the book as a whole is "self-claimed to have been written by different authors" conspiring together, or something of that nature. I'd rather have something along the lines of "The Book of Mormon is divided into separate books in a format similar to the Bible." Something that simple would suffice (the term "separate authors" isn't strictly true, 1 nephi and 2 nephi, the book of Omni with several authors, etc.) thoughts? <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 09:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is anyone going to mention the racism in that "white and delightsome" passgage, or the way that the church edited it to "fair and delightsom" even though Joseph Smith supposedly translated it under the inspiration of God?</p>
<p>The passage in question specifically teaches that negroes are dark-skinned as a punishment, and repaets the usual slaveowner's compliant about them being sly and lazy. I think it's 2 Nephi 5:11 or thereabouts.</p>

<dd>For a quick explanation see <a href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/faq.php?id=15&amp;table=questions" class="external text" title="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/faq.php?id=15&amp;table=questions" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. Although the meaning of "white" and "pure" in this context is the same, Joseph corrected this error in the 1840 edition to avoid confusion (or imply racism). However, future editions missed the correction until the 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon. The church placed a note about this in the 1981 edition, it reads:
<dl>
<dd><i>About this edition</i>: Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of the Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate to bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and early editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The passage in question (2 Nephi 5:21-24) is referencing the Lamanites (not negroes), and, contrary to popular belief, does not refer to the "skin of blackness" as a cursing. Instead, the curse is that "they are cut off from the presence of God (2 Nephi 5:20). Because of the wickedness of the Lamanites, they were separated from the Nephites and from the presence of God. So that the Nephites could know who were parts of this group (who were cut off from the presence of God) they had a <i>mark</i> set upon them, a "skin of blackness." Alma 3:14 helps clarify:
<dl>
<dd>"Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Although the Book of Mormon does not elaborate on how the Lamanites acquired this "skin of blackness," it's possible that this was a result of marrying "outside the covenant" with other Native people not part of Lehi's clan.

I have heard that excellent Evangelical preachers state on numerous occaisions the same thing you are repeating, but not one of them, as in zero, has ever been able to provide information on the societies and cultures of the Americas. Where did they come from? Where did they go? How did some of them just dissappear?</dd>
<dd>More to the point, the Book of Mormon is not a history book, but rather a book of history <b>based upon the spiritual dealings</b> of God of the ancient Americas. You can not equivically state it is false; that is called POV and you are welcome to it. What you are not welcome to is to enforce it on the public at large. As I have said before, keep it for your blog. I am reverting again for violation of NPOV. Do not change unless you can explain why it is in keeping with this bedrock principle of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:41, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I was saying is: there are religions like the nation of Islam which claim history that is completely unsubstiated, and on this encyclopedia is labeled as pseudohistory. Why does Mormon pseudohistory get expemted from it? And I can provide information on the societies of ancient America, try me, though I am not proffesional, this is my faviorte thing in history to study. Even if it is pseudohistory, that shouldn't change your belifs, you have that "burning in your bossum" and your "testimoney" that is more then adequetly making the book of Mormon true for you. This does not make it true in reality by any stretch of the imagination, but you can belive whatever you want. There are wackos that belive that the white race was created by a man named "Yakub" though they don't respect me, I respect them (though I am glad that they are not present here in SLovakia). My point is, you can belive this, but it has no historical value. This is not a POV, it is a fact that stands the historical value of the book of Mormon from a purely historical value is zero, none what so ever. That is why it should be tagged as such, or if we are going to get into this objective truth nonsense the category of pseudohistory should be done away with. Why shoudl we stop at allowing this to be passed off as history? --<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorbian_d8a7.html" title="User:Jorbian">Jorbian</a> 19:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would never claim to be an expert on Mesoamerican history, and I would also never imply that I have an amazingly complete omniscience in all things related to Central America (as you have). It's embarrassing (though slightly humorous) to see people frantically and bullishly supporting their trolling their POV through Wikipedia, but there comes a point when it's not cute anymore. I defy you to disprove the Book of Mormon. Find a source with undeniable evidence that nothing in the Book of Mormon could have happened and then stick it in the article. That's what we do in Wikipedia. In the meantime (while you aren't finding this evidence) you can answer for the evidence stacked up in favor of the Book of Mormon's historicity. Some of these evidences (there's no reason to go into overkill here, but this might get you started) might be the present use of Guatemalan weights and measures (of ancient origin, by the way) that directly mirror those described in Alma 11, the plausible location of Nahom in Arabia (which has been demonstrated impossible for Joseph Smith to have known), the presence of a continually running stream on the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba (extremely extremely rare in Arabia) as described in 2 Nephi 2, the precolumbian city of "Lamanai", the destruction of the Olmecs at the same time described by the Book of Mormon (unknown in Joseph Smith's time). If you want more, we can do this, but it's completely irrelevant. We want Facts (how things are or what people did/said). Unless you can unequivocally prove that everything in the Book of Mormon is historically incorrect (Just about every biblical scholar will agree that God's conversation with Satan isn't "historically accurate," though there are numerous historical facts throughout the Bible) you absolutely cannot justify adding this POV category. Please don't continue to add this, it's vandalism at worst and POV trolling at best. <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 01:51, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My point is that there is a double standard! The Nation of Islam's fake history gets pseudohistory, but the LDS's does not. I want to know why that is justified. And if I was claiming omnisense, it was not intended, but I am very, very, very, very confident in the fact that the Nephites never existed. I would belive that Yakub created the whtie race before I could belive that. USing your same arguments, we could say: how do we know that Yakub didnt create the white race. My point is there is a double standard for hte LDS only because they actually have people on here and that's the only reason why. --<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorbian_d8a7.html" title="User:Jorbian">Jorbian</a> 15:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorbian_d8a7.html" title="User:Jorbian">Jorbian</a> 15:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the talk page for <b>Book of Mormon</b> and that is the subject of this article. Another article's (alleged or real) failings should have absolutely no effect on the content of this article. If you have a bone to pick with them, go for it. In the meantime, we're not going to follow your "gut" that Nephites never existed (gut speculation with absolutely zero archaeological support) over various and extensive evidence to the contrary. The fact that you see absolutely no merit in the theory that the ancient Mayan civilization is that of the Nephites as described in the Book of Mormon (and the Olmecs, the Jaredites) is illustrative of your personal bias and set worldview rather than an honest interpretation of the archaeological evidence at hand. Please feel free to make useful contributions to this article (properly sourced), but please refrain from forcing your POV on everyone else and displaying it as fact. <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 18:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Wow.</b> There are a whole lot of exclamation marks being thrown around here, so I hesitate to enter. But, I think I have something worth offering. Religious Studies hold that sacred books are neither history or pseudohistory.</p>
<p>For example, if we look at the Bible, we find several disputed areas where there is no historical evidence to back up its time line or facts, especially within the first 12 chapters of Genesis--but even the Exodus is troublesome in terms of history. Yet it is still contextually meaningful regardless of what can or can't be dug up to verify the event. These types of books are written with less emphasis on historical fact, and more upon instilling faith and showing God's hand at work among his people. In Religious Studies, this is called a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_history.html" title="Sacred history">Sacred history</a>. The Bible, Book of Mormon, and the story of <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakub.html" title="Yakub">Yakub</a> would all fall under this category.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_history.html" title="Sacred history">Sacred history</a> article on Wikipedia has not yet been written. I am happy to contribute to it, and welcome participation. What are your thoughts? Is a Sacred history tag for this article and others (versus either a history or pseudohistory tag) an acceptable move? Regards,--<a href="../../../r/o/j/User%7ERojerts_4901.html" title="User:Rojerts">Rojerts</a> 16:11, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would love to collaberate on that as well, would you like to? My whole point is that there is a double standard! "Yakub" gets pseudohistory but the Book of Mormon does not. Noone has answered my question about why this is ok. And as far as the Bible goes, enough of it has archeological evidence to back it up that it is safe to assume that there is unfound evidence that backing up the parts that have no arcehological evidence. Lets leave the Bible out of this discussion, this is not about the Bible. This is about the Book of Mormon. And I want my question answered: why does the story that Yakub created the white race on the isle of Patmos get labeled as pseudohistory (which has no evidence what so ever other then the beilf of an insane Islamic sect) but the story that the first inhabbitents of North America where Jewish (which has even less evidence going for it then the white race being the product of Yakub) dosen't? <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorbian_d8a7.html" title="User:Jorbian">Jorbian</a> 15:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that tagging both the Book of Mormon and the Yakub as a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_history.html" title="Sacred history">Sacred history</a> renders the question moot. In the case of sacred books, a NPOV would demand that it is neither presented as truth or untruth, but for what it is: a sacred writing that has meaning and context for a specific group regardless of its historic verifiability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Bible would also fall into this category of a sacred history. Yes, cities in the Bible have been uncovered, but the story of the creation, Eve from Adam’s rib, fall, flood, and etc., cannot be proven. Yet there are countless numbers of literalists who demand that it did happen just as it is written, and countless others who deny it emphatically. This, by the way, holds true for the Book of Mormon as well; there are many who claim that they have archeological evidence to support the claims in the book, and many like yourself who see no evidence.</dd>

<dd>Personally, for the sake of this article, I don’t really care either way. In order to be neutral, it is not the place of a wikipedian to state which of these viewpoints is correct, but rather be as functionally objective as possible in presenting both sides. This, of course, happens as multiple editors lend their expertise and are willing to work together.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I look forward to working with you on a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_history.html" title="Sacred history">Sacred history</a> article, and then tagging this and other articles. I will start out a stub, let’s do some research, and then go from there.

<dd>Yakub is no longer in the category so there is not a problem a double standard. I also removed several other articles from the category. As I covered with Rojerts, creating this new category may be the way to go if a category is necessary. The article may be better than creating a category. I would assist on the article also. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reading all this, I am not sure why this sparked such a vigorous debate. The <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakub.html" title="Yakub">Yakub</a> article clearly states that its considered "an allegory" and "a parable", not a factual history, by the NOI. However, the LDS have not said such about the Book of Mormon (as far as I know). Just a thought. I like the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_history.html" title="Sacred history">sacred history</a> article though. Good idea. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 22:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just wish that everyone would cite their sources and that neither side would lose their heads and either try to convert people or destroy what they believe. Neither is the place for an encyclopedia. If you have a rebuttal to something in this article, say it and cite it. Watch your tone. Watch your language use.
