<p>Hi Boothy, thanks for your reply at my Talk page concerning my RFA. You state "The answer to the general question posed to you have led me to the conclusion that you are unqualified for administrator privileges. Good/Popular editors do not equal qualified admin candidates." I would like to learn more about what you consider to be good qualifications for administrator. In addition to contributions to articles, I've logged over 400 edits to the project space concerning policy discussion, etc. I've also reverted quite a few vandals and innapropriate changes. Are there specific skills that you would like me to develop or specific actions that I could take that would allow you to support me as an admin in the future? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:16, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again. Thanks for your note. I think I understand where you are coming from now. Concerning policies, I think that administrators have to be careful to enforce existing policies <i>as they are today</i>, and not to allow their views of what policies <i>should be</i> to influence the way they enforce policy. They are still free to campaign for improvements, of course. If you have any questions about my views on particular policies, I'd be happy to adress them. Thanks again for your reply. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 23:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Boothy,</p>
<p>Thanks for participating in my RfA even if you felt you couldn't support. I know you're not very much into giving specifics for these, but I do want you to know that if you have a specific concern about my present or past behavior you'd like to let me know about, I'd be happy to talk about it.

<p>I saw your request at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>. First, I must advise you read over <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a>. An admin will not protect on their preferred version in an edit war, for obvious reasons. Page protection is <i>only</i> for instituting a cooling off period during a heated edit war, not for endorsing any version. It appears you have broken the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia:Three-revert rule</a> multiple times in Philadelphia-related articles today. Now, it's within my discretion to block you, but I'm going to give both you and Boothy this one last warning before doing so. Another revert and you will be blocked. Edit warring is always unacceptable. It is also pointless, you must realize, as anyone else can revert you just as readily as you can revert them. Please engage in discussion. And also note that a content dispute is <i>not</i> vandalism, see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#What vandalism is not</a>.

<dd>Your response is unwarranted. Do not make attacks against me or all admins. But more importantly, do not edit war. Ever. No one is <i>entitled</i> to any reverts at all. You shold go through the normal dispute resolution precess. I respect why you are here, but if that is true, edit warring is counter to that goal. It is <i>harmful</i>. Always. And this is not vandalism; it is a dispute over a category. For deliberately and egregiously violating my warning, I'm blocking both of you for 3RR. Do not edit war when you come back.

<dd>Oh no i belive that my responce is very warranted. You it is obvious bu your lack of action, and you action, as well as your own uncivil responce, that you do not respect why i am here. If you did then you would educate your self on what this dispute is about and uphold the the principal that should be the most important one to theis so called project and that is the the purvance of information that corect. As for entitled to reverting, i dont do it becuse i am entitled to do it, i do it becuse it needs to be done, and maybe you should remove your ablilty to revet any pages regardless of what the content is, but being that you have your pouplairty contest postion, that will never be disputed or challanged, i seriously doubt thatyou will. So i can only hope that their are no chnges in the mea time, becus i will change them to uphold the validity of information, regardlessof you ingnorance to the issue.

<p>Dear Boothy: Whilst I appreciate that you do not wish to be involved in the Philadelphia County mediation recently requested, I would like to please ask you not to edit other people's requests for mediation, even if you disagree with their presentation - no matter how bad faith you feel their request is, or your opinion of the actions of the user. Instead, I would be most grateful if you would voice your concerns as a separate comment on the mediation; if you don't wish to be involved in the mediation, that's also fine, but please just say so rather than editing requests made by other users. If there is any way I can assist you, please do ask.

I have seen people who have done far worse things things then myslef, only to have a blind eye turned to them or a slap on the writs. You have also wnet aginst your only policy by imposing this ban with out even an arbs com decision, which only goes to show that thei is no structue that works here and the the real power rest in the admins who serve as judge jury and exctionicure, by keeping me blcok you have also reused to try to engage me in any kind of defence aginst the blatent violitaions of blocking that has been permited. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 23:41, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Boothy - I agree you shouldn't be blocked, and I'll unblock you. That said, um, if you are currently blocked, how are you making edits to your talk page? Beyond this, this whole thing is completely puzzling to me. You were banned on the 4th, but hadn't made edits to any articles since Wednesday. On Wednesday, I see no 3RR violations at all - a bunch of single reverts to various articles relating to Philadelphia. What on earth is going on here? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:00, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright, having looked at WP:AN, I see a fair degree of support for the 72 hour block, and I don't want to do anything unilaterally. That said, the indefinite block was clearly unwarranted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:05, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also when you are on a blaock the only thing you are allowd to to is posted to your own user talk page, whish is usless in trying to defend your self. I have no problem with serving the first 48 hour, which i do belive as excessive, as well as the second 48 hour block as i did break the blockby useing a secondary account <a href="../../../c/i/s/User%7ECisum6cbb_fc4d.html" title="User:Cisum6cbb">User:Cisum6cbb</a> in order to revert changes by an anon, who from a similar address did the same reversions, that i belive to be <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">User:Evrik</a>, as it would match his m/o. That i am not contesting, what i am conttesting is the further abuse that i have had to be put threw by a groupe of useres who goal seems to be my eventual dismissal from wikipedia. I do hope that you examine the statemts that i have made at the top of the page, even though it is a rant, before making any decisions and that you wish to contact me further on this issue that you do so threw my email link. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 05:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While I believe the ArbCom should give an indef. block, after reviewing the situation, I also believe that one admin giving an infinite block represents an overstepping of authority. One month would probably be the longest an admin could arbitrarily give out for a user such as Boothy443 (Of course we have the ArbCom option). If he was a user like "nfsfnpsf" or "busheastnuts43" with a record of nothing but vandalism, then he could get blocked indef. by one admin. Although jtkiefer was acting in good-faith, so I see no reason to scold him.</dd>

<dd>And "Voice of the Oppressors" is simple refuted by reality(I love that line, but it is true here).

<p>Only a supporter of current power abusing admins would make a statment like that or someone that was looking to get some where, what do they call that term. An admin one that blocks other usersw with out consulting or an arbcoom decision is an admin is not asting in good faith, not like it matters becuse for the most part the admins have carte-blanche to do wwhat ever they want with no reprucissions at all, which is really sad. So their for any way jkiefer was not acting in good-faith, and i would consider taking further action aginst him, but their is no reason to bsuace their is no effective way to deal with admins who over step their pwer. My thing is, if you have to question what you did for a block, then you more then likely should have never did it in the first place. And as lie,"Coming from someone who almost never supports anything s/he says" and yes i am calling you a liar, you eiter chose not to read the above or you chose to ingnore it, or the more likely one bscuse i questioned the authority of the admins, apparenly they are the ones who do no wrong, or you just an asshole, i thik its a combo of the latter parts with a lot of tp. Now before you go all of, i know i am asshole, and i could care less. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 05:53, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"An admin one that blocks other usersw with out consulting or an arbcoom decision is an admin is not asting in good fait". I disagree; an admin can block for obvious 3RR/vandalism and for severe conduct issues. Indefinte blocks of obvious vandal accounts are ok by 1 admin. I don't like 1 admin giving an indef block in other circumstances though, especially after the user in question hasn't made many recent edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And remember SteveVertigo, who over stepped his admin powers and his sysop status placed up for bote again by arbcom(which actually was stupid, since they should have de-sysoped themselves, but that is not the point). He had a pile-on of oppose votes and the other votes where to have it go back to arbcom. So admins are still checked. The fact is that jtkiefer was acting in good faith and you know it, at least he <b>gave an explaination</b> for his block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mind if admins decisions are questioned with reasonable complaints, I dont mind getting reasonable criticism myself, but your complaints about "bitching" and your admission of being an "ass-hole" is just off the mark.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "almost never supporting anything", I was also refering to your RfA "No" votes, which you offered a partial explaination to only once or twice on two random candidate's talk pages. I said that you should at least give a link and you <b>ignored</b> me, just like you ignored others and even your RfC. Your votes were cold and uneccesary, as was your personal attack mail, and now you want to claim that admins are the bad people? Also, my comment was not used in a <b>vote</b>, that is what really gets me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From what I hear, you have made good edits in the past. Who are you? Anikan Sywalker? Why make a 180 degree turn?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also,(I noticed this after edit conflict) what claims against you (personal attack mail/civility) are not correct. Certainly you dont refute the blocks by other admins and Jimbo?<a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><b><font color="blue">Voice <font color="darkblue">of <font color="black">All</font></font></font></b></a> <sup><small><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All%28MTG%29_2563.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All(MTG)">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkred">Esperanza</font></a></small></sup> 06:18, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But You seemd to have little or no question with the indefiant block of me. I do have a problem with the blocking here, their is a policy the only real guideline is admin discression. And i am sorry but thats not sufficent,. At the rate that admins are created, which i see as similar to food samples being handed out at the supermarket, espically considering how they are approved, and espically considering that you are giving all this power, and it a lot of power, to peole that i am not sure that really know what to do with it or really dont seem want it, and that seems to be happing more and more, if you ask me,.</p>
<p>I dont know the ins and out of the SteveVertigo, but if that is the case it only goes to show that arbcom, another thing that needs to be revamped, is ineffective, But you look and thei have been what 5 maybe six total admins that have been de-opedsince early 2004, but yet you alomst ofn a dily basis you see question rising about their jugement calls and behaviours, and yet the only people that oversee their activity are their fellow admins, who also control rfc and rfa, and who i canusually only come out to support or and if oppose they do so weakly, or do nothing at all. And then if someone that is not an admin brings up a complaint thaey are for the most part dismissed, because of their own actions, even though the actions of the admin is just a questionable as the users. The way i see their is no reason why anyone on here should not be able to question actions by the admins w/o having the attack dogs released on them, and their is no reason why admins, is this is only pertaninig only to the powers that they are given not their edits to aticles, should not be held to a higher standard then regular users. Being an admin is a privdledge not a right, and it should be a privlidge that is taken away as easily as it is give, which as long as your a "good editor" who has at least 1000 edits to your belt and hanvt come to the ire of what seems to be a "working group" of admins and users you baiscaly a shoein which is sickining to me.</p>
<p>and no i dont find that jtkiefer was acting in good faith, I dont find reason to be one thats is enough to warrent the length of the block in the first place. It was uncalled for. Matter of fact i do have a problem with any admin putting a block on any account for longer then 24hours for any reason, withouth prior decision from armbcom, or the wikimedia board, nut something like that will never happen, and not becaus it not a good thing, it s that any time some one has brought up an idea of limiting the power of an admin, its been summiarly killed.</p>
<p>As for my complaints about "bithcing" and your admission of being an "ass-hole" being just off the mark, i dont see it that way, i have, not the same terms, been labed as being a ass by users and admins alike, and it has less to do with disputes of content or my addations of content to articles then it does with my ideas of the adminstrative structure of wikipedia and the way that i vote on on the admin elections. And they way i see it i have ever right to complain, based on the comments that i have seen that are about me and that i have seen made towards me, including several prior to this that would weclome my leaving the project, for nothing less then becuas i go aginst the grain on the rfa. I used to participate in the system, but i gave up on that based on the amount of bs that one has to dea with. Things like reporting vandalism, and nothing ever gets done with it, or being told well thats not vandalism enough, to a admin from switzerland, whose name i forget, complaing after i made a mistake on a report that, (and i am not going to get this totaly wrong), syaing that my reports were to legal for his tates, and that he didnt really take them seriously anyway, and even if he did say it, thats the way it sounded. To have an article re-werite to be thrown out becaus the subject, not the artcile, was the same, and to accuse me of recreating a deleted article, even thought this was a complete re-write, and should have been judged again on the merrits of the new information, but that shows you one of the places where vfd, and to be blocked for that. Ans then when i asked that some one show me how they were the same, it was refused, all by admins. I complained and fought the system, but you cant becaus it wolnt let you.</p>
<p>As for rfa, do you ask evey one why they support, no. But they give no real reason, other then "just because" reason, boy thats real constructive, and the idea that their are just for the nomination, and theat an oppose is not withouth written statement a statement is bs. I see no reson to justify my votes to any one really but myself, and the person involved, and even at that i dont see haveing to tell them anything more then i oppse their nomination. When you vote in any of you muni or whatever election, are you required to explain why you oppsed them in order to quailify their vote, and so that they have constructive critisim so theat they are better canidates when the run again, no.</p>
<p>And as for the &lt;blockquotes&gt;From what I hear, you have made good edits in the past. Who are you? Anikan Sywalker? Why make a 180 degree turn? You go trew my edit history and you tell me where the good edits to articles stops. Such a quote like thats is nothing more than an insult withouth fact.</p>
<p>But you know what, if i am so despisied here, and if you are all so eager and ready to get rid of me, the go ahead and file your rfa and get it over with, but dont expect me to give a responce or much of a care, becaus the only ting i see out of is is being draged threw the mud, becuas i think different then power structure does and when i get pissed of and pushed into a corner, or when i think i am being treated unfailry or with a bais i lash out. And i am tired of addressing this issue, becaus in the end i amgoing to be the bad guy, and thats thats. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 09:39, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Boothy, it would really behoove you to calm down, and slow down (the spelling in these posts is really atrocious, for one thing - incredibly bad. I don't mean to sound flip, but it really does become hard to take someone seriously when they spell as badly as you do in the comments above). At any rate, what good does the lengthy ranting about admin conspiracies do you? It is just alienating and makes you look bad. Why not just wait out the block, and then try to avoid 3RR rule violations in the future, and see how you do? In terms of your complaints about admin abuse, perhaps it would be wise to try to come up with a cogent, and succinct, and spell-checked, explanation of what you think is wrong with the current situation, and how you think it can be fixed, instead of just attacking admins you feel are conspiring against you? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:19, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For those who want to bitch about me any behavior in which they don't like which seem to be so disruptive to wikipedia, or if you want to see personal attacks and uncivil behavior made and condone by admins and the fellow supporters, like <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_UninvitedCompany_e57c.html" title="Special:Contributions/UninvitedCompany">contribs</a>), you can see a comment he made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUninvitedCompany&amp;diff=27399744&amp;oldid=26925532" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUninvitedCompany&amp;diff=27399744&amp;oldid=26925532" rel="nofollow">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJtkiefer&amp;diff=27399140&amp;oldid=27386237 here</a>, or by the person that blocked me <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> (<a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer">contribs</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUninvitedCompany&amp;diff=27399744&amp;oldid=26925532" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUninvitedCompany&amp;diff=27399744&amp;oldid=26925532" rel="nofollow">here</a> please go to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Boothy443_Indef._blocked" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Boothy443_Indef._blocked</a>, and that goes for admins and non admins.

<p>It should also be know that i have been put behind an indefiendt block, imposed by one administrator Jtkiefer that has less to do with policy violations is is just a way to suppress me for as i see it, not playing by their "rules", or to put it, falling in line like a good Wikipedian, and that i called out an admins <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> (<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmcdevit_521b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmcdevit">contribs</a>) for what i perceived as his biased enforcement of a 3rr block on the pages , <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_County%2C_Pennsylvania_1728.html" title="Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhiladelphia_County%2C_Pennsylvania_3378.html" title="Category:Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania">Category:Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

If enforcement is for one then it should be for all. It about time as users that we stop being the lapdogs to the great leader Jimmy and the admins, and start taking back the power when it comes to the running of this site, because it might be me today, but tommrow it could be you. Since i can no longer effectively communicate on here, i have opened the ability to have other useres email me, only email me if you have something constructive to say or want to discuss, i am also open to discussion with useres in projects that i am involed in and will continue to be involed in as well, but only threw email , untill my account is rightfully restored. The best things would be to finally see a admin step up and right this wrong and put abusive admnis in their place. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 01:04, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boothy, you are free to "bitch" about admins as well. Just not to edit war, make personal attacks, or use sockpuppets. Which is why your block was extended. Saying that I didn't block the IP is a lie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:172.156.2.190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:172.156.2.190" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which you have now repeated. I did not extend Evrik's block because after his block, the autoblocker blocked a non-AOL IP, while the IP was AOL. I wasn't certain they were teh same person. I knew it was your sockpuppet. Also, there is <i>no</i> problem in posting material to help with dispute resolution, when a user was blocked for that dispute and cannot do so. The block is not there to stop the resolution, but the dispute. "<i>It a fucking shame that abusive, non-impartial, vandal promoting admins like your self cant be removed.</i>" not only "could be constued as a nasty letter," but <i>is one</i>. Try owning up, it helps your credibility. I am perfectly willing to be help accountable for my admin decisions, and discuss them transparently. Which is why your words are all the more mystifying. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:35, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I dont have to worrie about my credibility, The comments that have been posted on the ANI and other pages, by users, mainly admins, that have never, never addressed me, with what should be considered as uncivil comments, have already set my credibilty and have show that their is a complete bias aginst me, which has been futher show by the actions taken aginst me, which for site adminstration is unacceptable, and that is a fucking shame.

<p>Hey Boothy, yes I was struggling for a bit to put some nave boxes for my Metrlonik stations project, but I've set them up as incumbant series which for now seems to work pretty well. I'm going to try to get the whole system fleshed out, and then go back to fill in on it. (hopefully with some help) I would love some help with the Wash Metro style boxes. I'll get back to you when I'm ready tackle that.</p>

<dd>The comments above , which have been stricken from the record will be continue to be for being nothing but trollish and sticking his nose into other person conversations, are unsupported by any facts and are just total POV. First off he complains about personal attacks, yet demands that not participate in wikipedia because their opinions are not that of majority rule, or the corruption of the word consensus which s applied on a ever day use. FYI the detention of consensus in the world outside of wikipedia is "An opinion or position reached by a group as a whole" this is usually take after negogaations between the parties involved. In wikipedia, though this is not stated but how it is used in working, "An opinion or position reached by a majority of users, a majority being defined as an arbitrary number greater then 50%, in a vote or threw a poll in which their is little or no relevant discussion, and that the position of the majority should be taken as the position of the group as a whole". Therefor calling anything a consensus on wikipedia is nothing but false and misleading, but thats nothing new here. Next the users states that he is only following policy in regard to his deletion request based on <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_namespace_8f91.html" title="Wikipedia:Template namespace">Wikipedia:Template namespace</a>. It should be noted that <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_namespace_8f91.html" title="Wikipedia:Template namespace">Wikipedia:Template namespace</a> is not a policy (it is not marked as a policy nor as a guideline), and their for can not be enforced as one nor is it marked as even a guideline, at the most it is a tutorial assisting user in what that can use templates for and how to create them, therefor enforcing an deletion request as enforcement as a policy of guideline is false and misleading, but is that a surprise as that happens every day on wikipedia. Also that the templates are in violation of NPOV and NOT, which is also false in that none of the Irish templates is in violation of NOT or NPOV, the same can not be said of *fD which are constantly in violation of NOT (which is a policy) in the fact that they use voting as their only method of decision making and consensus via discussion, also as these are votes or polls/ any decision they render is non-binding, therefor anyone can recreate any of the "deleted" items at will as the decision on the all of the *fD, and the the so called enforcement of the decisions at these *fD pages put any user in violation of NOT
<blockquote>
<p>"Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy. Its primary method of <b>finding consensus</b> is <b>discussion</b>, <b>not voting</b>. In difficult cases, straw polls may be conducted to help determine consensus, but are to be used with caution and <b>not to be treated as binding votes</b>."</p>
</blockquote>
Also to state that any of the templates meets the cretiera on DP is also false, the only thing that this would wall under is "A redundant or misguided series box" but their is no cretiera in which defines a "misguided series box" or what it is, and that none of these boxes are part of any series of any other boxes, as i would define it would lead me to say that they are not cretiera for deletion except as a NPOV violated request. Also the naming of the user as a deletionist is correct based upon his actions, which directly condtricit the statements that he makes on his own user page, but is not not a surprise. Itr should also be noted that the useres philsophies and his actions are in violation of policy as well, he states he is a commonsensist (LOL) which should actucally be a conformists which based on his statements and actions he beilves in. The peoblem is conformity, as he wants to enforce it, goes aginst NOT (see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] in that it is imposing a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" rel="nofollow">CREEP</a>. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 21:40, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your rant is patently false, and provably so. Please stop engaging in uncivil behaviour, and refrain from making further personal attacks.

<li><i>First off he complains about personal attacks, yet demands that not participate in wikipedia because their opinions are not that of majority rule,</i> Actually, I <i>suggested</i> (not <i>demanded</i>) that you read some relevant policy documents and guidelines before continuing to participate in TfD (and only TfD).

<li><i>Also that the templates are in violation of NPOV and NOT, which is also false in that none of the Irish templates is in violation of NOT or NPOV,</i> Again, please point out exactly where I said that the Irish templates themselves were somehow in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</li>

<li><i>Also the naming of the user as a deletionist is correct based upon his actions,</i> Making blind, uninformed, assumptions and applying disparaging labels about other users is <i>never</i> correct, per <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, as well as general <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>.</li>
