<p>Very interesting, but do they call it a 'booze cruise' in Scandinavia?. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 10:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They probably call them "spritresor" or similar, but we can't use that on English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBIL_6577.html" title="User:BIL">BIL</a> 22:13, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the US I've heard the term "booze cruise" applied to something also known as a "cruise to nowhere", wherein a boat will just sail for a few hours, loiter about, and then return to harbor. Generally the price of all-you-can-drink alcohol is included in the ticket. These are also popular in outside-of-the-US destinations where minors go on Spring Break, such as Cancun. I'll try to dig up some examples and update the bottom of the page. --<a href="../../../j/d/7/User%7EJD79_8d62.html" title="User:JD79">JD79</a> 23:38, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many thanks for your contribution. Not sure of this though: <i>"French tobacco duties have also risen, reducing further the economic advantage of a "booze cruise". Unless one is close to the Channel ports, it's unlikely to be financially beneficial. The motivation is changing, therefore, from purely economic to leisure and variety of choice".</i> I live 150 miles from Dover. Since the French Govt raised tobacco duty, I now buy my tobacco in Adinkerke and fill the boot with Wine in Calais. Apart from the need to admire the stunning scenery around Dunkirk (?) twice from the motorway, the economic advantage remains the same. Happy Cruisin'&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 11:42, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not a smoker so can't speak for that. Last time I did a "cruise" (from Hemel Hempstead), as opposed to stopping on the way home, I had to note the costs (for the first time). I was surprised that there was little or no advantage, more so since Fench petrol has also increased in price. On yesterday's R5 phone-in, one former smuggler reported that it had ceased to be worth his time and risk to import beer for resale. I'll still go, however, for leisure and variety reasons - hence not being attracted by Adinkerke instead of Boulogne. Other people do report the same. I'd stand by my comment: it's not an absolutist statement - it records a change in emphasis. Nice that this article has attracted interest. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 18:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that. Yes I agree that the main benefit now is for smokers, as the percentage savings to be had on tobacco at Adinkerke are far greater than the savings to be had on wine or beer at Calais, unless you buy wine in very big quantities. In fact at Adinkerke, a large proportion of the number plates are actually French nowadays. We just stop off in Calais on the way, to pick up wine at about 60% of the UK price. i agree that it wouldn't really be worth us driving all the way from W Berks for the saving on wine alone. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 19:06, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is probably only true for the UK. Swedish citizens can still save a lot of money by going to other countries when purchasing alcohol. For example, Baltic prices can be very low. (Stefan2 01:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Again, fascinating, but this page is about the British coloquial term 'Booze Cruise'. It is not intended to be an article about cross-border shopping throughout the world. If the good people of Sweden find it cheaper to buy alcohol in the Baltic States, that's fine, but the Swedes must have their own Swedish word for what they do. Please create a Swedish-language page for this.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 09:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not a new law. It was from 2005. Can you tell us why it has only been inserted into the article now?. Has the introduction of the law been 'delayed' until now, or have the French Customs only recently started to enforce it?. I've been over to Calais / Adinkerke at least ten times since then. The car park at Adinkerke is still full of French number plates, and I have not noticed anything different, or ever been more than glanced at by French customs either going in or out. I have, however, been quizzed at Dover Customs about 'where I have been to' in France. As I thought that my passport was valid for the whole of the country; I have written to both UK Customs and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask them for a list of places that I am not allowed to go to in France. I'll let you know. I know that HM Customs have powers that the Police can only dream of, but nevertheless, a Police Officer (although he may ask you the question) cannot actually demand an answer to it unless he cautions you first. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 08:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The law did pass the French legislature in 2005 but it only became active law in 2006 - it's at least quite new. There's been a lot of discussion about whether or not the law is enforced and it's actually quite tricky to be certain one way or another: there are verified stories of British tobacco tourists losing their 3600 cigarettes (and French tobacco tourists experiencing confiscations) but other stories exist of tobacco tourists being stopped, asked for car insurance documents and then not being subjected to a search or being searched at the Tunnel or ferry port and being allowed on their way. One thing is certain: the tobacco sellers association is using political pressure to ensure that the law is enforced. It's a crude law in terms of serving 1 interest group's agenda but it also presents itself as health conscious legislation - an attempt to reduce tobacco consumption in order to promote health and in doing so it frames tobacco rather like cannabis (in a way). It's a very clever move by the very interest group that wants to sell as much tobacco as possible! Some respectable legal opinions suggest that because the law pretends to be about health promotion it may well avoid undue censure by the EU/European Commission. The Commission is very angry about the law (it raises fundamental questions about the integrity of the EU and the ability of nation state governments to legislate according to a meta state agenda). The French Government wishes that the law would go away. But it won't. It's the law and whilst you may (and probably will) get away with breaking it you risk losing your load (although probably not your vehicle) if you do. It's an important part of the story and people need to be aware of the issues.</p>

<dd>Thanks for that. Recommend that if you do get goods confiscated, to obtain and keep both proof of legitimate purchase and confiscation receipts very safe, so we can drag them through European courts later as part of group action. Whether you love or loath Gordon Brown and HM Customs, at least they do observe the law as it stands, even if they don't like it&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 17:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
