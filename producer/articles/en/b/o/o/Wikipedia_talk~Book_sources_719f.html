<p>I've written a <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunchboxhero_monobook.js_dc56.html" title="User:Lunchboxhero/monobook.js">function that rewrites ISBN links to the url of your choice</a>. This will allow folks to bypass Book Sources if they always want to go to the same external site every time. To enable this, copy the code and paste it in your user JS page, i.e. <b>User:&lt;Your User Name&gt;/monobook.js</b>. My script rewrites the url to amazon, but you can easily modify the script to rewrite to the url of your choice. Looking at the source of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBooksources_b5a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Booksources">Wikipedia:Booksources</a> can give you hints as to what that url should look like.</p>

<p>when one clicks a isbn link here, one wants to see the book on a page of choice (example amazon or any other selected page of choice) with first, maximum second click WITHOUT SCROLLING</p>
<p>today at 11 dec 2005 a frustrating 150.000 byte page opens, where one has to scroll down, HAVE TO SEARCH for amazon or your favorite book shop, HAVE TO SEARCH WHERE TO CLICK</p>
<p>this is a very distracting <b><a href="../../../u/s/a/Usability.html" title="Usability">Usability</a></b></p>
<p>i suggest a link to the 3 most used book providers appears on first lines WITHOUT SCROLLING.</p>
<p>to avoid useless server load and wait time for narrow-band users i even suggest to SPLIT the page.</p>
<p>3 Links for Quick access, the 150.000 bytes for all who want do dig deeper with an extra link.</p>
<p>or best, integrate it in <b>my preferences</b> every registered user selects a book page of choice, no more frustrating intermediate 150.000 byte page. (150.000 bytes are a complete 100 page book) <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaming_46ea.html" title="User:Roaming">roaming</a> 11 Dec 2005</p>
<p><br />
i copied a9 search from the metalist from SOMEWHERE from this too long page <b>on top for easy point and click,</b></p>
<p>(maybe someone replaces it by a better meta searchengine or extends line by max. 2 more direct links to the aimed isbn book)</p>
<p>so if one just wants to take a quick look on a book one has neither to install javascript nor need for scrolling and looking and aiming</p>
<p>where one has to klick and point to get ahead. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaming_46ea.html" title="User:Roaming">roaming</a> 15 Dec 2005</p>

<dd>I agree with you, this page is too long and confusing. But it's a reason to improve wikipedia (reorganize the page, make subpages, whatever), not to advertise one vendor - even if A9 is of good quality. wikipedia is neutral, and even if the user came here mostly to get a link to amazon, we shouldn't support one vendor. <small>for a Nielsen Zealot, you're quite hard to read&#160;;-)</small> --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Lacoste_5910.html" title="User:Marc Lacoste">Marc Lacoste</a> 16:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>it's a disaster; if there's only a choice between the three most popular, they will become EVEN MORE popular.
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand clearly what do you mean. I think we will need to remove this A9 link, or to place it in metasearches. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Lacoste_5910.html" title="User:Marc Lacoste">Marc Lacoste</a> 17:36, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I come to this section on usability and all I see is consensus to remove the link. I think it would be okay if we could cycle through all of the book shops which claim to have "most" available books in their catologue. If we have to prefer one then we shouldn't have the link.

<p>I'm very new to this so forgive me this is a yawn inducingly old idea.</p>
<p>I've noted the way books are to be cited, and the page which clicking an ISBN number takes you to.</p>
<p>I also note that this provides a source of funding as some click-thrus will give Wikipedia money for any sales made on referral.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, you can see an example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0123456789" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0123456789" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>What I was wondering is, would there be any value in having a <b>Book Citation Drive</b> to <b>push up the number of book sales that Wikipedia earns commission on</b>?</p>
<p>Of course, we would want to make sure additions are relevant - you can see the 3 I've added to the <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dad%27s_Army_b681.html" title="Dad's Army">Dad's Army</a> article at <i>Further Reading</i></p>
<p>I figured if you had a splash on the front page and some other reminders strategically placed, it might cause an increase in citations and funds.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be gung-ho about it, Wikipedia could be a lot more aggressive in funneling click-thrus to those retailers Wikipedia can get money from - but I suspect that's against the spirit of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 01:45, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, shortly after the amazon partner link was added as an experiment Jimbo declared the experiment as being over as the income generated was quite small - and probably also because some wikipedians issued bad feelings about working together with amazon, as the patent policy of amazon is somewhat controversial. However that link wasn't removed even after the experiment was declared over, so maybe Jimbo should check again if it gained any significant income since.</dd>
<dd>But even if there were no affiliation programs used, adding books in a "resources" or "further reading" section makes perfect sense, as well as adding the ISBN for books which are listed already but lack that number. I myself do that regularily, but I limit myself to books I have read, so I can recommend that book to a topic. Searching through amazon to find a book related to the topic of an article just to add book title is not a good idea IMHO. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 19:58, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I added Harvard HOLLIS since this is one of the biggest union catalogs in the U.S. (by number of books, not number of libraries). I also added San Francisco Public Library for people local here in SF who want to find books.</p>
<p>The public access to WorldCat is a great idea, but I've found a number of books just in my work over the last week that are in fact in WorldCat, but don't come up on the WorldCat+Google search. Anyone know why this is? Google hasn't indexed it all?</p>
<p>I noticed that on the wikibooks server, you can't edit the Book sources page, and there aren't many book sources listed there (only commercial providers too). Where is the wikibooks village pump, or who should I talk to about this?</p>

<li>An answer to an old question: but the reason some books don't come up in Open WorldCat is that all the WorldCat records were not released to the public by <a href="../../../o/c/l/OCLC_c9d6.html" title="OCLC">OCLC</a> -- they only gave a limited slice to the public, versus the full catalog you can find in the very expensive WorldCat subscription that your library may have.

<p>Greetings, all.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/e/t/IETF_8156.html" title="IETF">IETF</a> defines a standard method of referencing books in hypertext documents via the <a href="../../../u/r/n/URN_1596.html" title="URN">urn:isbn</a> namespace. Some browsers and extensions already support this. As it becomes more widely implemented, Wikipedia users will come to expect that when they click on an <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> in Wikipedia, the link will be handled by the browser rather than by this special Wikipedia page. In the interim, I thought it would be best to provide a urn: link at the top of this article (see sample text below, which would have replaced the first paragraph). However, it appears that Mediawiki does not recognize links of the form [urn:…]. I'll file a bug report with Mediawiki and hopefully this will be resolved soon.</p>

<p>This list should be limited to national or state libaries. If we all started adding regional libraries the list would become too large and unusable.</p>

<dd>See, this is the thing. The New York Public Library is immense - half a million books in Slavic languages alone, half a million <i>maps</i>, four specialised research libraries, eighty-five branches, fifty million items of which twenty are books - it doesn't just put most university libraries behind it, it outweighs a lot of <i>national</i> libraries. Yet it's only one of three public library services in a single American city. Making broad judgements on the "level" isn't helping here. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 13:44, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would go with practical usefulness to our users rather than rules about whether certain types of libraries are allowed or not.

<p>Will users intuitively look for entries according to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_English_speaking_population_45b9.html" title="List of countries by English speaking population">a mere list of anglophone countries by total population</a> (not by anglophone population)? Moreover, organising it that way while alphabetically listing other countries in other regions (of which the anglophone countries are part of) doesn't make much sense. Lastly, the country list has no <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited sources</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, I've restored the prior logical alphabetical listing. E Pluribus Anthony 14:02, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi E. Pluribus Anthony,</p>
<p>Here's my concern:</p>
<p>Probability would seem to say that more users of the English Wikipedia come from countries that have large English-speaking population. We are going to get a lot more visitors to this page from Canada than we are from the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>So, let's make it easier for most visitors to this page to find the listings that are appropriate for them, and let's do this by putting them at the top of the page.</p>
<p>There were only nine countries that were on the list countries by English speaking population, and also had entries on this page, so I don't think that's unnavigable.</p>
<ul>
<li>United States</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>South Africa</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with you it would be better to have a list of anglophone population, however I think using a list of countries with English as an official language is an acceptable proxy. While I think a citations would be useful, the above ranking of country size certainly passes my sanity test.</p>
<p>I think that it is okay to have two different kinds of organizations of country libraries, especially if we put a clear explanation for our reasoning.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I totally disagree with this proposal/rationale:
<ul>
<li>the prior listing/order is erroneous and subjective, one that doesn't at all fulfill a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_least_astonishment.html" title="Principle of least astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">skins the cat unnecessarily</a>; <i>q.v.</i> <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglosphere.html" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> for how subjective these notions can be</li>
<li>the list is as yet incomplete and growing: what about countries like <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, with arguably as many or more anglophones as the others, or the <i><b>40+</b></i> countries where English is official or a <i><a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_franca.html" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a></i>? By what criteria should they be ordered? Obviate any ambiguity and organise them all in a consistent manner</li>
<li>even if a complete list for countries and related populations was complete or available (and I've given thought to updating one), many of the links connect to non-anglophone book sources/collections that possess non-anglophone works</li>
<li>why don't we sort the list by population <i>within</i> countries too? By city proper, metro area, anglophone population? Or how about by the size of each source/collection?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Arguably, alphabetisation may also be subjective but at least it's one a Wikipedian need only have knowledge of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_alphabet.html" title="English alphabet">English alphabet</a> to comprehend.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One person's sanity is another's insanity. Until compelling reasons are forthcoming or a groundswell thinks otherwise, an alphabetical listing – as is the case currently – is the best option. E Pluribus Anthony 15:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi E. Pluribus Anthony,</p>
<p>Hello. I'll also respond in-text below:</p>
<p>Point by point:</p>
<p>First point: This is the disagreement we currently are having, not an supporing argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm unsure what this means, but the proposal is based on an incomplete list and other similar ordering schemes are equally subjective (see below). E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 23:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Second point: At present, there are no entries on this page for India or Pakistan. If such an entry was included, I would welcome it. Ideally, I would like to see the top ten countries, by visitation of the English Wikipedia, at the top of this page. As the traffic information for that is not readily available, I think that the scheme I have attempted gets part of the way there. It is not necessary and, I agree, a bad idea to order all countries by population of English speakers. The majority of traffic to the English Wikipedia comes from a handful of countries, and if we make it easier for visitors from those countries to find a relevant libraries, that would be an excellent thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>I realise that these two countries are not yet included. However, an alphabetical listing will allow for the easy addition/consultation of countries no matter where they are (and arguably, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_nation.html" title="Transcontinental nation">what continent they belong to</a>), instead of one where a determination has to be made about whether it should be in the English or non-English list. It's possible that anglophone Wikipedians in other countries, particularly non-native speakers or those who are multilingual, may use Wp and this resource (with concomitant traffic) ... and they might have some difficulty locating respective countries in an excessively parsed list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A clickable map might be better or can be used in concert with a list ... but of course this requires a visitor to effectively know where they are on a map. E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 23:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Third point: Yes, however the aim of the the English-ordering scheme is not to make it easier to find anglophone works, but to help users of the English Wikipedia to get to links to libraries within their country, whether those collections be anglophone or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the aim of such a scheme is to increase the utility for this page and feature for users. This is currently a listing of <i>book sources</i> by country (actually by continent, then by country, et al.), not a listing of book sources by language of country. Thus, an arbitrary listing of English-speaking countries (in a list forever incomplete) is more complex than one based on a more fundamental understanding - that of the English alphabet and where you are or what country you're looking for (pt. 4). If the list must be sorted by language, anglophone countries should be sorted alphabetically, and then non-anglophone ones too: apples with apples, not oranges. E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 23:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fourth point: If we knew what the most popular links were within countries, it does not seem like a bad idea to make those links more prominent. However, I do not think it is necessary to do this, because the number of links within countries is presently manageable in the current configuration. In comparison, the Book sources page is acknowledge as over long and difficult to use. And, with an alphabetized scheme, some of the countries that an user of English Wikipedia is most likely from, at the bottom or near the bottom of the list: UK, Canada, and the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>While we can make assumptions, we don't really know this or that, and it's <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">foolhardy to make extraneous assumptions</a>. And whether the list is unwieldy due to ordering, mere size, or another factor is subjective and methinks undetermined. Perhaps a discussion/RfC should be conducted regarding the list? E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 23:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think it is astonishing to find at the top of this page links to a handful of countries that people know have large Anglophone populations:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>South Africa</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, it would be inappropriate to order all countries by this scheme, but it seems an improvement in usability to make the countries from which most of visitors originate more prominent. Alphabetization obviously also has a place, and perhaps these two ideas can co-exist without making the page too much longer. Either, we can the above list at the top of the page and have them be links to sections within the alphabetized scheme. Or we can have these sections be at the top of the page and put links back up to them in the alphabetized scheme.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunchboxhero_303d.html" title="User:Lunchboxhero">User:Lunchboxhero</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I disagree, but can be compelled otherwise. In summary, I feel the proposal places primacy on sorting by language that, while reasonable to some, is arguably not the best way to go and introduces assumptions that a visitor needn't or shouldn't have to make. Apply an equal standard and sort to all countries, and you preclude any ambiguity by doing so. Thanks!

<p>Dear E Plurbus Anthony,</p>
<p>I never thought my scheme appropriate for the ordering of all countries, but instead as a way to make the this page more useful to the bulk of the visitors of the English Wikipedia who come from a handful of countries. However, I take your point that that different orders for different countries may be confusing. With that in mind, what do you think of this <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBook_sources_Reorganization_6ba6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Book sources/Reorganization">draft rewrite</a>, where the links in the sidebar point to the country sections which are alphabetized according to your layout.</p>

<dd>At second blush, I tweaked the quicklinks: I wikified <i>Libraries</i> (consistent with <i>Booksellers</i>, though I realise it's at the top of the article) and nixed the <i>English-speaking territories</i> wikilink (since, functionally, this differs from the other wikilinks in the box).

<p>What can we do to make this page more concise and usable? Two areas that could be improved simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Table of Contents could be rewritten to take up much less space without loss of important information.
<dl>
<dd>I think the TOC should remain as is (remember: users can hide it); instead, enhance the quicklink box and include <i>only</i> top-level notions and categories; otherwise, it would get unwieldy and redundant.

</dl>
</li>
<li>There is a section for <b>Metasearches of many online booksellers</b> which is followed by another section <b>Searches across several online booksellers</b>. Could these be combined?
<dl>
<dd>I think the current dichotomy is fine, but that's not to say those two sections can't be reorganised somehow. By what criteria? What will a user infer/intuit? Since the two sections are one atop the other, I think the current quicklink to the top is fine as is, however.

<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you are right, but what is the current dichotomy? If it is number of booksellers that you are searching across, than many of of the site are presently miscategorized. I would propose distinguishing between sites that aggregate the results from other online sites like Allbookstores.com and those that sites whose catalogs include merchants who do not have an independent web presence like Abebooks.
<dl>
<dd>The current dichotomy is that of the two sections you initially indicated. As I said, however, perhaps both can be reorganised differently/functionally – maybe by mere online portals of bookseller information (comparing prices), <i>bona fide</i> booksellers, publishers ...&#160;?

<p>Thanks to all who have inserted obscure search engines in the hope of increasing their own sales, or due to some misguided notion of completeness at the expense of usability; who have arbitrarily reordered the discussion, and removed comments that might help someone figure out which search engines are useful, especially those who have revised some items but not others. This page is now officially useless for anyone actually hoping to use the listings find a book.</p>
<p>Help us make it better. In the past few weeks we have been able to shorten the page considerably, and we have added a link that tells people how they can bypass the page altogether. Still, I agree that this page has gotten much too long. Perhaps if we agreed to put a limit the length of this page, that would help us figure out what is important and what is not.

<dd>There are many more universities and public libraries on the list than there are random booksellers which people will get commissions from. The page seems to be oriented to helping people find the book more than marketing the book to people as if they are customers or something. Pointing people at public libraries or universities which they have ready access to seems like a noble thing for this page to do. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 03:23, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't think the solution is to eliminate catalogs which may be useful for some users or to consider some catalogs better/more important than others. I think the solution is to put regional catalogs into subpages.--141.140.6.103 00:18, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can definitely see where querying libraries/resources on the regional level would be very convenient... Why not split this page into large resources and medium resources, where large are national and medium are regional? i.e., for United States, have a list of the largest resources, then a link to a regional page which is indexed by state. It's always nice to know when a book is available locally.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The main page should list the key links--big booksellers, worldcat, wikibooks, etc.--and the rest of it should be divided into regional pages. People could still set their prefs to go directly somewhere.--141.140.6.103 00:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we have something like this for Bible references?</p>
<p>We have a template:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{bibleref|John|1:1}} = <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20John&amp;verse=1:1&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20John&amp;verse=1:1&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">John 1:1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But that just links to Biblegateway.com and defaults to a particular version (currently the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_International_Version_2847.html" title="New International Version">New International Version</a>).</p>
<p>The problem with Biblegateway.com is that it contains only Conservative Protestant translations - the New Revised Standard Version, accepted by liberal Protestants, the Orthodox church, and the Roman Catholic church, is not there. Nor are the main Roman Catholic translations like the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jerusalem_Bible_5ebf.html" title="New Jerusalem Bible">New Jerusalem Bible</a>. Some of these non-Conservative Protestant versions are available legitimately online (I think the vatican website has an online copy of one of the Roman Catholic versions, for example).</p>
<p>And Protestant Bibles don't contain things like the Books of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirach.html" title="Sirach">Sirach</a>, or <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiasticus.html" title="Ecclesiasticus">Ecclesiasticus</a>, so you cant use the template to link to verses from them. This is quite biased against everyone who isn't a Conservative Protestant, so the only way really to be fair is to have something like this page.</p>

<li>To clarify: ISSN searches don't actually work in most of the sources listed on this page with the code that is generated, as ISBN and ISSN records are handled differently in library catalog records (and many bookstore records) (they're in different fields). Since the script is sending an "ISBN" request, the catalog that you're searching goes out looking for an ISBN (rather than an ISSN), doesn't come up with any ISBNs that match, and gives you no results. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 20:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Now that OCLC has released worldcat.org (free access to WorldCat), could we make OCLC number linking an option? I don't know exactly how that would work, since this page assumes ISBNs.

<p>Reviving the <a href="../../../i/s/s/ISSN_0f3e.html" title="ISSN">ISSN</a> search request from last year, as noted above:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be a separate page/form to search on ISSNs, as they are in different fields from ISBNs in most library catalog records. Wikipedia:Periodical sources as suggested above isn't a terrible title.</li>
<li>ISSNs are important: when trying to disambiguate a journal that's changed names a lot, or find something obscure, they can be incredibly useful</li>
<li>I'd suggest adding open worldcat, the big libraries listed on this page, and <a href="http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de" class="external text" title="http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de" rel="nofollow">the ZDB database</a> (as used on <a href="../../../i/s/s/Template%7EISSN_6b44.html" title="Template:ISSN">Template:ISSN</a>). Listing bookstores is less useful for these publications, though not completely useless...</li>
</ul>
<p>It shouldn't be too hard to reformat the URLs of library catalogs &amp; whatnot from the booksources page to search for ISSNs rather than ISBNs. Is anyone interested in working on this? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 21:19, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added justbooks.co.nz. I have no connection to them, other then buying 2 books from them recently. (I choose them after looking at most NZ online book sellers I could find and finding them the cheapest, at least for the books I was looking at. They did sell below the RRP and quite a few don't, some are even higher. They also had the best international shipping costs as I was sending these books overseas).</p>
<p>Anyway, before I added it, I had a brief look through this page. One issue that concerns me is that there doesn't appear to be any guideline as to how to decide whether to add a site. This issue comes up in other areas of wikipedia of course, especially external links and lists/comparisons of e.g. software. Sometimes I've seen people suggest we only allow mention of (in this case it would be book sellers) who have a wikipedia article. Or we could just leave it as is and hope this doesn't get too spammy and/or too unwiedly just to people adding their favourite sites. And if it does, just wait until people raise objections. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Back on December 23, 2006 Bookser added the custom form. It DOES NOT do anything that a regular google site-specific search doesn't do, other than show an Amazon link and Adsense Ads.

<p>That form sends the revenue to an Amazon partner by the name of "chuvashiaportal". I can't find any evidence that this is the worldcat project.

<p>In case people haven't noticed, the is English Wikipedia.What possible reason is there for this to link to sooooo many sites in other countries, and especially the ones that aren't even in English? I think this needs to be pared down? 216.165.158.7 03:11, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't need several hundred links to foreign language sites on this page to "get information on non-English books" -- and how many non-English books are even on English Wikipedia? There must be some link most likely to get information on most things, there would seem to be no purpose for the huge long list of every podunk library in the world. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 19:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Trellis (University of Waterloo, Guelph, Laurer) seems to have an embedded session ID that was only valid for ten minutes. Not sure if there's a way to get the right page w/o such an ID.</p>
