<p>Hi Bookandcoffee - just a note to say that I notice you've been putting a few geo-stub messages on articles (which is good!). There are lots of subcategories of geo-stub (all listed at the top of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeography_stubs_7ab2.html" title="Category:Geography stubs">Category:Geography stubs</a>), almost all of them in the form "country-geo-stub". I know it's difficult to remember which countries have or have not got them, but if you could put the more specific stubs on it'd help even more!

<p>Yeah, it looks like we did a good job of them!</p>
<p>I found it was a good way for me to learn what categories were available, and learn a little about editing. I was dismayed that of 50-60+ A entries, I was only able to make content contributions to three of them; and I was only able to make real content contributions to one. It's dismaying to me that there's such a vast number of artcles around, and so many of them are on subjects I don't know... and so many of the ones I do know, at least at first glance, appear to be "complete". (though I'm proud of the bits I did on <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archmage.html" title="Archmage">Archmage</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/k/Enkidu.html" title="Enkidu">Enkidu</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_universe_%28fan_fiction%29.html" title="Alternative universe (fan fiction)">Alternative universe (fan fiction)</a>.

<p>I had started disambiguating the <a href="../../../g/p/d/GPD_8cbe.html" title="GPD">GPD</a>-page this afternoon, while you changed the page to a redirect. I didn't notice your comment on the Talks-page. I need to revert this, so I can finish the job using the pywikipedia-bot. Also, you discarded the GDP as <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guanosine_diphosphate.html" title="Guanosine diphosphate">guanosine diphosphate</a>, which has lots of links. (some to GDP)</p>

<p>Not all the number-related edits are clearly malicious, but they are all useless and some of them are wrong. The IP also has several vandalism warnings on its talk page, so apparently others have decided those edits (or others?) were malicious. I'm not sure what to do, except delete pointless links and wrong redirects. Probably letting things like <a href="../../../2/7/0/2700.html" title="2700">2700</a> link to <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_century.html" title="27th century">27th century</a> stand is okâ€”those don't much matter. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 09:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note also that when I get the contributions for the IP address, there also seem to be edits by a legitimate user. Our person-who-would-seem-to-be-a-vandal-except-for-<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> seems to have only done edits of various numerical values.

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I understand your concern regarding spamming on Wikipedia and I support it, but I believe all of the links I added were carefully placed in context to enhance your current entries with illustrations. They are not spam. In one case In the New York Public Library's website, I added the link as a reference to an artist who is internationally recognized as one of the earliest caricaturists so that the entry would be more accurate. In the entries of Jean Ignace Isidore GÃ©rard and Charles Philipon I added links to illustrations because there were no visual examples of their work.</p>
<p>GreatCaricatures.com is a not-for-profit reference site and I added these links after seeing that another author had already linked to my site from the James Gillray entry. I'm glad your users have found the Great Caricature site to be of use and I think the works on the site can be useful for many of your entries.</p>
<p>Please review the links I entered and let me know if they're really inappropriate for your portal.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>David Donihue donihue@greatcaricatures.com</p>

<dd>Hello David, thank you for replying to my concerns. First, I do not speak for Wikipedia, I'm just one person who edits here. But I hope you can understand my reaction. It is not uncommon to see a systematic linking within related pages here, with the general intention of increasing hits/revenue of the linked commercial site.I agree that your links were placed within appropriate pages, and the illustrations are brilliant. Personally I would love to see them included in some manner. However, I'm not sure what the best approach would be.Don't worry about me marking you edits, and haunting your every move (!), but I think that over time many .com links are removed as a matter of course by other editors. Another possibility is to place the images themselves directly in the article. This of course would require some deliberation on your part as there are copyright issues. (See GFDL).In any case, I hope I didn't scare you away from Wikipedia. Feel free to contact me again if you want to discuss this further. Cheers.

<dd><i>Hi Calton. Well, the issue wasn't the edits. My notes made it pretty clear that the problem was a large edit without any discussion or edit summaries.

<dd><i>My notes made it pretty clear that the problem was a large edit without any discussion or edit summaries.</i> And that would be PedanticallySpeaking's unilateral addition of images (<b>29</b> images) and dozens of minor events and births, not to mention his unilateral (and disputed) addition of numerous subheadings to break up his bloat. Since 131.107.0.73 was to some degree trying to restore the status quo, then yes, I stand by my statement that you got it backwards when you reverted him. I've done further restoration, and will go after the more obviously ridiculous of the new entries when I get the chance (such as <i>1998 - <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>: The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> votes 390-0 to express the sense of the House that it is a national priority to provide affordable housing for all</i> This is a notable event?

<dd><i>First, I should apologize for the tone of my inital reply... no need for me to be so short.&#160;:) I'm not going to argue with you about the content of July 20 (although at least PedanticallySpeaking said what s/he was doing) - I only came across this on RC Patrol. 131.107.0.73 had made over 250 edits in the span of 6 hours without a single comment. The edits to July 20, if made all at one time would have flagged anyone using CryotpDerk's VF, and when I looked at a sample of the edits I saw a complexity that worried me. That was why I tried to engage the editor with my first comment to the User talk:131.107.0.73 page, and then followed it up 15 minutes later with the revert. Was I wrong? That's entirely possible, and I'll try to be careful, but we all have different levels of trust I guess. Cheers.--Bookandcoffee(Leave msg.) 02:55, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</i>

<dd>If you've been doing RC Patrol, you might have noticed that 131.107.0.73 has been doing this for MONTHS now (Kate's Tool says 1437 edits), and going by your <i>we all have different levels of trust I guess</i>, it means that for you, "large edits by anon IPs: bad!" and "large edits by named editors: okay!" with no further examination necessary, even after I had <b>provided you with a diff to show you what the latter was doing</b> before you came up with the "large edits are a problem" rationale.

<p>Good evening. I noticed that you reverted some vandalism by anon user:156.63.181.3 today. I also noticed that you marked his/her user page with a variation of the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} template. This particular user is under an active Vandalism Watch and has been repeatedly blocked for vandalism. I applaud your attempt to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> by marking the warning so lightly but, in this case, I think the trust was misplaced. The pattern of edits does not suggest that this is an open proxy with lots of different users.</p>
<p>Could I ask you to join in the vandalism watch by periodically reviewing this user's edits and noting your conclusions on the Talk page? I've created a placeholder on the page where trusted users can record their findings when reviewing parts of the contribution history.</p>
<p>Could I also ask you to consider the other warnings on the page when applying one of the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest-n_7724.html" title="Template:Test-n">test-n</a>}} templates? If the last warning was fairly recent, we should probably be escalating the warning, not restarting.</p>

<dd><i>Hi Rossami. Sure, I'll try to check the contribs from this anon from time to time. You're right, I should have looked a little harder at the previous test warnings.

<p>Your proposal looks great, and I think this is an important project as Wikipedia's coverage of labour issues is currently very weak.

<p>We are having problems with the St. John's University article. A user keeps adding ridiculous material to it. Every time someone tries to change it, this person reverts it back. I cannot keep reverting it due to the 3 revert rule. Since you are apparently part of the Counter Vandalism Unit I would appreciate your help on this.</p>

Hi Bobbydoop, you seem to be encountering quite a bit of resistance when trying to insert "lack of engineering, lack of medical programs," in the St. John's University, New York article. Please remember that continuously reverting changes to your statement ([1] [2] [3] [4]) is a violation of Wikipedia:Three-revert rule.--Bookandcoffee 01:26, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response i'm running into a back and forth issue with Tfine80 who will not go into discussion <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 03:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tfine80 is giving a lot of trouble to me on various pages. He refuses to go to talk pages and discuss things. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 03:11, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I'm only going to give one piece of advice here Bobbydoop, and you can listen or not, I doubt I'll be back. I looked at this a little, and both you and Tfine80 are battling it out with multiple reverts (Tfine80 - 7 reverts, you - 6 as of 19:18, 28 December 2005). Leave it alone, and let the other thousands of editors here, who are not personally invested, sort out what is what. Go do something with the other 887,855 articles here. Easier said than done, I know, but there it is. Cheers.--Bookandcoffee 03:42, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee. In water-short Australia, all water infrastructure tends to be quite notable and are often quite popular tourist attractions. In the scheme of things, Clarendon Weir is large/important enough for an article - but others mightn't think so. I've made a note to try and expand on it sometime soon. As an aside, thank you for your refreshing approach to AfD - so few actually check around before sprinting to deletion.

<dd>Moreover, I just noticed you were setting up a WikiProject on organised labour. If you get it up, let me know and I'll consider participating. I'm quite interested in the labour movement (well, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_labour_movement.html" title="Australian labour movement">Australian labour movement</a> anyhow), and have noticed a deficiency in such articles whilst researching the so-called <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_industrial_relations_legislation%2C_2005.html" title="Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005"><i>"WorkChoices"</i></a> rÃ©gime soon to be established here.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 09:11, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
