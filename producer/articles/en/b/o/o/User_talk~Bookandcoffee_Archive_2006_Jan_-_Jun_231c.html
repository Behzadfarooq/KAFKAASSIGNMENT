<p>I moved the entire <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion_jewelery.html" title="Fashion jewelery">fashion jewelery</a> wiki to its correct spelling (<a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion_jewelry.html" title="Fashion jewelry">fashion jewelry</a>) and somewhat cleaned it up. Thanks to my inability to spell, it's currently tagged in the wrong place. What should be done now? I think my amateurwikiness got in the way. Jjjsixsix 00:02, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alrighty, awesome. Seriously, why can't they just spell Americanish? But Americanish+British/2 = Canadianish. Whatever. Anyhow, thanks for your help.

<p>How was the message I left him vandalism? I've inquired about his site multiple times but he just refuses to answer my questions! If he'd simply leave a public answer, I'd leave it at that.</p>
<p>I don't mean to seem rude, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to explain his works. If he thought they were bad, I'm sure he wouldn't have written them, nevermind posted them publicly online, in the first place. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.153.115.202 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.153.115.202.html" title="User talk:172.153.115.202">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.153.115.202_9b99.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.153.115.202">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Hello Bookandcoffee. This template is a little experiment of mine. I am putting it on every article (I write) that I think has potential for significant improvement- basically everything except a list. It has three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) to really encourage the uninitiated and unaware to jump in and contribute- right when they are reading</li>
<li>2) to tell them about the talk page- most have no idea what it's for</li>
<li>3) to sub-consciously advise the potential vandal that there are others paying attention to the article</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think people realize the potential of this medium for an intelligent discussion about the content of the article and a gentle but constant reminder in a prominent place seems like a way to build such a culture. Maybe I should put something on the talk page as well?? Needless to say, I have been noodling with the wording, so would welcome any thoughts on how to best achieve these goals.</p>
<p>I like your comment box and am going to steal it if it puts the comment on the talk page like I expect.</p>

<p>Thanks for the welcome. That was fast. I guess it's nice to know that someone is watching these pages. Looks as though you're a member of the counter-vandalism unit, so that must be why.. Feel free to pass on any formatting suggestions, as this was the first page I've created (as you probably saw flagged!) Chris</p>

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee. Sorry I haven't responded to your message before. I haven't had a lot of time for editing of late. I saw the new version of the intro to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">Trade union</a>, but thought I would leave it for others to comment as I'd been involved in the drafting. It looks good - much better than the old version. Glad it's up now. I think it works well. Glad you could use the stuff I put up for it. By the way - good work on Labour Wikiproject. Sorry I can't contribute more at the moment. I'm hoping to do some useful work at some point soon though, including an overhaul of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Dock_Strike_of_1889_6a5e.html" title="London Dock Strike of 1889">London Dock Strike of 1889</a>, perhaps to the point where it could try for FA status. Don't know if there are any labour featured articles yet, but it would be great to have some soon.

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee. I think the category idea is a good one, especially as there are already some populated categories for a few industries. The problem with integrating the list by industry is that the "categories" I was using were just ones that occurred to me as I went along and wouldn't necessarily be a useful way of classifying organisations. I've been trying to think of where we might find an existing classification scheme that we could use as a template. One possibility is the scheme used by the Historical Dictionary of British Trade Unionism which breaks down organisations by sector and then by work-group organised. This wouldn't be very up to date - but it might reflect the connections between organisations/groups and lines of demarcation more accurately than a scheme designed by economists, which would probably be the other potential source for a classification scheme. One of the difficulties I have with this is that because of my labour history background I tend to think about all this in terms of past organisations rather than the present. I still think the Historical Dictionary could be a useful template though, and will go and have a look at as soon as I get a chance. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattley_ace2.html" title="User talk:Mattley"><sup>(Chattley)</sup></a> 18:30, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee - lovely to talk to a Canadian. I appreciate your courtesy in responding to my redlink removals on <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_and_employment_law.html" title="Labour and employment law">Labour and employment law</a> My intentions were good as you note. I have three points and would appreciate your reply before I return to the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <a href="../../../o/n/l/Wikipedia%7EOnly_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context_c7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context</a> states very clearly <i><b>What should not be linked ....</b> Subsidiary topics that result in redlinks unless the editor is prepared to promptly turn those links into real ones .... It's usually better to resist linking these items until you get around to writing an article on each one.</i></li>
<li>2. The article has a <b>In need of attention</b> tag - one of the many things that needs attention is the redlinks.</li>
<li>3. The adjustment I made to what you have reverted to on this redlink</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_labour_and_employment_law.html" title="Canadian labour and employment law">Canadian labour and employment law</a></i></div>
doesn't get you to the main article - but the one that I adjusted it to being <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main.html" title="Main">Canadian labour and employment law</a> does so I miss the point - I would suggest that you have the bracket style incorrect perhaps?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I understand your point that <i>In many cases redlinks can be an important tool for letting people know there is information that is still needed</i> but only if you or others are prepared to <b>promptly</b> write that page. The fact is that an article looks and feels clumsy when it is full of redlinks. The better way to seek that sort of new article assistance is probably to put a request for article pages in the discussion page. Get back to me (my field is Industrial and Employment Law) as I want to help but if you revert from wiki policy and methods it is a bit difficult. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 22:49, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> that's very constructive. Appreciate your point on Main - which escaped me and is my fault entirely. As you noted my intentions were good - I was just trying to remove the redlink/s which you have my views on and thought it was just the brackets for this one item. Anyway it has opened up pandoras box on the issue of redlinks and that is probably about time. Perhaps we might get a policy very soon.

That way they can be vetted to check that there are a viable number of stubs (a minimum of 50-60 stubs), that the categories does not cross the existing stub hierarchy before the stub is created, and that the templates and categories are unambiguous and follow the naming guidelines for stub types.</s></p>
<p><s>In the case of these stub types, several of them are below the threshold number of stubs required for new stub types - even with the existence of a WikiProject dedicated to them. In this case, there is a Wikiproject for Labour organizations in general, but there are not separate projects for different countries or regions, so several of the categories may well be upmerged. More importantly, as far as naming is concerned, stub types are deliberately named to avoid words which have different spellings on the two sides of the Atlantic, and also words which have multiple meanings (such as "union"). This is the reason there is no "Unionist-stub" (instead there's "worker-activist-stub"). For this reason, all nine stub types have been proposed for renaming at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>.</s></p>
<p><s>Though some categories for unions and other workers' organizations are undoubtedly worthwhile, you could have saved yourself and WikiProject Stub sorting both effort and time if you had followed the guidelines by proposing the stub types first!</s> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 14:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Skip that. I see there <i>was</i> a proposal - sorry! However the proposal did mention to avoid "labor" and suggested the term "worker-org-stub" instead (coincidentally but hardly surporisingly this is the proposal for the renaming). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 14:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Chris - that's a very good description of what the stub-sorting project's like! Yeah, I'm too quick to anger on this too, so sorry if I came across too heavy.

<p>No, by all means do if you think it is better.

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee,</p>
<p>I just got your message and would be happy to continue to update the list of <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-CIO_f5ff.html" title="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> members. I'm a member of both Actors' Equity and AGMA, and I noticed that there was no mention of AGMA at all, so I decided to change that. I'll probably start work on an article for AGMA, but I don't have large chunks of time to devote to this kind of thing, so it'll be done in stages, I think. If you have any suggestions, let me know.</p>

<p>Sorry about the slow response. My sense is you'll have to still do a conventional request at CFD and let the nomination do the standard slow wander down the page to the bottom before someone feeds the requisite changes to one of the bots and gets the various edits made. Irritating, I know, and there's the frustrating possibility of a luck-of-the-draw thing meaning total randoms will vote you down because it doesn't synch up nicely with their own 3-second assessment. Blatant and repeated assurances that this is in accordance with a consensus reached elsewhere (with linking) ought to keep that at a minimum. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Tom_5b57.html" title="User:The Tom">The Tom</a> 23:08, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well... I can't 'document' the deal made between King and Gettelfinger but too many facts from too many sources add up.</p>
<p>I understand what you're saying about POV and my comment on the 'one party state' but that is documentable. The UAW has what it calls a Public Review Board, an outside body that acts as the highest appeals body for internal judicial (union constitution) matters. The PRB (in upholding a decision of the 'International' Executive Board [Int'l in that there are one or two locals in Ontario that didn't join CAW, or Int'l in some kind of US arrogance] actually called the UAW a one party state.</p>
<p>Now we're down to it aren't we? Beyond my experimentation with what works on wikipedia and to the question of whether I will find the time to take it seriously enough to add to the articles I am knowledgable about.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for responding. It's a fascinating medium.</p>

I would like to list. http:// www.unionnmillwright.com "Millwrights The Trade of all Trades" http:// www.unionnmillwright.com/history.html "Millwright History" http:// www.unionnmillwright.com/ "Who are the Millwright?"</p>
<p>In several categories.....</p>
<p>Unions... Trades... Guilds... Occupations Apprenticeships... Metal working... Mills...</p>
<p>And others that you think would be correct? Thank You Ron Oliver Millwright</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thank you for your message. I have been a Union Member for 35 years (ubc). My Bride (35 years) and I live in North Idaho (95 miles from B.C.) in Saint Maries.

<p>Hello Chris:</p>
<pre>
Thanks for the preaching..Ha-Ha I needed it. I can see that my approach was in la la land. KISS ---- "Keep It Simple Stupid" ---- Does not work all of the time. I will keep in mind your words of wisdom.

<p>I'm going to move my comment back shortly, but I wanted to stop by and let you say more on the subject if you wished. I understand that you don't want to get involved, but moving my comment <i>is</i> getting involved. It's also why I was hoping you wouldn't engage with the sock. When you move my comments, you allow him to say "See! I told you IronDuke was being unreasonable! Even other editors are removing his comments!" I really want to avoid this. You need not respond to him or me, but if my comments are not acceptable, please let an admin make that call (and there are admins aware of the situation as we speak). Fair enough? <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 22:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey -- so I see you stopped editing for a while. I am going to replace my comments. <i>Please</i>, for the sake of my sanity (and for your own) do not remove them again. I'm having a tough enough time dealing with the wikistalking as it is without other editors piling on. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 03:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Didn't mean to be piling on... I know moving another editor's comments is a risky thing at the best of times. I'll still be around, but hopefully the actual article is fairly stable for the time being. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 10:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that you point out the specifics, it does seem a bit biased. So by all means, go ahead with your edits. You really didn't have to come to me, but I do appreciate the gesture.
