	    <p>I'm not sure if you realied it, but when you tried to correct the capitalization of Official songs of memphis, you only moved the talk page, but moved it to the article space, leaving the actual article at the old location. I've undone the move and moved both pages to Official songs of Memphis, Tennessee. Per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#General_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia naming conventions</a>, 'the' is unnecessary, and 'songs' should be lowercase. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 14:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's different from verifying whether or not Saks's songs are official songs of Memphis because Jersyko is not seeking to add his credentials to a Wikipedia article. Even if he were lying about being a lawyer (which I sincerely doubt) it would have had nothing whatsoever to do with the discussion. Jersyko's reaction was actually quite understandable, as in the past editors have been harassed in real life by other editors because of disputes on Wikipedia. Because of those events, Wikipedia takes threats like Reneec's very seriously. Reneec had been cautioned repeatedly against making personal attacks, and had been warned of the potential consequences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reneec has had two admins review and deny the request for unblocking, and has been given the opportunity to discuss the block with the blocking administrator and responded with another personal attack. What happens next, so far as I can tell, is between Reneec and the admin to made the block. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 02:26, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">userspace</a> is given far more leniancy than Wikipedia articles: because userpages are not encyclopedia articles, users are not required to furnish citations for personal or biographical information displayed there if they choose not to, and readers in turn are free to take said information with a grain of salt if they see fit. They are not free to threaten to contact liscencing authorities because they doubt the claims made by editors on their user pages; at least, not if they wish to continue to edit Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Reneec's suggestion that s/he intended to contact the Bar Association regarding Jersyko was inappropriate for reasons already outlined to you by me and other editors. Under Wikipedia policy, the comment was a legal threat, and a blockable offense. You may disagree with that policy, but arguing the point with me is not going to change it. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 03:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Boodro, Vary doesn't get it. Reneec was suggesting, trying to present and urge reasons in opposition, that perhaps the bar should be consulted in the same manner as user Jersyko and Scribner bombarded the city council, mayors office and newspapers with phone calls about Mr. Saks. Reneec never intended to contact the <i>liscencing authorities</i> (haha), University of Memphis or the bar. She simply introduced and inserted in a subtle manner (although she knows who Jersyko is and never revealed his identity in the forum) (as I've promised her to not reveal), a suggestion that perhaps someone should question the validity of Jersyko's identity as he challenged Mr. Saks' in the discussion, in addition to the accusation that user Scribner made that Reneec was Mr. Saks. Reneec sent me an email and said that Mr. Saks was contacted by the Memphis City Council, the Mayors office, the Commercial Appeal, and that the Commercial Appeal wanted to know who these "screwballs" are that were trying to find out about him because they wouldn't identify themselves, and even became indignant and hung up on the attendant reporters. Doesn't surprise me. It's amazing how these things germinate. Apparently, Mr. Saks has a friend who works at the 'Metro Desk' for the newspaper who called him to warn him that there were some "nutcases" trying to find out whether or not he was a composer. Jersyko became intimidated and demonstrates his paranoia on <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> talk page. This has been an attempt arising from intense ill will or hatred to discredit and censure the notablity of these works, as so often occurs throughout Wikipedia. Vary's lack of success to substantiate her reason in this matter further exhibits an irritating and ridiculous attempt to purge the issue in the substance of favoritism shown to friends and associate editors without regard for their qualification to delete the article based on fact. It clearly demonstrates that this user has a personal issue with the inclusion of the item, even though it's been demonstrated far beyond any logical statement that is assumed to be true, and from which a conclusion can be drawn, that the Official Songs of Memphis are real and notable. A declaration has been made emphatically, clearly providing evidence necessitating the inclusion of this modest piece of information regarding Mr. Saks and his honor . Also, in the tag for suspicion for <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoodro_8931.html" title="User:Boodro">Boodro</a>, an IP whois check will demonstrate that you're in a different part of the world from user <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7EReneec_9c3d.html" title="User:Reneec">Reneec</a>. This is another immature attempt by the same opposing users to charge falsely, attempt to have banned, and, with malicious intent, attack the good name and reputation of someone who has contributed a civil, verifiable entry in support of this matter. I hope you read this, <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoodro_8931.html" title="User:Boodro">Boodro</a>, before it's rebuked, found blameworthy, censured and deleted by the same people. I appreciate a new user as yourself and hope you won't find the vaporings of these malevolents discouraging. Don't let them deprive you of confidence or hope or enthusiasm and, hence, deter you from believing that you possess the truth. 66.239.212.59 05:45, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
