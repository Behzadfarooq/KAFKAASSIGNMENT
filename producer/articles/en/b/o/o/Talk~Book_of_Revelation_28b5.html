<p>Hallo, I do not want to war over such a trifle, but the picture does not show "John of Patmos" but merely Saint John, by which the painter understood John the Evangelist, <b>on</b> Patmos. This confirmed by the picture description at Commons: "Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry, Saint John on Patmos the Musée Condé, Chantilly." <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 06:06, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is, we have <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Apostle_1f74.html" title="John the Apostle">John the Apostle</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Evangelist_a628.html" title="John the Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Patmos_3859.html" title="John of Patmos">John of Patmos</a>. Most medieval and Renaissance Christian artists identified these three individuals as the same person (and most traditional or conservative Christians today probably still do). However, we have 3 different articles on wikipedia. While the artist may have thought that the Evangelist was the one on Patmos described in Revelation, I feel that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Patmos_3859.html" title="John of Patmos">John of Patmos</a> is the most appropriate wikilink because the painting specifically references Patmos and imagery from the book of Revelation. However, a compromise would be to include a wikilink to both, saying "Visions of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Evangelist_a628.html" title="John the Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Patmos_3859.html" title="John of Patmos">John of Patmos</a>.."--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 12:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wouldn't it be better to have more than a few lines on the content of the book, before diving into the subtleties of its authorship and interpretation? I don't have that much experience with wikipedia, but it seems to me this article is far too specialized for an encyclopedic entry.</p>

Agreed. This needs to be addressed. --69.134.218.218 01:07, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not quite clear on the the problem. I think the couple paragraphs before the table of contents do a good job introducing the book. Authorship is the first section in the TOC but the intro is very well written as far as I can tell. If you believe differently what would you like to know?

<dd>No, it does not sound harsh. I cite all my sources, which are all primary, that is from authors from the antiquity. Sorry, I do not used tertiary sources (such as the opinions and interpretations of contemporary writers) and I will not apologize for that. Who am I? If you look at the parent site posted on top of the page, "Front page: Daniel &amp; Revelation" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html</a> , you will notice I provide my full name and a link to a short bio "about the author". Self-published? I can have somebody posting the link for me: as you can see from the parent site, I have some happy readers. The parent website I just mentioned shows ranked in 4th position on Google and 8th on Yahoo! for "Daniel and Revelation". Maybe I should propose the parent webpage, which is very short and proceed very quickly towards either Daniel or Revelation. Either that, or stating my name and posting the link to my bio on the 'Revelation' page. What do you think? (NEWS: ALL MY PAGES HAVE A LINK TO MY BIO AND EMAIL). BTW, thanks Andrew for saying you like my page. I want to tell you the links I proposed are well-researched, very thorough, contains no hate and would be an asset to Wikipedia. Try that short one: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html</a> Note: that site has been posted as a link, for a long time (please don't remove it!) on Wikipedia pages about 'historical Jesus', 'historicity of Jesus' and 'Jesus myth'. Under 'historical Jesus', the site is in 13th position on Google and 6th on Yahoo! Maybe I am not a registered scholar, but I thought Wikipedia was not all about propagating the work of professionals. I consider myself more of a critical &amp; investigative amateur historian, with burning (but not blinding) passion about the history of very early Christianity. And my approach (and background) should be commended in a field almost fully "owned" by scholars (most of them on a payroll) with very different opinions &amp; theories (which would prove that scholarly works, in this specific field, may be the problem, not the solution). I must admit I am very annoyed when my pages are rejected, mainly because some existing links are of bad quality, very biased or totally irrelevant (Check the last link on the 'Ignatius of Antioch' page --'Ignatius of Nerdtreehouse')(NEWS: I DELETED THE LINK). (BTW, I would love to attract your attention on these bad links, after reviewing them, of course). I did participate about one year ago into editing the 'Jesus' page. But that was very discouraging, with my work being often chopped down by evangelical Christians, even after some very long discussions.

<dd>Gah, I just lost all that I had typed up. Basically, I believe wikipedia should only be summarizing existing scholarship, not publishing original ideas. This is including in what cites we link to. You admit that you are only an amature who has a free website where you post your personal interpretations. This isn't the sort of thing that would pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> scrutiny. Yes, this is totally biased towards "registered scholars" and I feel thats a good thing. We are not a soap box for anyone with a free webpage to publish their thoughts. Wikipedia is about anyone having the ability to <i>edit</i>, not the ability to publish original research. There is a BIG difference between the two. As for hit counts, I believe your reasoning is circular. The only reason your site is ranked high is because wikipedia links to the historical Jesus page. Anyway, these are just my thoughts. I would suggest posting a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> if you want more editors imput. -<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 02:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, Andrew. I feel sorry that Wikipedia would sponsor the old guard of well-financed scholars. I am not even trying to change anything on the main text of these "religious" pages, certainly not attempting to publish my thoughts in front, just to propose, through a link, some well-evidenced thesis offering in the process some refreshingly clear-cut solutions. And I got feedback as such:</dd>
<dd>"Your web page is very informative! The reading of Revelation without the Christian additions is suddenly very clear. My dad and I are very excited by your research"</dd>
<dd>"Daniel and Revelation: Really enjoyed reading your material. ... Thank you again, for the clear scholarly presentation. So many times I truthfully have no idea what the authors are attempting to say. My humbly opinion being "they" use words that they themselves understand to be quoted as if.... From the tower or perhaps from God or at least a demigod.... The goal of educating not only clergy but all who may seek wisdom. ... You are accomplishing on your Internet pages."</dd>
<dd>"I think ALSO that you have the makings of a scholarly site"</dd>
<dd>"Your intellectual honesty is striking. A quality that is rare nowadays. Most of the time writers have a conclusion in mind and argue their way to lead the reader to see things the way they do."</dd>
<dd>"Just wanted to thank you for your work. I've been trying to make sense of Revelation for years and never did know where to start. You have single handedly cleared it up for me. Fascinating research."</dd>
<dd>Amateurs are the ones who do not try to make a living through their research, and therefore, for the honest ones, not biased and very open to all of the primary evidence, wherever it leads. Please note that my two main entry pages <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html</a> were very popular on Google and Yahoo! before one of them (the first one) was posted as a link on three Wikipedia pages. So there is no circular reasoning here. Now, almost 80% of the "clicks" for my page on 'Revelation' (my most popular page these days) come from Yahoo! If you search there for just 'Revelation', my page shows in 6th position (and I am not even posted on Wikipedia!). So I think the whole thing is very unfair. <a href="../../../m/u/l/User%7EMullerb_f380.html" title="User:Mullerb">Mullerb</a> 04:03, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I made the following addition in front of my page, just to show the ideas I exposed in it are not without scholarly backing:</dd>
<dd>From JewishEncyclopedia.com - REVELATION (BOOK OF), Article by Crawford Howell Toy (Christian scholar, D.D., LL.D.) and Kaufmann Kohler (Ph.D.):</dd>
<dd>"The last book in the New Testament canon, yet in fact one of the oldest; probably the only Judæo-Christian work which has survived the Paulinian transformation of the Church. The introductory verse betrays the complicated character of the whole work. It presents the book as a "Revelation which God gave . . . to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass," and at the same time as a revelation of Jesus Christ to "his servant John." According to recent investigations, the latter part was interpolated by the compiler, who worked the two sections of the book—the main apocalypse (ch. iv.-xxi. 6) and the letters to the "seven churches" (i.-iii. and close of xxii.)—into one so as to make the whole appear as emanating from John, the seer of the isle of Patmos in Asia Minor (see i. 9, xxii. 8), known otherwise as John the Presbyter. The anti-Paulinian character of the letters to the seven churches and the anti-Roman character of the apocalyptic section have been a source of great embarrassment, especially to Protestant theologians, ever since the days of Luther; but the apocalypse has become especially important to Jewish students since it has been discovered by Vischer (see bibliography) that the main apocalypse actually belongs to Jewish apocalyptic literature."</dd>
<dd>In general agreement with the above, next, I will provide a short synopsis, with some remarks (mostly about authorship), before proceeding to the ancient text, where, with inserted comments, points previously postulated will make a lot of sense (I hope you'll agree, as some of my previous readers: see here)."

<p>I do not know how Yahoo! works, but right after I indicated here that two of my sites were showing high on the Yahoo!'s lists (when searching for 'Revelation' and 'Historical Jesus'), my webpages suddenly disappeared.

<p>Can anyone tell me what are the official Wikipedia criteria for linked webpages (I know the ones for articles). Very confused, more so after I reviewed the links for the Revelation article. Some of the most contentious:</p>
<p>Under: Online translations of the Book of Revelation:</p>
<p>Martin Luther: Against the Roman Papacy, an Institution of the Devil - March 1545 cf.Martin Luther the "Super-Pope" and de facto Infallibility by Dave Armstrong [2]&#160;;Luther's Works CD-ROM Edition; Pope Gregory I ( c.540-604 ). NOT ABOUT REVELATION, NO ONLINE TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Contemporary Marian visionary explicates in "A Time of Fire~A Way of Fire" that the Book of Revelation contains, in symbolic language encoded in the text, some of Jesus' most important teachings on personal and global transformation which were revealed only to his closest disciples. NOT EVEN A LINK</p>
<p>Many links are shown under the wrong headings (Online translations ...) when they are mostly commentaries only. Many sites represent original opinions by one person, most of the time not published (that is on paper, in a book). Some sites emanate ultra-religious sectarian viewpoints (one of them claiming the days of the Vatican are numbered). One link directs you towards the home page, and not towards the specific sub-page dealing (mostly) with Revelation.</p>
<p>Maybe I am upset that my webpage has been rejected, but I think Wikipedia is not helping itself in accepting links to dubious pages (most of them very well presented, I must admit). Soon this winter, I am going to work on this, but I am afraid, estimated at first look, and for obvious reasons which I will explained, about half or more of those links will be removed. But first, I want to know where to find the criteria of acceptability for specifically links. And I do not want to hear this one: this is not a link farm! Which means, through my past experience with Wikipedia: we have already too many links (mind you, the webpages already linked can be irrelevant, sectarian, with hate and stretched personal opinions/interpretations), so this proposed link, even if it is good, cannot be admitted.</p>

<dd>I think your criticisms of the existing links are great. Please, be bold and remove and reorganize the links as you wish. Speaking for myself, it's easy to monitor recent changes to a page if it is on my watchlist. However, it's hard to be held accountable for content that existed prior to me adding the page to my watch list. If you know of ways to improve the link section, then please, go right ahead!--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:50, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are right about some of the links. The criteria for external links can be found at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<p>The main reason for removal is that the point of this part of the article is to tell us <b>what</b> various faiths think about the BOR, not to explain <b>why</b> they think it. No other paragraph quotes supporting evidence from the texts of its faith so there is no reason for a special treatment for the LDS.</p>
<p>Slightly more cynically, I might point out that since the Book of Mormon was written in 1830, it is hardly astonishing that it "predicts" the existence of the BOR&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscar_Bravo_279f.html" title="User:Oscar Bravo">Oscar Bravo</a> 14:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>may be over the top. Can any church add "their view"? How about an unaffiliated church? We might have "1st Presbyterian Church of Detroit's View"?</p>
<p>I think we should have the major interpretations, and maybe link to others, or create a seperate page "Diverse Interpretations of Revelation" perhaps.</p>
<p>Does anyone agree?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>===Seventh Day Adventist view=== {{cleanup-section|February 2007}} {{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}} The [[Seventh Day Adventist]] have a historicist view. They don't try to interpret the Book of Revelation, but feel that it interprets itself. They believe that the 7 churches that are being written to are the spiritual history of the world, the seven seals as the political history of the world, and the seven plagues as the history of the military power, all from Jesus' time to the time of Jesus' second coming. They also believe the 12th chapter is referring to the history of Jesus being born to the time of 1260 years from 538 to 1798 when the Catholic Church persecuted people for reading and following the Bible. They see the 13th chapter representing the Catholic Church being the beast that comes out of the water or also from a place with a large amount of people, just as the Catholic Church was born out of the ruins of the Roman Empire. The second beast that is born is seen as representing the United States because it comes out of the desert or a place with little or no people. They believe that the seal of God and the mark of the beast has a lot to do with keeping the seventh day sabbath. The people that receive the mark of the beast push for laws that make people work on Saturday and keeping Sunday instead of Saturday, in accordance with their reading of the fourth commandment. People receive the seal of God when they deny the seventh day sabbath. They also believe in the millennium of the 1000 years of revelation 20. For the earth has had biblically 6000 years and they believe the earth will have its 7th millennium sabbath. Just as the Bible says to keep the seventh day sabbath. After this 1000 year sabbath, the saved people who were in heaven come back to earth to make the "New Jerusalem" on the mount of olives. They say that Jesus left from the mount of olives, and that he promised that the way he comes back is the way he left to heaven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>===The Jehovah's Witness view=== {{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}} Jehovah's Witnesses believe the Book of Revelation to be the inspired word of God. As a vision of the apostle John, Revelation employs symbolism and has great meaning for modern times, as well as the future. Witnesses believe some events in this book have already been fulfilled and others are still to be fulfilled. Revelation is viewed as providing an all-embracing vision of what God purposes for the mankind, and brings the grand theme of the Bible to a climax. The last book of the Bible closes out the record begun in the first. As Gen 1:1 described God's creation of the material heavens and earth, so Rev 21:1-4 describes a new heaven and a new earth and the blessings that will be brought to mankind, as prophesied also at Isaiah 65:17,18; 66:22; and 2 Pet 3:13. To Jehovah's Witnesses, the Book of Revelation is not a book of fear, but of wonderful future events.</p>
