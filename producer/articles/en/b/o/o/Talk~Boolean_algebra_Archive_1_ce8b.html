<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lattice?</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>(The following discussion occurred prior to Feb 25 2002)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Explain to me why the word "lattice" has to be mentioned in an article called "Boolean algebra" at all. For Chrissakes, Boole isn't even mentioned in the article! Sheesh! --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a>, who would have to go back to his books to set things right.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because that's what a Boolean algebra <i>is</i> - a kind of lattice. Which would be more important in a page on platypuses - to mention they were discovered by sir so-and-so, or to mention they are a type of monotreme? Not that we shouldn't have both, but we aren't normally that impatient.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, Boole himself probably wouldn't understand the article about Boolean algebra in its present form. And it omits all sorts of totally essential information to understanding what Boolean algebra is. Have a look at <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/01674.html" class="external text" title="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/01674.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and compare the article in its present form. I can have read Boole's formulation of Boolean algebra and understand it, without understanding our present BooleanAlgebra article. I think there's something wrong with that, particularly in an <i>encyclopedia</i> that attempts to <i>explain</i> concepts. This is, as always, MHO! --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Boole would definitely understand the article once he heard the definition of Lattice. The fact remains, however, that the abstract definition given here has much less intuitive flavor for somebody not interested in abstract mathematics than a more concrete definition. Of course, that is exactly the <i>point</i> of the abstract definition: it is not limited to a particular example.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most importantly, the ideas embodied in Boole's original algebra are far more limited than the abstract definition. It is important to make it clear that there are an infinite number of Boolean algebra's and that the one with just the elements 0 and 1 is only the simplest one. On the other hand, it helps beginners enormously if the simple and concrete case is explained a bit more fully.</p>
<p>So anyway, does my addition to the entry help make this clear?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Clear<i>er</i>, but not as clear as an encyclopedia article should be. The first paragraph or two should be introductory--something that someone who has had a basic course or two in logic&#160;;-) should be able to understand, anyway. I am a fan of making difficult concepts clear, which is what is needed in an encyclopedia (and which can be difficult to do, of course).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why not see other encyclopedia articles about B.A. online and see what they do? --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>

<p>It states: An ideal I of A is called maximal if I ≠ A and if the only ideal containing I is A itself. But doesn't A always contain A implying there are no maximal ideals? I'm new to this Wikipedia thing; should I just edit this? -- anon</p>
<p>If you know how to fix it, then yes, just edit it. In this case, somebody else has already done that.

<dd>I learnt Boolean algebra in high school, and lattices, mentions of logic and mathematical symbols never entered into it. It's not needed to understand what Boolean algebra/boolean logic is or how and where to use it. I have followed several mathematics-classes at university since then, and yes, I understand it all as it stands now, but there's still the fact that a majority of people on this planet haven't been to or even ever had the opportunity to follow university-level mathematics classes. If I knew where my high-school readers for this topic were I'd dig them out, but I don't. --<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaleissin_64fc.html" title="User:Kaleissin">Kaleissin</a> 13:57:45, 2005-08-22 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewrite attempt</span></h2>
<p>below is my attempt at rewriting stuff. my perspective is an electronic systems engineering student who also does quite a bit of computer programming in my spare time. feel free to comment and improve and hopefully we can pull something together that you can actually get you head arround without knowing about advanced mathematics.</p>
<p><b>Boolean algebra</b> normally reffers to an algebra system in which there are only two values true and false or 0 and 1. + is usually used for <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_OR_bffe.html" title="Logical OR">OR</a> and . or no symbol at all for for <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_AND_a22d.html" title="Logical AND">AND</a>. The use of theese operators is an analogy with addition and multiplication that holds if you consider any nonzero value to be the same as 1. Conventionally A.B+C is interpreted as (A.B)+C not A.(B+C). This is again the same as with addition and multiplication in normal algebra. <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_NOT_08f1.html" title="Logical NOT">NOT</a> is generally represented by overline. The basic identites given below can all be trivially proven by looking at every case from the truth table. There are other <b>boolean algebras</b> based on the normal boolean algebra but with more than two values however these are far less commonly used.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i>.<i>A</i> = <i>A</i></span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i> + <i>A</i> = <i>A</i></span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i> + 0 = <i>A</i></span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i> + 1 = 1</span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i>.0 = 0</span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>A</i>.1 = 1</span></li>
<li><img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/b/d/7bdfb57c1b95062841c34f79bd36ef3c.png" alt="\overline\overline{A}=A" /></li>
<li><img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/c/e/fce7989675aada228787748ebe88f154.png" alt="A.B=\overline{\overline{A}+\overline{B}}" /></li>

</ul>
<p>The + and . operators are distributive that is A.(B+C) = A.B + B.B and A+B.C = (A+B).(A+C) . The first of theese is the same as with normal algebra but the second is not! Consequentyly the first is far more comfortable for most people to do than the second. For this and other reasons a sum of products (which leads to easy NAND synthsis) is more commonly used than a product of sums (which leads to easy NOR synthisys.</p>
<p><a name="De_morgans_theorem" id="De_morgans_theorem"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">De morgans theorem</span></h3>
<p>De-morgans theorem states that if you invert every varible in a function swap + and . operators and invert the result you get a function equivilent to the one you started with. Repeated application of De-morgans theorem to parts of a function can be used to move all inversions to the individual variables.</p>

<dd>That's not what a Boolean algebra is. It is not true that there are "only two values" in a Boolean algebra. There is exactly one Boolean algebra with two elements (up to isomorphism), but there are an unlimited number of Boolean algebras with more elements. Some of what is said above to be provable is usually taken as axiomatic for a BA. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 03:31, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the stuff i listed can be proven by complete enumaration (e.g. evaluation for both A and B). Can you explain what the other boolean algebras are and how they relate to the normal two value case without needing university level maths? <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 13:20, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well i've bitten the bullet. As noone has taken the time to rewrite the more general case in a way that is understandable without university level math knowlage, I have described the normal boolean algebra first and moved the incomprehensible math to a section towards the end. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 20:42, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I object to this, strongly. There's no such thing as a "the normal Boolean algebra", and a BA is not defined in terms of truth and falsity, etc. What is there now is simply wrong. What was there before may have needed improvement, but it was put there by people who actually know what a Boolean algebra is. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 22:49, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry i had to do it this way but it was quite obvious that noone who understood the existing article (i freely admit that i can't make sense of it myself) was going to make it accessible to those without a university education in maths so the only option left was to rewrite based on what i had been taught boolean algebra was. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 23:01, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Josh. I think we should revert to the original article then discuss what can be done to make the article more accessible. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 23:56, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've decided to go ahead and revert this for now while we discuss what to do. Plugwash what you are trying to write about is what the article calls the "two element Boolean algebra" (see the first example). Perhaps what you want to do is write an article just about that example? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 05:02, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The existing article is so jargon infested that i can't make sense of it myself. Therefore i can't help to make the existing content more accessible. If you can do so fine but if not then i'm going to re-revert you. Just what are theese other boolean algebras actually used for anyway? <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 11:51, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't do that. As Paul and I have said, what was there was based on fundamental misconceptions about the meaning of "Boolean algebra". And the "other Boolean algebras" that you keep referring to are not obscure things. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about BAs is not the trival two-valued one but the one formed by the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. Arguably, all the interesting stuff happens in such infinite BAs. This article is not about two-valued "Boolean logic" in the context of digital electronics or Google searches. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 12:54, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately not all of mathematics can be made easily accessible, to people who lack a certain background. The article as written is correct, if perhaps somewhat difficult to understand. The article as you edited it was more accessible perhaps, but not entirely correct. For now I think the former is better. We can work on making this article more accessible, perhaps by incorporating some of you edits. But what about my suggestion about writing a different article just about the two-element Boolean algebra? As for what are these "other" Boolean algebras "used for", they are used in the study of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_logic.html" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_theory.html" title="Information theory">information theory</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probability.html" title="Probability">probability</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_algebra.html" title="Universal algebra">universal algebra</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_theory.html" title="Order theory">order theory</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a> among other things, and they are also studied in there own right.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A modest proposal</span></h2>
<p>My impression, from looking at the article and the discussion here, is that the mathematical approach taken in this article is confusing the large, nonmathematical audience who are only interested in the applications of this <i>one</i> algebraic structure, and who know little or nothing about abstract algebra in general. Thus, my suggestion for an quick improvement would be to <b>move the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html#Examples" title="Boolean algebra">examples</a> section up</b>. It's clean, well written, and provides much of what the nonmathematical audience wants from this article. The mathematical treatment can then continue in later sections.</p>
<p>Specifically, I suggest that the <i>Definition and first consequences</i> section be split up, with only the axioms in the first half, and the <i>Examples</i> section be placed between them. The lead section could also be made shorter, with references to new sections named <i>History</i> and <i>Notation</i>. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> 15:15:53, 2005-08-31 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, if there's enough non-redundant content to be put there. It's probably <i>not</i> a good idea to shunt all the applied stuff there and leave a pure lattice-theoretic treatment here, since then nonmathematical readers wouldn't see the connection between the two. Even the general "Boolean algebra" article should be at least mostly understandable to the general public. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> 16:18:46, 2005-08-31 (UTC)

<dd>No I wouldn't remove any content from this article. And redundancy isn't really a bad thing. Since space isn't an issue and Wikipedia isn't designed to be read sequentially, some the issues that make redundancy bad in other contexts simply don't apply here. In fact on Wikipedia, judicious redundancy can actually be a good thing, since it makes us more robust, and able to recover more easily from mistakes, or vandalism. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 17:26, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been thinking for days how to improve this page...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that the fundamental disagreement unearthed by Plugwash stems from the ambiguity between <i>a</i> Boolean algebra, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_noun.html" title="Count noun">count noun</a>, which is a mathematical structure, and just plain Boolean algebra, undeclinable <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_noun.html" title="Mass noun">mass noun</a> construed as singular, which is a notation and rules for manipulating it. While the two notions have points of commonality, they are quite distinct, and I think it's a disservice to conflate them. For example the current article is primarily about the mathematical structure, yet it includes the following passage</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Specifically, Boolean algebra was an attempt to use algebraic techniques to deal with expressions in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which is about the other notion.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-element_Boolean_algebra_eb47.html" title="Two-element Boolean algebra">two-element Boolean algebra</a> article is sort of beside the point as an attempt to capture the mass-noun notion, because that notion is not really concerned with any particular structure, not even the two-element algebra; it's just a logical calculus.</p>
<p>So my proposal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current article be renamed Boolean algebra (mathematical structure)</li>
<li>Plugwash's article be renamed Boolean algebra (logical calculus)</li>
<li>A disambig page be placed under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> simpliciter.</li>

The study of Boolean algebras is not a "more complex" version of what you call "Boolean algebra"; it's another topic entirely (though certainly with connections). <i>A</i> Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure, like a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">group</a> or a <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Ring (mathematics)">ring</a>, and there's no reason its article should be less technical than those. <i>Except</i>, of course, to accomodate those who are looking for the other notion, the one called "Boolean algebra" as a mass noun.</dd>

<dd>I think of it as similar to the relationship between Newtonian physics and the more general rules of physics, including relativity. The Newtonian physics is a subset of the general physics, but is the far more often used version, for practical applications like figuring out how soon a train will arrive, since relativity doesn't need to be considered in most cases.

<dd>I agree with Travatore, that you are missing his point. This article is about a mathematical object called a "Boolean algebra". It is not about a theory, complex or basic. What you are thinking about is a different thing, and it shouldn't be called "Boolean algebra (basic concepts)".

<dd>So it's a good-looking article, written clearly, but it seems to be rather specifically about the algebra of subsets of a given set. I'm skeptical that that's what many people understand by "Boolean algebra"; I'd like to see it sourced. In the first two pages of Google hits, only two looked like they might have considered "Boolean algebra" to be that concept, and one of those probably not (it was a book; I was guessing a bit from the TOC).</dd>
<dd>The largest single group seemed to be about the 0-1 truth-table concept, together with algebraic manipulation of variables taking those values (these tended to be about electronic circuits). Another significant group talked about Boolean search terms. And of course there were a few that actually discussed Boolean algebras as algebraic structures. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 04:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll put in a voice for what is now the status quo, ie. this article stays where it is, and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> is what was <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">User:StuRat</a>'s article. Clearly the two articles overlap heavily, being about the paradigmatic theory of algebraic logic and its applications, but it is right that Boolean algebra should be concerned with the aspects of most interest to algebraists and Boolean logic to the aspects that are key to its use in logic and engineering applications. There's some tidying up of the divide to be done, but nothing urgent, and it should wait until whatever <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boole%27s_syllogistic.html" title="Boole's syllogistic">Boole's syllogistic</a> becomes. Two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>As observed by others <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> refers to the Boolean algebra under a restricted class of models, namely the set-valued models. There's some importance to this in philosophical logic that probably doesn't belong in the Boolean lagebra article, namely that Boolean logic is the logic of bivalence. OTOH it might be nice to connect this discussion with Stone duality, which does demand some algebra...</li>
<li>The algebra that George Boole extends Boolean rings and does not admit set-valued models. I don't know much about the models, but I 'm going to do a spot of research on them in the coming days.</li>

<dd>Can you explain why you're against the disambig? Personally I think it's necessary that the article currently called <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>, be named some variant of "Boolean algebra", because it seems to be what a lot of people are looking for under the name "Boolean algebra".

<dd>We do still have the problem of calling it [[Boolean algebra (<i>what</i>)]]. There was a suggestion that the current <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> be moved to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>, and that <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> become Boolean algebra (mathematical structure).

<dd>This topic, ie. what StuRat's article is about, is probably the most widely known system of logic there is, and I'm guessing far more people who are after this treatment will be thinking of "logic" than of "algebra". Already there is some treatment of logical aspects (when one starts talking about true and false, logic is not far away), and I think the article is an appropriate place for some more, particularly since non-set-valued models of Boolean algebra are generally somewhat exotic. I'm also against moving out the discussion of applications (or at least, moving out all of it), since the article is more well-rounded with it. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 16:37, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the set-valued models aren't logic at all; they're (baby) set theory. As far as the question of what people are thinking of, I think that's just not true; it seems that these topics are often taught as "Boolean algebra". "Boolean logic" in this meaning seems to be more or less a neologism. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:40, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hold on a moment. Boolean logic is the study of certain classes of sentence schemes, which we call formula, which have the property that they have a complete and particularly simple model theory, ie. maps from the set of formula to sets of finite sets. It's logic because the maps between formulae we are interested are a plausible representation of inference, and its algebra because all of the structures involved are nice and algebraically compelling. Set-valued models might not be logic, but that's because model theory is a part of logic. Boolean logic is a very widely used term; it is the main term used in electronics and programming for these structures, and phiosophers call this Boolean logic (more or less, the logic of truth tables, see eg., Barwise &amp; Etchemendy's <i>Language, Proof and Logic</i>). It is very far from being a neologism. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:20, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure model theory is part of logic proper. It's part of <i>mathematical</i> logic, but most of math logic isn't really logic; it's called "logic" for historical reasons. I'll take your word on the uses of the term "Boolean logic", but I still think the subject matter is taught to a lot of high schoolers as "Boolean algebra".</dd>
<dd>Anyway I don't have a lot personally invested in what StuRat's article is called, except that it needs to be made clear to people who come looking for it under the name "Boolean algebra", that the math-structure article is not about what they're looking for, nor is it even particularly about an extension or generalization of what they're looking for. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:46, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree about the problematic relationship between much of mathematical logic and logic proper, but Boolean logic is an exception: it's a place where a little bit for formalism and abstraction goes a long way even for not people without much mathematical culture. I agree on the need to signpost more clearly the articles. As I said above, when I'm done with the other Boolean article, I'll do a bit with these articles. I'm puzzled about the point about generalisation: doesn't Stone's theorem say that in the finite case Boolean algebras are the structures talked about in Boolean logic?

<dd>"In the finite case"? Really I don't see how there's anything in the topic treated by StuRat's article that's specifically about finite Boolean algebras. What I mean, I guess, is that the math-structure article on Boolean algebras should be seen first and foremost as something like the articles about groups or rings or lattices, rather than as about a generalization of the algebra of sets. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 19:32, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm talking about the representation theorem for BAs in terms of power set algebras: Tarski showed that in the finite case, every BA is represented by its power set, but in the infinite case that may fail, and the BA needs to be represented by a strict subalgebra. In the finite case, we're just talking about different ways of looking at the same thing, but in the infinite case (as we get in predicate logic), the algebraic view looks at things more finely than the power set view, as per Stone duality. The <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_of_sets.html" title="Field of sets">Field of sets</a> article seems to be the best intro. to the concepts around here, which are definitely hairy. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:30, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But for the <i>logic</i> part of it, the model--powerset of a finite or infinite set or something else--is irrelevant. If you want to formalize it, I suppose I mean the Π<sub>2</sub> positive theory--whatever falls just short of letting you express the claim "there are three distinct things", which is a concept that never comes up in the topic called "Boolean algebra" when you're not thinking about mathematical structures. Boolean algebras as mathematical structures are not to be seen as generalizations or extensions of <i>that</i> concept, but as another thing entirely--though it helps to know the non-structure concept to understand some reasons why the structure one might be interesting. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:32, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Synonym of "algebraic structure"? Can't really think of one. The definition could be substituted, but I doubt that would really help much. Or we could spin analogies, but I'm afraid that would be likely just to induce misconceptions. I doubt that it's practical in all cases to impose the understandability requirement you propose. Just <i>maybe</i>, for the specific case of Boolean algebras, one could get a tiny bit closer, but we have articles on <i>far</i> more technical topics.</dd>
<dd>I really think that the reason this keeps coming up for <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> is that people are coming here looking for a different topic taught under that name, one they expect to understand.

I <i>expect</i> to be able to read and understand the first paragraph of any Wikipedia article I come accross. Otherwise, Wikipedia fails to be a general-purpose and general readership encyclopedia. The reason for me coming here instead of either of those other topic areas is that, well, I got here first. I have little idea what booleen logic is either. Just because other articles are doing the same thing as this one doesn't mean that my argument is any less valid here. And I still have no idea what booleen logic is. And I'm sure that there are many others who feel the same. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">stianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 22:30, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have to realize that there <i>are</i> topics that are inherently too technical for you to understand, even in broad terms, after a mere brief description. Not just "you" you; it's true for everybody, though <i>which</i> topics it applies to will vary from person to person. In my opinion that does not justify banning these topics from WP.</dd>
<dd>Now, given half an hour in person, I'm pretty sure I could explain to you what a Boolean algebra is. An ∞-Borel set, probably not. But in either case I don't think that half-hour discussion should go at the top of the article.

<dd>That's where we disagree then. Take for example the derivative. I have no idea if you know anything of it (although you probably do) but I was asked as homework to find out about the derivative. Naturally, I came to the Wikipedia article. I couldn't make head nor tail of it. Then, next lesson our teacher took 5 minutes at the start explaining it and I got it very quickly. I have no doubt that this can be done with most topics. I don't want to learn the ins and outs, I just want to know what it is and what it does. That's not too much to ask from a first paragraph. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">stianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 22:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Reproducing your teacher's five-minute explanation, complete with wording capable of substituting for his/her hand gestures and interactive responses to your questions, would run pages and pages, not a paragraph.

<p>I think the first sentence is a good intuitive explanation for mathematicians. For non-mathematicians it is apparently gibberish. Let's not point to the existence of articles on other topics which are even more difficult/abstract and for which it would be likewise more difficult to write a non-math lead. This is not constructive. Also no-one is suggesting that such articles shouldn't exist, so let's not discuss that either. On the other hand it is not feasible to include the definitions of technical terms. What we need is an intuitive lead for non-mathematicians if at all possible. I think it exists and I hope we can work together to find it. Now back to Celestianpower's questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is "set-theoretic"?
<dl>
<dd>from set theory/to do with set theory.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What is a truth value?
<dl>
<dd>There are two truth values: "true" and "false". The values that a boolean variable can have in for example C++ or Java.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How do you abstract from a truth value?
<dl>
<dd>It means that you allow different values. "true" and "false" are usually represented by 1 and 0 respectively. You could allow for a third value or even the full interval [0, 1].</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How are intersection, union and complement related to eachother and/or booleen algebra?
<dl>
<dd>these are very similar to the logical notions of AND, OR and NOT.</dd>

Secondly, any programmer who has to manipulate exit conditions from a loop can understand what is being said here: some concrete condition raises a true/false flag and the point is to understand 'the rules of the game' for combining various conditions.

Simply trying to enforce the insertion of waffle and bluff doesn't make an encyclopedic article at all. Don't take an annoying and picky attitude towards those who have an interest in exposition. You actually do need someone who knows what the technical words mean, to write that meaning in any other terms. An introduction that isn't sound will just not last.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:14, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to make some progress on wording a way in to this article. So, someone, please give me an orthodox account of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_statement.html" title="Conditional statement">conditional statements</a> (which are quite general enough as examples of things on which to do Boolean algebra). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:34, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what you are asking here. I guess it must be worded too "rigorously" for me to understand. Are you trying to say you want some common if-then statements from real life&#160;? For example, "if it rains, then the street will get wet". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 22:37, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you could read the first sentence of that page: 'A conditional statement, in computer science, is a vital part of a programming language'. You're a programmer. I'll meet anyone half way on this. They have to be willing to meet me. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 06:26, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are willing to meet you half way. That consists of letting you have total control over the body of the article while we insist that the intro be readable by a general audience.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Got an edit conflict</span></h2>
<p>So Ksmrq was apparently working on the intro at the same time I was. His version's not bad, though I doubt StuRat's party will appreciate the ref to Heyting algebras and such, and it still claims that EE and CS use "Boolean algebra", which in context requires explanation.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me report my version here; maybe we can come to a synthesis. (I note that just by accident he chose the same example BA that I did--or maybe Pierce was right about "threeness"?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, a <b>Boolean algebra</b> (sometimes <b>Boolean lattice</b>) is a <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_structure.html" title="Algebraic structure">algebraic structure</a> (that is, a set of objects, called <i>elements</i>, together with <i>operations</i> on those elements, which take one or two elements and return another element). The elements can be thought of in various ways; one of the most common is to think of them as generalized <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_value.html" title="Truth value">truth values</a>. As a simple example, there might be three conditions that can be independently true or false. An element of the Boolean algebra might then specify exactly which ones are true; the Boolean algebra itself would be the collection of all eight possibilities, together with ways of combining them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A related subject that is sometimes referred to as Boolean algebra is <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>, which might be defined as what all Boolean algebras have in common. It consists of relationships among elements of a Boolean algebra that always hold, no matter which Boolean algebra one starts with. Since the algebra of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic_gate.html" title="Logic gate">logic gates</a> and some <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_circuit.html" title="Electrical circuit">electrical circuits</a> is formally the same, Boolean logic is studied in engineering and computer science, as well as in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_logic.html" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The operations on a Boolean algebra are referred to as <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_conjunction.html" title="Logical conjunction">AND</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_disjunction.html" title="Logical disjunction">OR</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_negation.html" title="Logical negation">NOT</a>. For the structure to be a Boolean algebra, these operations must behave as they would on the two-element Boolean algebra (the one whose only elements are TRUE and FALSE).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Boolean algebras are named after <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boole_832a.html" title="George Boole">George Boole</a>, an English mathematician at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Cork_4052.html" title="University College Cork">University College Cork</a>.</dd>

<dd>I much prefer your version to <a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq's</a>, which gets into way too much depth for an intro section. Note that I am not driving this move to simplify the intro, <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a> is, although I fully support the attempt. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So after thinking about it a bit, I've gone ahead and put mine in (obviously KSmrq's is still there; I don't object to a synthesis but couldn't really see how to do it without making it too long). This is not intended as a hostile move against KSmrq; as I said I thought his version was pretty good.</dd>
<dd>I think the most important <i>new</i> element in my version is the clear distinction between this article and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article (and I propose that we should use this as the primary test for the division between the two articles). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 04:38, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">new opening</span></h2>
<p>Hmm, is it a general rule that editors can't keep their hands off the opening sentences, but easily ignore the body? Anyway, previous editors said that previous openings were either incorrect or incomprehensible. I have tried to write a compromise version that I hope is neither.</p>
<p>The fact is, Boolean algebra is an important topic for a number of different parties and for different reasons. One of my seminal college courses, a combination of abstract algebra and computer science, used the text <i>Modern Applied Algebra</i> by Garrett Birkhoff (mathematician) and Thomas C. Bartee (engineer); Boolean algebra is introduced on page 3. It may be tempting for an electrical engineer to dismiss the mathematicians' concerns as excessive abstraction, but that text (written in 1970!) makes it clear that a broader treatment has practical benefits. Theoretical computer science depends on such material today even more than then.</p>
<p>Therefore I would like to request that everyone try to edit with consideration for all the different clients of this theory, and to especially defer to the mathematicians on the more abstract elements. Even if the utility is not immediately evident in one's present endeavors, it may well become essential for later work. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:46, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>KSmrq, please see my remarks above. I think it is important that in an article that defines <i>a</i> Boolean algebra, we not refer to the <i>subject</i> as "Boolean algebra"--that's just way too confusing; it would be like referring to group theory as "group". In my proposed intro in the above section I <i>mention</i> that usage, because so many people are expecting it, but explain what is the (current) WP solution for disambiguating. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:01, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The nesting of these replies is confusing. I'll just continue at my original level, responding to each of the points raised. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a>, that you balk at these three items puzzles me. Every time I use <i>any</i> notation — set or logical or order — I say it in English first. Poset is linked, and at worst could be spelled out as "partially ordered set"; but why is it worse than set or lattice? Heyting algebra is a parenthetical remark <i>telling</i> the reader what they're about, not assuming prior knowledge; but if you think it's too scary (I don't), it's expendable. I'm very much in favor of discussing mathematical topics in more accessible style <i>thoughout</i>, not just in the opening, so we're on the same page there. I am <i>not</i> in favor of dumbing them down to do so, which often means working <i>much</i> harder at the writing. Boolean algebras are defined and used and important in connection with these other topics; we must respect that.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a>, Do you mean I should have said "… Boolean algebras have many practical applications…"? If so, I agree; sorry 'bout that. I'll comment more on your new attempt below.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a>, right, "theory of free Boolean algebras" is not helpful wording to folks looking for the "other" Boolean algebra. I see no way an observation at this level of abstraction can help at the disambiguation level. (But in the body, it's a fine idea.)</li>
</ul>
<p>About the competing rewrite: Explicit mention of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> is helpful; explicit mention of the singular mass noun sense would also be helpful. Other than that, I can't say I'm a convert. It uses more words to say less, lacks the <i>concrete</i> examples I used, and lacks some of the links I added. One of the benefits of hypertext is that we can say "algebraic structure" without an inline definition; those who are unsure can follow the link. Obviously this can be abused, but I don't think I did so. Because I gave concrete examples, a reader can begin to get a feel for the subject even without following the link, seeing a visible parallel between the set theory and logic concepts, including the very similar notation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would help if I reproduce my list of mathematical education guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theorem(s), Proof(s), Intuition, Example(s), Counter-example(s), Connections</li>
<li>Exercises, Teaching</li>
<li>Pictures, Humor</li>
</ul>
<p>We can't cram all these into the opening, but I did include intuition, examples, connections, and pictures (in a sense, with the parallel notation). Elsewhere a suggestion was made to include a Hasse diagram (made easily with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphviz.html" title="Graphviz">Graphviz</a> and uploaded as <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a>), but the picture might require too much explanation this early on.</p>
<p>I will try one more time. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 12:01, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've spent a lot of time writing comments and then editing only to see my edits instantly obliterated, new image and all, and my views dismissed with bullshit. I'm tempted to say some very uncivil things about some very <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">uncivil</a> behavior. Obviously <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> and I have been working simultaneously, resulting in an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:edit_conflict" class="extiw" title="m:Help:edit_conflict">edit conflict</a> (very different from an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>). Neither of us is, I believe, intentionally trying to revert the other. But others are. I cannot respect and collaborate with those who act as if my view is worthless. Where I have tried to move forward, incorporating feedback, they can only revert back, ignoring it. To name names, I'm speaking of <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a>.

<dd>Your version, KSmrq, was (as far as non-mathematicians see it) patent nonsense and therefore was reverted. It seemed you had not read any of the discussion here and had gone back to a longer version of what I came to and was horrified to see. You didn;t make any attempt at simplification whatsoever. I would also like to add that my version was reverted very quickly also. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">stianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 14:42, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Since 4 people (3, if you don't count <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a>, who hadn't said so until after your first revert of Trovatore's work) preferred his version to yours, it was irresponsible for you to insist on reverting his edit and putting yours back in. That said, I see no reason why parts of your intro, such as the Hasse diagram, can't be moved down to the main body of the article, where the requirement to be accessible to a general audience is not as rigorously enforced. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 15:43, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really like this version. And the picture. What I dislike is the weak statement that a Boolean algebra captures essential properties. It is not restrictive. A Boolean algebra captures only those properties and nothing else.
