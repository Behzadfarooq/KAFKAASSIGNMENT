<p>This page could use a more balanced perspective on Washington. He was harshly criticized by educated blacks of his time period such as W.E.B. Du Bois. I edited the opening summary to touch on this issue but more work needs to be done. Ideally a section outlining common criticisms of Washington's politics. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.222.35.66_d386.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.222.35.66">71.222.35.66</a> (talk) 11:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The great majority of educated blacks supported Washington, as did DuBois at first. The attacks on BTW became serious long after his death. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 12:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That is absolutely not the case. Originally there was little open opposition to Washington because his political power made it a death sentence to oppose him. 134.10.176.178 06:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>134.10.176.178 is right (although "death sentence" is obviously hyperbole). DuBois <i>did</i> support Washington early, but he criticized Washington in <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> (1903). According to the <i>Africana</i> encyclopedia, the publication of <i>Souls</i> "allowed critics to be more open over the next few years." Africana also identifies the founding of the NAACP (1909) as "the greatest threat" to Washington's power.
<blockquote>
<p>"Washington tried at first to stifle the group; failing that, he sought a rapprochement. As that, too, failed, increasing numbers of [B]lacks gravitated to the NAACP, and Washington's base of power began to weaken."</p>
</blockquote>
That's hardly "long after his death."</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong. Washington was the most important African-American leader of his time, and his positive influence is underestimated by many of us who grew up after the ascendancy of DuBois and his philosophy. (If Washington is remembered at all, he often is mis-represented as an "Uncle Tom.") But a balanced account of Washington's life should include a fair discussion of his critics, together with an explanation of his views. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalik_Shabazz_a2fa.html" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a> 07:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just finished his fascinating autobiography, "Up From Slavery." There is much missing in the summary, but then, it is intended to be a summary. I recommend anyone who wants to know more about him read it. It is a rather quick and easy read, and besides, what better way to understand the man than to hear him tell his own story.</p>
<p>I would like to know how it was determined he was born April 5, 1856. The very first thing he writes in his book is, "I was born a slave on a plantation in Franklin County, Virginia. I am not quite sure of the exact place or exact date of my birth, but at any rate I suspect I must have been born somewhere and at some time. As nearly as I have been able to learn, I was born near a cross-roads post-office called Hale's Ford, and the year was 1858 or 1859. I do not know the month or the day."</p>
<p>I thought it would be important to note ALL his wives and children. His three wives were Fannie N. Smith, Olivia A. Davidson, and Margaret J. Murray. Fannie was from Malden, West Virginia, they married in the summer of 1882, they had Portia M., and Fannie passed away in May of 1884.</p>
<p>He married Olivia in 1885, they had Booker Taliaferro and Ernest Davidson, and she died in 1889. Olivia was born in Ohio, spent time teaching in Mississippi and Tennessee, and received her education at Hampton University and the Massachusetts State Normal School at Framingham. They met at Tuskegee when she came there to teach.</p>
<p>Margaret was from Mississippi, a graduate of Fisk University, and they married in 1893. Booker gives all three women enormous credit for their work at Tuskegee and is emphatic he would not have been successful without them. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.82.187.119 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.82.187.119_842d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.82.187.119">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I also would like to know about the birth date. It seems to me that if Booker T. Washington didn't know his own birth date, nobody else could have either. Does anyone know the specific source for this exact birth date?

<li>In "Up From Slavery," addressing how his date of birth was determined, if you look at the end of the sentence, there is a little 1 as a reference. The 1 says: Actually 1856, according to the best evidence available. Louis R. Harlan, <i>Booker T. Washington: The Making of a Black Leader</i>, 1856-1901 (New York, 1972),3.

<p>I have been researching and writing on <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Rogers_f354.html" title="Henry H. Rogers">Henry H. Rogers</a> and have contributed related content to this article. I feel that the article lacks needed information about how Dr. Washington progressed from his education at Hampton University to become a famous person. I also ran across some information about BTW's involvement with Giles Jackson of Richmond, who was apparently of a similar mindset that he could accomplish more net gain for black people by maintaining an openly cordial relationship with whites while working behind the scenes to fight discrimination and related problems. I lack the information to do a good job on improving this section of the BTW WP article, and I hope someone else will do so. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 01:31, Dec 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>this article tells nothing of what he actually did. I am a student trying to do a report for school and found this website. But really, it shouldn't be on the list! It shows nothing about his work or what he taught. It tells nothing of the schools that he founded and the people he worked with. I don't need to know about his privite life or anything that the article actually tells you other than his birth and death.

<p>It is my honest opinion that Booker was one of America's greatest black leaders to ever have been born.</p>
<p>He was not black. 216.229.196.116 14:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What was he? <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 02:37, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He was half-black. Thus mulatto. 70.144.194.187 03:14, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Most Blacks have some white blood. By your definition, virtually no African Americans would be considered Black! Booker T. Washington was definitely Black, with some white heritage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robert Russa Moton, head of Tuskegee University after Booker T. Washington's death, had two African Americans aviators do an air tour, and afterward the plane was christened the <i>Booker T. Washington</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentence is 100% confusing.</p>
<p>Was Moton Washington's immediate successor at Tuskeegee? The sentence seems to say so.</p>
<p>When and why did Moton have the airshow? Probably not in 1915, when Washington died and aviation was still in its infancy. Was it in 1956, on the 100th anniversary of Washington's birth? (That's just a guess.) Why not say so. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalik_Shabazz_a2fa.html" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a> 09:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>IMHO, the lead section needs improvement. I see two major problems.</p>
<p>1. White vs black - Recent changes have resulted in the words "white" and "black" used a total of 15 times in just the lead section. This doesn't even count additional use of the the word African American. The overemphasis on racial labels is way out of balance for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> standards.</p>
<p>2. Lead has been getting longer recently, and it no longer flows chronologically through his life as it once did. The recent growth seems largely due to redundant edits. (i.e., the recent additions in the first paragraph of the lead are redundant with the content that follows: in simpler terms, although the wording is different, we say the same things twice).</p>
<p>BOTTOM LINE: I think we can improve the lead.</p>
<p>In the better large WP articles I have worked with:</p>
<p>1. The lead may summarize details which are covered again (in usually greater detail) in sections which follow.</p>
<p>2. We generally do not use the lead as the primary source of details which are not also presented in additional sections.</p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, suggestions anyone?</p>

<p>For another major article I help maintain, which had similar problems with the lead, I posted a working copy on the talk page and then suggested we use the space following for suggested revisions, and have a chance for discussion, rather than doing it on the article's own page. This way, it won't keep changing while we (any sincere editors who wish to participate) briefly attend to improving the lead through an informal WP collaboration here on the talk page.

<p>Throughout the final 20 years of his life, he maintained this standing through a nationwide network of core supporters in many communities, including educators, ministers, and businessmen, especially those who were black and/or liberal-thinking on social and educational issues. He gained access to top national leaders in politics, philanthropy and education, and was awarded honorary degrees including a doctorate. Critics called his network of supporters the "Tuskegee Machine."</p>
<p>Dr. Washington was criticized by the leaders of the new <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, which was formed in 1909, especially <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._DuBois_289a.html" title="W.E.B.

However, while he did some aggressive civil rights work secretively, such as funding court cases, <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. in general, he seemed to truly believe in skillful accommodation to many of the social realities of the age of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a>. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. While accepting current realities, he also clearly had his eyes on a better future and knew education was a major tool to accomplish it.</p>
<p>His philosophy and tireless work on education issues helped him enlist both the moral and substantial financial support of many <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philanthropist.html" title="Philanthropist">philanthropists</a>.

Through provision of millions of dollars and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matching_funds.html" title="Matching funds">matching funds</a> programs, they stimulated local community contributions (black and white) to eventually establish and operate over 5,000 <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosenwald_school.html" title="Rosenwald school">small community schools</a> for the betterment of blacks throughout <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">the South</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The schools were a source of much local community pride and were of priceless value to African-American families during those troubled times in public education. This work was a major part of his legacy and was continued and expanded for many years after his death.</p>
<p>In addition to his substantial contributions in the field of education, Dr. Washington did much to improve the overall friendship and working relationship between the races in the United States.

<dd>OK, comments, suggestion, etc.? Personally, I think his biggest significance was education, and that he considered that his most important life's work, not race relations per se. Perhaps he could foresee that the Constitution would lead others to improve those things more than he could. I have read his papers. The guy worked tirelessly, but most of his time was spent on education-related work, and that is where he ended up accomplishing the most IMHO. But, with that said, this needs to be NPOV, so do other editors and our facts sources agree with what I said? That's what should be our criteria.

<p>"Through his own personal experience, he knew that good educations were a major and powerful tool for individuals to collectively accomplish that."</p>
<p>Is this sentence trying to say that Washington realized that the collective education of black people would be a major accomplishment? This sentence is extremely awkward.</p>

   To whom it may concern:
</pre>
<p>I have a question. I have been reading many of the articles in this website about Booker T. Washington, but I am having trouble finding out what he did to help African-Americans and slavery. I need information soon.</p>
<pre>
                  Thank you.

<dd>Our mission with Wikipedia is to provide a fact-based <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> balanced article. In the current version online, we have included both praise and criticism of Dr. Washington. You learn a lot working for years on an article like this. However, I am just one of thousands of WP editors, so the following is my personal understanding only. I will try to summarize.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Booker T. Washington was a player during a comparatively short period of time of a much longer and continuing situation. You have to view his life in that context.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. Young Booker was just a child when slavery was abolished in the United States, so he really had no role in making that happen. That entire process is another long and complicated story, but the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_Amendment_0ec2.html" title="13th Amendment">13th Amendment</a> to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Constitution_3436.html" title="U.S. Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> in late 1865 was the final action to make it permanent nationwide.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. Unquestionably, final resolution of freedom from the institution of legalized slavery was a breakthrough in 1865 for the people we today call <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a>. However, they still faced (and many continue to face in 2007) obstacles of many types in participating in the American dream ideals: "All men [and women] are created equal" and the right to "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. Among the obstacles which come to mind are individual prejudice, often the result of mere ignorance and/or learned from parents and social observation. As humans, we naturally fear the strange and unknown. By getting to know individuals of other ethnic heritage and/or learning about them, we have less of that natural fear. I am 55 years old. Under relaxed social settings in the era I grew up, many of us have made friends of individuals our parents would not have had contact with at all in an age of segregation. In his case, I think Booker was very lucky as a teenage to go to work in the home of <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola_Ruffner_236b.html" title="Viola Ruffner">Viola Ruffner</a>, where they got to know each other and learned from each other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5. In Booker's era, there were big problems with legalized discrimination (i.e. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_laws_6b62.html" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow laws</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a>), the longstanding lack of education at all (i.e. Virginia's laws after 1831 which prohibited teaching slaves to read, and lack of resources and schools after 1865), and even later, the inferior educations offered blacks under <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separate_but_equal.html" title="Separate but equal">separate but equal</a> policies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6. Booker had apparently learned at a personal level that practical approaches paid off with practical results. This was true as Viola Ruffner, the white lady he worked for performing household duties (after he had worked at some really rough manual labor jobs), showed him as a teenager that an education would earn respect, a better ability to chose his work, and the money to buy better living conditions. All of that would essentially generate more self esteem and often (but not always) accomplish more equal treatment from others (regardless of color).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7. You asked "what he did to help African-Americans..." He helped bring education to millions of African Americans a legacy which continues today. He also helped everyone (including white people) better understand the plight of the blacks after the end of slavery and see that they could be valuable contributing members of a better society for all, primarily through earning their own way, and that could best be enabled through good education(s).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>8. At his time in our history, education and public awareness and understanding were the areas where he could make the most difference. Add a practical and peaceful approach, and his focus on goals which he could achieve, you have essentially embraced his values.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>9. His values attracted others to help him achieve his goals. Like Viola Ruffner, he developed respect among people like <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Rogers_f354.html" title="Henry H. Rogers">Henry H. Rogers</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Rosenwald_77c4.html" title="Julius Rosenwald">Julius Rosenwald</a>. Each of those men started out from very modest settings, and had found success through hard work and using their heads. Each had experienced an early business failure, and had done hard manual labor. In later successfully developing huge businesses which made them wealthy, Rogers and Rosenwald each had undoubtedly learned that racial barriers and ignorance were harmful to their goals. So, they were in step morally and business-wise with Dr. Washington, and in a position to really help him at practical levels, providing him with good advice, leadership, and lots of money. (Note, not <i>just</i> money).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>10. We don't know for sure, but I don't think I am alone in suspecting that Washington and his key supporters realized that the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Founding_Fathers_da63.html" title="Founding Fathers">Founding Fathers</a> had laid the constitutional basis for the work of others to eventually overturn such fundamentally unconstitutional practices as the segregation, Jim Crow laws, inferior schools, etc., some of which had been woven into laws, as had slavery earlier.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, Booker probably realized that these would take some time and individuals educated and experienced in the practice and conversant in the technicalities and details of American law. That is <i>not</i> to say that he didn't want to see the legal actions happen. Rather, we have a strong clue to this in some of his discreet support of early court cases.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>11. It is important to understand how we arrive at the effective laws which govern the United States. The Congress passes them, and then they are subject to opinions of the Attorney General in interpreting them, further adjusted by decisions of the courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court having the last say. These concepts are also true at state and local levels, with some issues subject to review at the Federal level also. That is a complicated and ever-changing process, and some changes in laws as initially passed by legislators at each level and take many years and a lot of legal work to become effective.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly, there is ample evidence that Henry Rogers knew all that. As a businessman, it is well-documented that Rogers sought ways to get what he wanted done without resorting to courts whenever possible. However, we know he also used them when necessary, and paid for skilled legal help to accomplish his ends. After fist fights and action in local courts failed, he had to take the powerful <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway_33a2.html" title="Chesapeake and Ohio Railway">Chesapeake and Ohio Railway</a> to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_Supreme_Court_6d6a.html" title="West Virginia Supreme Court">West Virginia Supreme Court</a> to win the right-of way through <a href="../../../r/a/l/Raleigh_County%2C_West_Virginia_24e6.html" title="Raleigh County, West Virginia">Jenny Gap</a> without which his <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginian_Railway_25f5.html" title="Virginian Railway">Virginian Railway</a> could not have been built to provide competition in <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> shipping to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Roads_cf0c.html" title="Hampton Roads">Hampton Roads</a>. However, Rogers saw the courts as a costly and time-consuming last resort in reaching his goals.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>During their many cruises aboard the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanawha_%281899%29.html" title="Kanawha (1899)"><i>Kanawha</i></a>, it is more than likely that Henry Rogers would have discussed the legal process and shared his views with Washington as they discussed how to accomplish the betterment of the circumstances of the blacks in the South. We know that Julius Rosenwald had also been having similar discussions with other <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a> businessmen for years before joining forces with Washington in 1912, and serving on the Board of <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_University_4642.html" title="Tuskegee University">Tuskegee</a>, work which he continued long after Washington died in 1915, until his own death in 1932.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>12. Without Booker T. Washington's work (and those of many others), it is questionable whether the legal work which has already been accomplished to gain rights that are constitutionally guaranteed to all Americans would have yet been done. (i.e. Would the lawyers, many black, who argued <i><a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_vs_Board_of_Education_4799.html" title="Brown vs Board of Education">Brown vs Board of Education</a></i> have even become educated to learn their practice and use it successfully?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>13. I think Booker T. Washington chose practical compromises with current realities to gain important long-term goals. The term "Accommodator" was accurate, but only fairly applied when you stand back and look at WHY he was accommodating. The fact is that our politicians in the U.S. at every level of government do this very day in a democratic system, compromising their individual needs and desires where a consensus with others is often needed to get anything done. Of course, we also have the lawyers to fight for principles when consensus fails to protects the concepts of the Constitution. That is why the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a> is both widely unpopular and very valuable to each of us.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>14. I would also point out that <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and others had to compromise certain principles at the time of the founding of the U.S.. Slavery and equality were divisive issues whcih would have prevented the Union from being formed had that not been compromise. However, although Jefferson and others had to accommodate a consensus for the short-term at the time, they clearly knew that they were including constitutional principles into the final documents which created the Union and with the Supreme Court, the mechanism that would later accomplish what couldn't be done immediately. If we chose to consider Dr. Washington an "Accommodator", we certainly should apply the same label to Thomas Jefferson.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an American in 2007, I think the work of Jefferson, Booker T. Washington, Henry Rogers, and Julius Rosenwald and many many others have all helped make our country a better place. I am grateful for their lives and contributions. Today, as many have said, I also think that <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> as practiced in the U.S. is still an experiment and work in progress. And whoever you are, you get to participate and make a difference in our future.</dd>
