<p>I haven't watched the series, but I was just looking through the article and just in what's there, I think there are probably some rather major spoilers (I stopped reading after I reached something I thought was spoilerish). I don't know, as I haven't seen the series, but should there be a spoiler warning here?</p>

<p>I'm in the process of editing this article at the moment since I think Boogiepop Phantom is a great series and deserves as much effort put into it as other quality anime shows, however I've never really tackled such large projects on my own before (I'm more a bit part editor), and there are several aspects of large scale editing that I am unfamiliar with, such as adding pictures, etc. Any and all help from editors with more experience than I would be greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod-Emperor_985d.html" title="User:God-Emperor">Hellspawn</a> 23:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had already intended to work on this page, but I need to rewatch the anime first. I already have a pile of notes for this from the commentary track and other sources. I expect to rewatch it around Christmas, so I should be able to help in January. <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 22:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've started padding out this article with the plot summary, though I don't know exactly what format I should do it in. I decided to focus on one plot thread at a time, starting with the major characters such as Manaka and Boogiepop Phantom and then moving onto the minor characters such as Jonouchi Hisashi and Shizue Wakata. I also added an Allusions section, so if anyone feels like expanding upon either of these or correcting my mistakes then please feel free. I could do with the help. <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod-Emperor_985d.html" title="User:God-Emperor">Hellspawn</a> 23:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One question: Should a plot summary be in past tense or present tense? Also, what is considered too much info for a plot description? <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod-Emperor_985d.html" title="User:God-Emperor">Hellspawn</a> 23:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Normally I would use past-tense. Plot descriptions should not include every minor plot point – people can watch the series for that – but should include the major plot developments. A good plot summary could be a little difficult with this series, but since many of the plot developments are only relevant to single episodes we can skip them. <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 22:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thought I'd paste this here incase anyone ever needed it again and since I had typed it already anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manaka Kisaragi</li>
</ul>
<p>Manaka Kisaragi was born a "natural evolution". Dr Kisugi had given Mayumi Kisaragi an injection of the Towa Organization's evolution drug, resulting in her being born after only about 5 months premature, but bearing the physical appearance of a baby born after the full 10 months pregnancy. However, Mayumi could not remember ever giving birth or being pregnant, and found that she could not remember anything new after her pregnancy for more than a few minutes. She is always carrying around a note pad so that she can keep her memories in written form instead. Due to her illness, she was taken away to a hospital and Manaka kept in the care of her Grandmother Meyu. Meyu had despised the fact that Manaka's father had left her mother during pregnancy, and also that Manaka was born out of wedlock. This and the fact that she was born 5 months premature led to Meyu calling Manaka a devil child. To prevent rumours from spreading, Meyu had used the fact that Mayumi had a home birth to claim that Manaka was still born and keep her a secret. To keep up this charade, Manaka was never allowed to be seen by others and was kept inside for her entire childhood.</p>
<p>Manaka continued to grow at an unnatural rate, and soon learned of her ability to see butterflies of light that no one else could see. These butterflies were the memories of others she gained by being in contact with them. Just prior to the Pillar of Light, Meyu had become ill and realized she was soon to die. To prevent the devil child from getting free and wreaking havoc on human society, Meyu crept up on Manaka from behind and strangled her with a thin wire. As Manaka lay dead on the floor, the Pillar of Light pierced the sky. As it dissipated, Manaka was ressurected from death. Echoes Pillar of Light had enhanced her evolution beyond what it was before, such that she had reached what would be the pinnacle of human evolution. She also gained full knowledge of what had occured during the Pillar of Light. Despite the fact that Manaka had been killed by her own Grandmother, she continued to look after Meyu. Just before her death, Meyu has a picture of the two of them taaken together, so that others would know that Manaka is her daughter rather than Mayumi's. Meyu died nearly a month after the Pillar of Light, and free at last, Manaka wandered the city. Coming into contact with so many people, she absorbed their memories and through this combined knowledge she gained a "superior philosophy" and a "higher intelligence". She learned how the universe works and words of knowledge stream forth from her mouth. Manaka however seals away this information by limiting her speeach to echoing back what others say to her in a similar manner to Echoes. Manaka learned one more thing - of the existence of the universal concoiusness, and that one day she will become light and ascend just like Ecgoes did during the Pillar of Light.</p>
<p>She decided to help show humans the truth, but by using the past rather than with words. Over the period of several days, she showed various memories to others she metv, including Jonouchi Hisashi, to whom she gifted a vision of the Manticore and Saotome Masami with another of their victims. Due to a lack of food and hydration however, she collapses and is taken to a hospital. After being treated, she leaves the hospital just in time to avoid confronting Snake Eye. Outside the hospital, she encounters Mamoru and Sayoko Oikawa. Manaka had spent her entire life alone, so she took Mamorou's memories of playing the pied piper and created another phantom called Poom Poom who would be her friend. Poom Poom carried around red balloons offering friendship to those he met. However those who accepted a balloon had their inner child drawn out of them and what was left behind was little more than a shell of their former self. The actions of Manaka and Poom Poom drew the attention of Boogiepop, who forced Poom Poom to go away leaving Manaka on her own, whom Boogiepop claimed was an enemy of the world.</p>
<p>Manaka ran away in fear from Boogiepop, but her flight led her into the path of Boogiepop Phantom, who proceeded to strangle her with her metal wire. The real Boogiepop intervened, stating that Manaka has lost most of her power and will die soon. Manaka ran away from the two, and in a fit of depression despaired that she would die alone, her life a failure. Just as she began to die however, Echoes/Echoes Phantom approached Manaka and offered her his hand so that she could transcend just as he did. Filled with new hope, Manaka released all her combined memories and helped several characters of the series come to terms with their traumatic pasts. Manaka went to the Prefectural Hospital where Mayumi was being taken care of, and surrounded by light, proceeded to show Mayumi memories of her pregnancy and giving birth to Manaka, as well as Manaka's childhood. Mayumi bursts into tears with the realization that she has a daughter. Manaka began to leave, telling her mother that she was glad she was born. A pillar of light rises from the Hospital, signalling Manaka's departure.</p>
