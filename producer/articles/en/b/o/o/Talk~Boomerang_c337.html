<p>Never used for hunting? Can this be true? Is the whole idea of a (returning) boomerang not to be able to throw it into a flock of birds and if you don't hit one, then it comes back so you can have another go? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 11:53 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>very much so. it was, as now, almost entirely an object of recreation.</p>
<p>its true- there was apparently very little use of a returning boomerang for hunting.</p>

<p>I have witnessed a large boomerang at a tournament hit a sparrow, a very small bird. The boomerang fell from the sky and the bird flew on. Not what you would want for hunting birds.--169.240.91.251 19:00, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not a boomerang expert but I have been making and throwing boomerangs since 1985. I have mostly made and thrown the traditional two-armed boomerangs but occasionally done other shapes too. I have some comments on boomerangs that I like to share. Note that these comments mainly apply to the traditional two-armed boomerangs. I might get around to work these comments into the article someday. But perhaps someone else will do that for me? Anyway, for now, here goes:</p>
<p><b>Airfoil</b></p>
<p>Boomerangs are usually propeller shaped just as the article says. That is, the wings are slightly "twisted". But it is a common misconception that a boomerang has to be airfoil shaped. We usually do make them airfoil shaped since at-least in theory that gives them slightly more airtime. But if you ever tried to throw an airfoil shaped boomerang upside down (round surface outwards/down) you should have noticed that it flies just as good or almost as good. So airfoil shape is just an added luxury and in no way necessary.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>you are quite simply incorrect, in most cases throwing a boomerang "upside down (round surface outwards/down)" as you say will result in the boomerang crashing hard. Unless it is a boomerang intended for near vertical delivery, or unless you make corrections in your delivery or unless your 'airfoil' is not very aerodynamic... They can however be thrown from either end without much affecting the flight. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 19:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p><b>Right-handed / left-handed boomerangs</b></p>
<p>A boomerang is made either for right handed throwers or for left handed throwers. A right-handed boomerang when thrown the normal way turns left. And of course a left-handed boomerang turns right. Trying to throw a boomerang with the wrong hand is almost impossible since the correct throwing angle then gets very awkward. So sorry all you left handed people out there, you can not throw the same boomerangs as the rest of us throw. (On the other hand, we can not throw yours.)</p>
<p><b>Why boomerangs return</b></p>
<p>As the article says, intuitively it is not especially strange that a rotating object does have a bent flight path. But <i><b>why</b></i> a boomerang is turning the way it does is actually still a scientific mystery. (At-least it was last time I checked.) Lot's of people and even aerodynamic engineers have tried to come up with an explanation. However if you check the explanations that people usually come up with you will notice they imply that a boomerang would turn in the other direction. But empirical evidence shows all those explanations are wrong. Some aerodynamic researchers have even spent a whole lot of valuable supercomputer time on the problem but still could not explain it. We who make boomerangs of course by experience know what shapes cause more or less turn etc. But no one knows why, yet. Personally I find it rather nice that such a simple device as a boomerang still can not be explained by science.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>again, no, the Klutz book on boomerangs shows a mathematical model of a boom in flight, and it corresponds well to the timelapse photo of an actual boomerang. For any given airfoil/weight/size/etc. there is a specific way that the forces interact in flight. It's just hard to generalise to a formula, because of so many variables, including how it is thrown. As you point out below, the flight is a figure-8, on one end it's flight turns right, at the other end it turns left. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 19:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look at the wings as they rotate, and it is easy to understand. The "airspeed" of the wings when they are at the top is forward velocity plus rotational velocity. The airspeed of the wings when they are down is forward velocity minues rotational velocity. The wings generate the most lift when they are vertical pointing up, and the least when they are veritical pointing down. Just like a bicycle wheel, if you have a spinning boomerang, and you torque it with more force at the top, then the right hand rule in physics says it will turn 90 out of phase with that torque. That's the quick and easy answer, the full principals build off of that. It is possible for a boomerang to lose all forward velocity, at which point there is no torque, and the boomerang hovers down. A figure 8 (also called "s'ing out") at the end indicates that the boomerang needs some tuning or work. Trick catch boomerangs always get to a no forward velocity hover - how else could people do hand-stand foot catches?</p>
<p><b>How boomerangs fly</b></p>
<p>It is a common misconception that a boomerang flies in a circle. But it doesn't! A boomerang actually flies in an 8 shape! Although usually it comes back to us after the first half of the 8 shape so we only see the first "circle". If your boomerang is good enough (is able to retain enough energy / rotating energy) and you throw it well enough it will pass over your head after the first "circle" and then start turning in the other direction in another "circle" and then come back to you from your back. It seems it would continue to do the 8 shape if it could retain enough energy. But most boomerangs usually "fall out of the sky" due to energy loss already after the first "circle". Air resistance is a bitch. It seems the reason it does a 8 is that while doing it's "circle" it slowly tips over and eventually that makes it turn in the other direction. But as you should know by now, trying to explain <i><b>why</b></i> a boomerang flies as it does is not for us mere mortals.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>except for the last sentence this is quite correct, a boomerang will continue to fly in figure eights until the pattern's precession turns enough that the wind is coming from the wrong direction relative to the boomerang's flight... or of course, when the boomerang runs out of either rotational speed or airspeed. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 19:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Boomerang safety</b></p>
<p>Boomerangs do come back. And they are pointy and rotate fast. They hurt a lot when they hit you. And if they hit you in the eye that eye might be destroyed. So here is some safety advice for the first time boomerang thrower and for any one else standing close to boomerangs being thrown:</p>
<p>1: Boomerangs are destroyed if they hit anything hard like asphalt. And boomerangs tend to get stuck in trees. And they are very good at smashing windows. So boomerangs need a lot of space, especially if thrown by beginners. So you need a big lawn. An empty football field or similar usually is ideal.</p>
<p>2: Watch out for birds, dogs and other people before you throw. You don't want to hurt anyone / anything else, do you? Note that a boomerang thrown by a beginner might turn upward and then come straight down at high speed BEHIND the thrower. So the proper place for onlookers to stand is some distance behind the thrower. Not in front, not on the side and not close behind of the thrower.</p>
<p>3: Professional throwers and beginners usually try to catch the boomerang. But that tends to hurt the hands a lot, especially if the boomerang is heavy. Personally I like it to land in front of my feet.</p>
<p>4: Boomerangs move in a weird way. It takes time to become familiar with how boomerangs move. Beginners that try to step out of the way of incoming boomerangs often step into the way of them instead. But keep on trying to step out of the way, eventually you will learn. Pain does seem to speed up learning...</p>
<p>5: The most dangerous spot the boomerang can hit on the body is the eyes. So that is the part you want to protect at all cost. Although a hit anywhere else on your body does hurt a lot that usually causes no critical injuries. Even a lost tooth can be fixed. But a lost eye can not be fixed. So to protect the eyes is the first priority. However the two intuitive ways to protect the eyes do not work. Stepping out of the way often fails for beginners. Reaching out the hand in the air and trying to stop the boomerang also fails. That is due to that humans tend to put the hand towards the rotating centre of the boomerang. But if you look at the shape of a two-armed boomerang you will notice that the rotating centre is in mid air, not in mid wood. So the boomerang usually just slips past your "protecting" hand and straight into your face.</p>
<p>But there are two easy and well working ways to protect your eyes from an incoming boomerang. And both methods protect the mouth fairly well at the same time. The easiest way is to simply turn your back towards it. Sure, a hit in the back hurts a lot, but it usually is not dangerous. The other good way is to cover your eyes with the palm of your hands. Note that the normal way to cover eyes that most people use does not work well enough. (That is, to put the fingers over the eyes and the palms resting on the upper part of the cheeks.) Since a boomerangs pointy end can slip between the protecting fingers. Instead put your hands slightly higher so it is the palm of the hand that covers the eyes. A boomerang can not pass through a palm.</p>
<p>So what I usually do is to first try to step out of the way, if that fails I prefer to cover my eyes. Since covering the eyes is quicker then turning the back towards it. Of course I start raising my hands towards the boomerang / face already as I start stepping out of the way. So stepping out of the way is a good reflex, what you need to keep in mind is how to use your hands properly.</p>
<p>Well, I hope this did not scare anyone off from trying boomerangs. They are great fun so do try them!</p>

<dd>that safety advice is good, but can be simplified: the boomerang can strike anything within several hundred feet of the thrower. It can break or hurt anything it hits, and can get caught in any tree within sight. I have personally seen a boomerang land nearly half a mile from the thrower.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>an area LARGER than a footbal field would be best for a beginner. The best boomerang tournament I attended was held on a sod farm, several miles of lawn in all directions. Just remember that you are the target, and try to learn with an inexpensive boomerang, preferably made of 'softer' material than wood or carbon composite or aluminum. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 19:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just read in the German Wikipedia article about boomerangs that since the Kylie (hunting boomerang / throwing stick / non-returning boomerang) can be thrown very far with great precision the Australian army during World War I were equipped with "boomerang hand grenades". Guess that is the most dangerous boomerang ever invented.</p>

<p>I've added a "citation required" tag to the "History" section, which currently states that there "is little to no evidence that returning boomerangs were ever used as hunting tools". If so, then then there needs to be something further on what they <i>were</i> used for. Right now it merely says generally that boomerangs and other hunting sticks also had religious and recreational uses. If, as stated, Australian Aborigines have used (returning) boomerangs for thousands of years, there should be some indication of for what purpose, if it wasn't hunting. Hopefully someone can clear this section up. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 17:11, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the Competitions and records:events section, it says 'Aussie Round: Boomerangs are thrown from the center of a bullseye...', shouldn't it be 'centre' given that this is an Australian article. If no one objects, I'll change this myself.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the Trivia section, it says 'The boomerang sport in Brazil is growing fast with many news: special plywood created for boomerangs (BWoods), Kellogg's company inserting five million boomerangs in cereal boxes, and the First Pan-American Championship set for August 2005'. The 'news' seems out of place. Perhaps whoever wrote that could review it.</p>

<p>Lift and drag are forces, but speed and rotational inertia are not. The article states: "forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc. 'attempt' to reach equilibrium".
