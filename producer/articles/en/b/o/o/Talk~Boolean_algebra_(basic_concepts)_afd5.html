<p>This article is intended to cover the basic, common usage of the term "Boolean algebra". This is the one taught in middle school and high school to everyone, not the more complex "Boolean algebra" theory which mathematicians take in college. Therefore, please don't add any material on "homomorphism", "isomorphism", "rings", "ideals", "filters", "axiomatic bases", "duality" or "lattices" here, those belong in the other article. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:14, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article may also contain certain simplifications to make it more accessible to a wider audience. Think of these as similar to the Dalton model of the atom, which had finite spherical electrons in circular orbits. While not technically correct, that model does allow a nice intro to electron shells for those not yet able to understand the more complex probability functions which conform to modern atomic theory. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 16:57, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So I don't entirely agree with Pmanderson's systematic change to "Boolean logic", which is apparently a correction to Aristotelean logic obtained by allowing <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuously_true.html" title="Vacuously true">vacuous truth</a>. See <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>. The wording will need to be tweaked, but I'm not sure that's the right tweak, and I think we should probably let StuRat finish.

(BTW the notice at the top claiming that it's closely related to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a> seems to be just wrong--the syllogistic described involves quantified statements, which PC doesn't.) --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 15:14, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that you, and other mathematicians, should edit the "dab" here, to get it the way you like. I will expect the same coutesy, however, so that I, and everyone else in the world who isn't a mathematician, should have the right to edit the "dab" which points to this article. For example, I don't want it called "count noun/mass noun" or "propositional calculus" or anything like that which the non-mathematician audience will not understand. In short, a "dab" should be written for the audience of the article to which it points, not for the audience in which it is placed. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 16:52, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't think of calling it "mass noun"; that was an attempt to get people to understand my point when I couldn't think of a more-direct wording. But "basic concepts" isn't really right either; it suggests that the study of the algebraic structures called "Boolean algebras" is a "more advanced" version of the topic treated in this article. I hope you've understood by now that that is not the case. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:02, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To mathematicians, that is true. But, this article is written for non-mathematicians, and they don't know, or care, that this is one type of all the other "Boolean algebras". Think of it as the same as the relationship between the words "God" and "god" or "Dad" and "dad". Depending on the context, the words refer to different things. You wouldn't insist that a priest refer to "the god we worship under Christianity", rather than just "God" or that a child say "the dad which is my father", rather than just "Dad". Similarly, from the pt of view of the intended audience for this article, there may be other "Boolean algebras", but that doesn't mean they can't refer to the one they are familiar with as "Boolean algebra". <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 18:22, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Better maybe; still not good enough. The algebra of subsets of a given set is not a special case of Boolean algebra; it's a special case of <i>a</i> Boolean algebra, and much of the article is not actually about it.</p>
<p>I still haven't seen any clear indication that you understand the distinction. I would be willing to propose a 48-hour cease-fire while you go learn it (it's really not that hard, and I'm willing to help). Of course I couldn't enforce it for anyone else, but most people are reasonable. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:54, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see how it's relevant to the mathematician's article, but not how it matters to non-mathematicians. As for halting devlopment of this article, I don't want to do that, as I've already seen two people try to change this into a clone of the mathematician's article, and the longer I leave it unattended the more damage will be done here. At this point I am focusing on adding content, I will look it over for "tweaks" after I finish that phase. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What's the first thing you need to know, to train a dog? More than the dog. An elementary understanding of the algebraic concept would vastly improve your presentation, even if aimed at people who don't want to know about the algebraic concept.</dd>
<dd>The other thing is, your "audience" concept works for textbooks, not so much for an encyclopedia. If you expect mathematicians to stay out of the article (long-term) even if you say things that aren't true, things that would actually <i>hinder</i> someone from understanding the mathematical concept, that's not going to happen. There's a serious need for the article you're writing and we'll owe you a debt of thanks, but it needs to be written correctly. You'll have a much better shot at doing that if you gain just a slightly broader understanding. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 19:13, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that knowing all the complexities will make explaining the simple part easier. In fact, I've seen just the opposite. PhD's frequently can't relate to students who lack their level of understanding, and say things like "that should be obvious" when asked a question they consider stupid. For example, Einstein was apparently a poor lecturer. My Dad (or should I say "the dad which is genetically my father") attended a lecture of his at Princeton. As a computer programmer, I've often found it useful to have non-programmers review my documentation, which tended to contain programmer jargon. Even with a concerted effort, is it often difficult to tailor documentation for the intended audience, rather than for yourself. If the author is a member of the intended audience, this problem is greatly reduced. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not a question of knowing complexities; the distinction involved is not really particularly complex.

<dd>Using that logic, we can't have any mention of Newtonian physics, since it's technically not correct, in that it ignores effects of relativity, etc. We also can't include Dalton's model of the atom, or any chemical bond notation, since all are "incorrect" two-dimensional approximations of the true 3D bonds.

<p>No question about it, things are looking better. But there's still a serious missing transition in the middle of the article. What's the connection supposed to be between the sections from "truth tables" on, and the algebra-of-sets stuff that constitutes the first half? Needs to be made clear.</p>
<p>For that matter, the intro suggests that the whole article is about the algebra of sets, which first of all isn't true, and if it were true it would mean this isn't the article we've been needing (it would be a candidate for a merge with <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">algebra of sets</a>).</p>
<p>A smaller point: Is the algebra of sets really "sometimes called Boolean logic", as the intro claims? Not a usage I'm familiar with. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:45, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm still working on merging the material I "stole" with the new material I added. What we do with the intro somewhat depends on where we end up putting the article. My suggestion is that we place it under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>. If you agree, please add your support to the talk page there.

<dd>I originally came to Boolean Algebra because of the "too complex" tag (somebody has since removed it). What I'm trying to do is provide a basic intro to all the Boolean concepts for somebody who knows nothing about any of it. Surely a place can be found to put that in one article. Breaking it up into multiple articles would make things as hard to understand for newbies as it is now, maybe even worse. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 00:45, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your intention is admirable.&#160;:) However, this article is an incoherent amalgam of a lot of things. The first part is about union and intersection of sets, operations which were baptized "or" and "and". The second part deals with "or" and "and" for real, as elements in a logical table; these are not sets anymore. Then, what follows is the English usage of "and" and "or", which is again, something different.</dd>

<dd>Providing a "less technical" version so that the "technical" tag could be removed, was never quite the right motivation, and this is at the heart of many of the misunderstadings here.</dd>
<dd>In fact, slapping a "technical" tag on <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> was never justified; it could justifiably have been removed immediately. No one would put a similar tag on <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">Group (mathematics)</a>. Presumably the reason it was put there in the first place was that visitors were expecting a different concept, one taught in other places as "Boolean algebra".</dd>
<dd>And we do need an article on that concept, whatever it is. To be honest I'm not sure just what the boundaries of that concept are. But it should be thought of as an encyclopedia article on that concept, not as an introductory course. It will be naturally more accessible, simply because the <i>concept</i> is more accessible. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:57, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd add that if someone <i>wanted</i> to write an entry-level article about the study of Boolean algebras, I wouldn't be opposed to that on principle, though I'm not sure why you wouldn't start with a simpler structure, say <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Group (mathematics)">groups</a>. But it would be a very different article from the one I think StuRat is trying to write. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:11, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
