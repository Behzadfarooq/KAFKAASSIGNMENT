<dd>2) CAD - union / intersection / subtract /splits (performed using element of "n-1" dimensions) , etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a) 2D CAD/drafting/drawing/architecture software - such as patterns for wood paneling having the area inside a window frame subtracted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>b) 3D surfacing packages</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>c) 3D solid modeling packages</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Database - discuss "UNION" and "UNION ALL" SQL statements</dd>
</dl>
<p>B) Transitions:</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>1)Transition into sets</s></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2)Transition out of sets - talk about Boolean algebra of two elements/states to transition to truth tables.</dd>
</dl>
<p><s>C) Graphics</s></p>
<dl>
<dd><s>1) Provide links for each symbol to an image page (for use by those with browsers which don't support set notation symbols). Also add text explaining the links.</s></dd>

<p>I don't particularly mind the move of what used to be here to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boole%27s_syllogistic.html" title="Boole's syllogistic">Boole's syllogistic</a>, but I don't think "Boolean logic" is really going to work as a name for this article. For parts of the article, such as "Properties" and "Truth tables", it would be a good name if we were naming things ourselves, but we shouldn't be doing that. As far as I know there is no common usage of the phrase "Boolean logic" to represent these topics.</p>
<p>For the stuff about the algebra of sets, it's not even a good name. That isn't logic at all; it's baby set theory. Logic is about propositions and sets aren't propositions. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:08, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is the best place for this content because:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The article that was here didn't seem to be about "Boolean logic".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) This content needed a home, and the old name was clearly unsatisfactory.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) I disagree with you that this content is not "Boolean logic". I believe that it is. It also includes material from related areas; however, I believe that is permissable. For example, in an article on DC power, I would expect to see some mention of AC, particularly the similarities and differences between the two, and perhaps Edison's pro-DC / anti-AC bias.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, while this may or may not be the ideal placement, I believe it is a substantial improvement over the previous situation. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:13, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, just what type of things would you like to see in an article about "Boolean logic"&#160;? Perhaps I can tweak the content of the current article to include that material. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not that there's stuff I call "Boolean logic" that's missing; it's that much of the material already here doesn't belong under that name (specifically, the algebra-of-sets material). But maybe even that's not the main issue.</dd>
<dd>Here's the thing: People were frustrated because they came to the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> article expecting to be able to read it, because they'd studied "Boolean algebra" in school. The reason they couldn't read it wasn't that it was too technical, but rather that it was about a different topic entirely, but there was no easy way for them to figure that out. So we want a place to redirect them. Now, is it reasonable to call that place "Boolean logic" when it's (1) not primarily about logic and (2) not a name they've ever heard? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

While there is a difference, they would likely figure out that if one article doesn't have the info they need, perhaps the other will. I've provided a "dab" to direct them here, with as descriptive language as I could come up with, for what they will find here. I can't come up with a better way to tell them "Hey buddy, you want this article&#160;!", at least nothing short of adding a disambiguation page. That, unfortunately, would upset many of the PhDs who don't want the current article under <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> moved, since they would argue "it's the only VALID article on Boolean algebra, the rest is just computer and electronics crap that doesn't count." <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:43, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be assuming an attitude that doesn't exist. Personally I wouldn't be opposed to a solution that included moving the current <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> to something like Boolean algebra (mathematical structure) or Boolean algebra (algebraic structure). Of course that by itself doesn't solve the problem of what to call the current <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article. BTW this is also discussed on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a> page.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to add that your dab notice at the top of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> looks fine. Perhaps it could be adapted into the first sentence of the current <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> article -- that sentence is neither accurate nor descriptive of the content of the article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:31, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>StuRat: I don't think anyone is saying that the current article at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a> can't be moved. And I don't think anyone has said it is the only valid article on Boolean algebra. In fact there have been several suggestions in various places to name either or both of these articles Boolean Algebra (<i>something</i>), we just haven't yet come up with a consensus what that (those) <i>something</i>(s) should be. And it is certainly <i>not</i> the case that anyone thinks that the other Boolean algebra is "crap". I don't know where you are getting that from? The situation is that there are two <i>different</i> things that are unfortunately <i>both</i> called "Boolean algebra". <i>Both</i> are important. Please believe me when I say that I am <i>very</i> familiar with both of these concepts. I have a background in both computer science, and mathematics and I've been thinking and dealing with <i>both</i> concepts for over thirty years. I think I fully appreciate the importance and the significance of <i>both</i>. On a more personal note, It sounds like you are feeling a bit frustrated. I'm sorry if that is so. If you think that some of us are being unreasonable, then I apologize. But you might want to consider the possibility that you are misunderstanding things. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 18:48, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, someone with experience in both areas&#160;? Sounds like you might be able to help us out. I do feel a bit frustrated, in that most of the comments seem to be destructive ("this is no good as is") not constructive ("it could be improved by doing this..."). My own math experience doesn't go beyond basic calculus, so I'm looking at it primarily from the programmer's point of view. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 19:34, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I <i>have</i> been trying to help out. And again I'm very sorry you are feeling frustrated. But again I think you may be blowing things out of proportion, and some of the things you consider to be "not constructive" may come from your lack of knowledge about some of these things. Did someone actually say "this is no good as is"? Frustration can also come from differences in pace. You may think that all should be resolved in a day or two, when the rest of us are perhaps working with a different time frame in mind. If so I would suggest trying to be more patient and keep in mind there is no real hurry to any of this. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 20:52, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way I would like to point out that others here (e.g. Travatore) probably know as much about this stuff as I do, and I think they have also been trying to help out, and from what I've seen, their remarks have all been constructive. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 21:04, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>StuRat, I'd like to assure you that your efforts are appreciated. The collaborative process is not always pleasant, but in the end we'll have improved the Wikipedia, and you can be proud of having provided an article that was clearly lacking. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <b>Terms</b> section should be greatly simplified, and amplified by links to <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">algebra of sets</a> and the analogous algebra of propositions (approximately the same degree of formality as <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">algebra of sets</a>).

<dl>
<dd>Simplified <b>how</b>&#160;? I've never heard the term "propositions" used in programming. "Sets" is used rarely. More often, a specific application term is used.

<p>So I see Arthur's points; his proposal splits up an agglomeration of related, but not unified, things, into logically distinct topics. But I don't really agree. In common usage "Boolean algebra" seems in fact to be a collection of topics, rather than a single one, much as "algebra" is a collection of topics. We <i>do</i> need an article on that collection of topics, because so many people are looking for it.</p>
<p>The intro needs to <i>explain</i> that it's a collection of topics, and the relationships among them need to be better explored.</p>
<p>Like Arthur, I'm a bit surprised that StuRat emphasizes the algebra-of-sets material, especially given that he says he's coming at it from a programmer's point of view. Programmers, as far as I know (and I have been one, from time to time) have relatively little use for sets, but a lot of use for the true-false semantics. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:38, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was reading a book about electronic logic design, and it stated without giving any examples that: "in fact there are 16 possible boolean functions of two variables (2 input gates), but in practice only six are commonly used, AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XOR". I can find no further information about this - what on earth are the other ten? Try as I might I can't really imagine them, unless they are trivial ones such as always 1 or always 0... anyone got any insight into this, or were the book authors wrong? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 23:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>[QUOTE] Also note that the word OR in English may correspond with either logical OR or logical XOR, depending on the context:</p>

<p>But their is a problem with the second example, I possible could have beef and chicken for dinner, many dishes have both.

"Now turn right OR left." Or some other statement that can only take the XOR operator.</p>

<dd>I don't think that helps. If I say "turn right or left", I'm not really forbidding you to do both; it might be impossible for you to do both, but that's not <i>my</i> fault. So this "or" can just as well be read as inclusive. Really I think the original version is better. A still better example might be a parent saying to a child "you can have ice cream <i>or</i> candy", the clear implication being that "both" is not an option. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:34, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that is not clearer.

<dd>Here's more of a situational example. If two people are making a decision on whether or not to do something, there is no need for discussion if they already agree (both say yes or both say no), but discussion will take place if there is disagreement (if one says yes and the other says no). In this case, the yes or no is the true or false input, with whether discussion will take place being the XOR output. I don't know if it's any clearer, but it's coming at it from a different perspective. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindrain0000_a57c.html" title="User:Braindrain0000">Carl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraindrain0000_b3ff.html" title="User talk:Braindrain0000">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Braindrain0000_7580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Braindrain0000">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:39, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think both you and Freshgavin may be forgetting the context a bit. The discussion is not about what XOR means. It's about under what circumstances the <i>English</i> word "or" <i>means</i> XOR. Carl, your example just doesn't work in that context. "John and Mary will argue if John or Mary wants to go." It sounds like gibberish; it's not a case where the "or" is naturally read as XOR. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:44, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my mind, XOR is more of an "or...but" statement instead of just an "or" statement. For example, John and Mary will argue if John <b>or</b> Mary wants to go <b>but</b> the other one does not. As far as the use of mutually exclusive options, I think the only way you can logically translate a statement as XOR where "or" is the only conjunction is when mutually exclusive options exist. Otherwise, there would need to be something specified (generally via another conjunction) that would indicate this. As XOR means "exclusive or," I do not see why mutually exclusive options would not be a good example. The options are either mutually exclusive by nature (e.g., you may turn left or right at this intersection) or by implication (you must take chemistry or physics but not both) That is by definition. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindrain0000_a57c.html" title="User:Braindrain0000">Carl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraindrain0000_b3ff.html" title="User talk:Braindrain0000">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Braindrain0000_7580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Braindrain0000">contribs</a>)</sup> 04:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clarifying a bit (after re-reading the previous posts), whether the mutual exclusivity exists because of it being impossible to perform both actions or because of an implied prohibition restricting the performance of both actions, the fact is that a person can only choose one of the two actions. I don't think it makes a difference for the purpose of an example of exclusive or. So yes, it is about what XOR means, because we are trying to give an example of its use "by definition" in everyday English. Saying "left or right" has or implying XOR because of impossibility. Saying "ice cream or candy" has or implying XOR because of prohibition. I personally prefer the absolute exclusivity of left or right because it depends not on language nuance (and an understanding of context), but on the fact that left and right are understood to be exclusive of each other. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindrain0000_a57c.html" title="User:Braindrain0000">Carl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraindrain0000_b3ff.html" title="User talk:Braindrain0000">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Braindrain0000_7580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Braindrain0000">contribs</a>)</sup> 04:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're doing it the wrong way around. There's no problem about what XOR means; it's a truth function and we all know precisely what its values are. The problem is to find an English sentence where "or" means XOR. That is, we're talking about the meaning of the word "or" (in that particular context), not about the meaning of XOR.</dd>
<dd>So now we have to get into something much trickier, which is natural-language semantics. In almost all contexts, I think, the natural-language meaning of "or" is not a truth function at all; it takes into account the <i>meanings</i> of the clauses it joins, not just their truth values.</dd>
<dd>Still, we can come up with examples where the <i>closest truth-functional equivalent</i> to the meaning of "or" is XOR. But in doing so, it's useless to give examples where the two possibilities are, by <i>nature</i> as opposed to by the <i>meaning of the sentence</i>, mutually exclusive. How then are you going to determine that the meaning of the sentence excludes the possibility that they're both true? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 04:21, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, is this example clearer&#160;?</p>
<p>"For gender, the user must select male <b>or</b> female." (logical XOR)</p>
<p>I suppose we could have both, or neither, allowed for transsexuals and such, but most computer forms would require that male XOR female be selected. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 12:37, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because when you select exactly one of "male" or "female", you have still selected male-inclusive-or-female. Note that <i>p</i>XOR<i>q</i> <i>implies</i> <i>p</i> ∨ <i>q</i>, no matter what <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> happen to be.</dd>
<dd>In order for it to be an example where the English word "or" means specifically exclusive-or, we <i>have</i> to use an example where it is inherently possible for both conditions to be true at once, and where that possibility is being excluded by <i>the meaning of the sentence</i>, not by outside factors. The candy/ice cream example is, I think, a fairly clear one, but I'm open to others. But the male/female one is <i>not</i> such an example. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 14:44, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I suppose perhaps you meant that the instruction was intended to convey to the user <i>not</i> to mark both "male" and "female", even if he/she had a good reason to do so. That <i>would</i> be an example. The problem is that it's not clear that that's what's intended. In the candy/ice cream case, I think it is clear. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 14:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
