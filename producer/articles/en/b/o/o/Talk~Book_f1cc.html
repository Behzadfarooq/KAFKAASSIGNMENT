<p>1. It grounds the "universal free distribution" concept, central to the Wikipedia, in one of mankind's earliest publications.</p>

<p>Since this article is about books in the traditional sense of printed books, I think we should delete the See also section for Online book databases and lists, to which another item has just been added. I think we should replace this section with a simple see also link to <a href="../../../o/n/-/On-line_book.html" title="On-line book">On-line book</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/o/Talk%7EBook_f1cc.html" title="Edit section: change title">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">change title</span></h3>
<p>I don't think that's really accurate. This article is about the general concept "book", which it sees in a variety of contexts. The first paragraph is a second-order disambiguation page, Either we should use this page "book" as purely a disambiguation page, with a separate page "Printed book,"or we should keep it general and add a "printed book" page. Just removing the online book section isn't enough. (and see my comment on the online books page)</p>

<p>I suppose the above comment is a move proposal, or a redefinition of topic. If so, I oppose it, either way. The article title and its defined subject are in good accord with each other and with the most commonly accepted meaning of "book". There's no need to call it "printed book", nor to vastly expand the scope to beyond the conventional definition of books, namely printed books.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also do not see any good reason to purge the section that discusses the transition to digital. There should be a "main article" link to e-book or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Details like not all books having covers are easily dealt with. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 04:14, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dt>The proposal was in response to the Sept16 note. I've no objection to keeping it as a general article, But it cannot simultaneously be mostly about printed books and also be a general article. Rechecking, I see there's enough content about manuscript books etc, that it might as well be treated as a general article.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04</dt>

<dd>Within limits, it's general. I wouldn't want to see it expand much beyond the scope as defined in the lead though. The topic of <a href="../../../e/-/b/E-books.html" title="E-books">e-books</a> obviously is a big one that needs to keep its own article. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 06:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess you mean the 14 Sept. suggestion that was already acted on. It was certainly a good idea to refer to <a href="../../../o/n/-/On-line_book.html" title="On-line book">on-line book</a> rather than incorporate that material here. But it might be even better to merge it with e-books. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 06:25, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

Even if this If this is an article about books in general, it's disproportionate here, and certainly if it's primarily on the printed book, it's certainly a great deal too much.

<dd>Is this an article about printed book? I'm not entirely sure. I had an impression that this is mostly about the book in general and this encompasses also history. But on the other hand I (having written most of the manuscript section here) have nothing against the idea of a well balanced article and if you think the manuscript section is too long - go ahead. --<a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAethralis_35c5.html" title="User:Aethralis">Aethralis</a> 21:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I do think that paragraph is saying a great deal too much, To go back to pre-literate communication is perhaps excessive.

<dd>I agree that the history of the book should maybe start with <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_tablet.html" title="Clay tablet">clay tablets</a>. Pondered that question myself.

<dd>This is not an external link. As long as there's a wikipedia article on it, it's hard to say why it shouldn't be listed in the see-also section. However, I agree with you anyway. I think that article should be proposed for deletion, and it would likely carry. It's mostly edited by one person, probably related to the site, and has had zero discussion. I can't see why the site is notable enough to warrant an article. But the procedure of proposing for deletion is such a confusing pain, in my experience of having tried it twice, that I think I'll leave it for someone more at ease with the wiki processes. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 04:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Article make the assumption that ALL books from the Victorian era are at risk, I beg to differ. I've got about Twenty Victorian Books and none of them show signs of decay, My theory is that the CHEAPER books (for example poor quality novels or childrens books) were made on pulp based paper and crumbled to dust, I threw out most of my 30 odd year old books because they were disintergrating, I believe that most academic works and other quality books were still printed on high quality Cotton based paper (Cotton was plentiful in the victorian age due to the mills here in the North) I think that books which were intended to last a long time (For example Cookery Books or Encyclopaedias) were always made from Cotton based paper,India Paper which was made from Hemp was common in Miniature Bibles,smaller academic works and Novels.</p>

<dd>At first wood pulp paper was used for economy only, just as you say. But during the course of the century it began being used for more important works, in the UK US and Europe.

<dd>I liked your new book sculpture image (even though books were not labeled on the spine 500 years ago). The literature template never did much for me; its image is just a jumble, too small to see what it's trying to portray. And its navigation content seems largely irrelevant to the topic. Maybe it would be OK at the end. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 17:31, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK. I did remove this image but I have nothing (much) against the Walk of Ideas if this would find support. I like the template more as this connects the book with literature (book is - historically - primarily about content). Beginning the book article with a monument to <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutenberg.html" title="Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a> is in some ways appropriate, but I feel that the _idea_ of book much predates Gutenberg. Furthermore there (on the monument) are authors who are relatively modern. If the article has to begin with some illustrative image, then I would suggest something historically more significant than 18th-20th century German authors (e.g. <a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>). But I understand the pointer to modernity, metal, computers etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The thing I have more against is the rearrangement of pictures in the article. The alignment to the right was my opinion in agreement with (conservative) book design standards. Though the mixed alignment may "liven up" the page it gives it also a sloppy appearance. Usually the book is designed to have illustrative element (through a page) on the same side for continuous reading of the text - if the eye has to hop too much it gives the whole text frantic feel. Though I understand this may be in agreement with the modernity (as above).

<dd>Yes, thank you for the comments. As to books predating German writers, yes I agree (the first <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papyrus.html" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a> bound with string could be an option); but on the utility side of things, the first image has to visually catchy, i.e. we want to draw readers into the article so they are stimulated to read it. I put the "literature" template in the "see also" section. As to image position in online <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedias</a>, the preferred method is to alternate (#1); center (#2); right adjust (#3). Most <a href="../../../f/e/a/Featured_article.html" title="Featured article">featured articles</a> are like this, e.g. see <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photon</a>.

<dd>Maybe it is suitable for <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html#Overuse" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a>, but even there most of the pictures in the same section are uniformly aligned. And i have a feeling that the idea in wikipedia having the normal thumb size of 180px is for some reason and other sizes are in special circumstances only. I have somehow formed the opinion that this is for the ease of displaying pictures and for them to look similar. Having illustrations of different sizes (as in caffeine) displayed all over the page is usually - in book design - considered bad style. → <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAethralis_35c5.html" title="User:Aethralis">Aethralis</a> 12:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I have most of my experience in book design (mostly history of "book design", pre-Gutenbergian period) and do consider myself only vaguely familiar with web design. But I understand that through history images have posed a problem to "book designer". If images exist there (on the page) in their own right and the page is as much an image as a carrier of the text, the layout can be (and usually is) "creative". But in such towards written information and legibility orientated enterprises as wikipedia this is not a sensible approach. Furthermore, the images are only thumbs (pointers) and only full size image gives the full impression. So I see no particular reason for playing around with incomplete images what serve only as reference marks. → <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAethralis_35c5.html" title="User:Aethralis">Aethralis</a> 15:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is very useful, &amp; should be included, but it should be treated as a modern industry standard - many historical books were shorter than this &amp; I would not want them not counted as books just because of this (for example C15 "block-books" (see <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodblock_printing.html" title="Woodblock printing">Woodblock printing</a>) were mostly shorter than this. I'm not aware this is an issue in the current article text, btw - this is just in case it became one. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 18:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think this editing tool is good in a way. Because, well i know this is for people to contribute but I don't think it's appropriate. Some people might use it for writing false things or lies about the topic instead of contributing their knowledge of books. So do you think how could we restrain people from doing that because it is horrible doing that type of stuff. Please help me. Thank you, from your friend -- 23:18, 5 January 2007 User:Guppy663.</p>

<dd>I did this actually. And the following definitions came up <i>1.a book, esp. a very heavy, large, or learned book. 2.a volume forming a part of a larger work.</i> <b>Tome does not mean the same as book.</b> The words are not interchangable. Every tome is a book, but not every book is a tome. Sorry for trying to help. Maybe etymology isn't something that would be covered by an encyclopedia afterall. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">User:VeriGGlater</a> 07:49, 1 March 2007 (UTC) 01:50 01 March 2007</dd>

<ul>
<li>The point is, that there's too much similarity to warrant its own article. All that an article on tome could say is that it's heavier and larger than a regular book, but that can be covered in the book article too, where it is put into context. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:21, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps "tome", a large learned book or a volume forming a larger work, could be added to the entry, since "tome" does send to book and it is a specific type and a word cannot replace the word "book" wherever "book" appears. It might be a synonymous, but it does not share the exact meaning. A pocket sized paper back is not a "tome". Sorry, btw for the other stuff before. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">User:VeriGGlater</a> 03:21, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Exactly, which is why I was questioning why it was not under book. All tomes may be books, but all books are not tomes. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">User:VeriGGlater</a> 10:10 10 March 2007</li>

<dd>The are numerous references of course (eg. D. H. Wright, "The Tablets from Springmount Bog, a Key to Early Irish Palaeography", <i>The American Journal of Archaeology 67</i> (1963); R.Büll, "Wachs als Beschreib- und Siegelstoff - Wachsschreibtafeln und ihre Verwendung," Das große Buch vom Wachs, 2 vols, edd. R.Büll, E.Moser &amp; H.Kühn (München 1977).) The use of wax tablets in schools is well attested and in taking notes and doing business tablets were the normal writing material. → <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAethralis_35c5.html" title="User:Aethralis">Aethralis</a> 21:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
