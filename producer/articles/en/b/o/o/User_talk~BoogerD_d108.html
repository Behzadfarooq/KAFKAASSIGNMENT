<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Batvfd.jpg</b>.

When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
