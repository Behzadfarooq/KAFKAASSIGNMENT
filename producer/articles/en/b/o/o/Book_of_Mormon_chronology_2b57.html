<li>AD 34, the fourth day of the first month: Great and terrible destruction occurs -- "The face of the whole earth became deformed" (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/3_Nephi#8:17" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/3_Nephi">3 Nephi 8:17</a>).

<li>As the people howl and mourn their great losses, a voice from heaven proclaims the destruction of numerous people and cities, because of their wickedness. The voice continues: "I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/3_Nephi#9:15" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/3_Nephi">3 Nephi 9:15</a>). He declares the fulfillment of the law of Moses and invites all men to repent and come unto Him.</li>
<li>The darkness disperses and the earthquakes and groanings from the earth cease.

<li>Christ institutes the sacrament and commands them to pray. He ascends into heaven.</li>
<li>The people disperse to their homes and word goes out that Christ will appear again tomorrow. Those further away "labor exceedingly all that night" to be at the place where Christ will appear.</li>
<li>The next day, the twelve disciples divide the multitude into twelve groups and rehearse to them the words of Christ. They invite them to pray for the Holy Ghost and all are baptized by the twelve disciples. They are encircled with fire and angels minister to them.</li>

<li>Christ speaks of the last days and of the gathering of Israel. He recites the prophecies of Isaiah and Malachi.</li>

<li>Between AD 401 and 421: Moroni finishes his father's work (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Mormon#8" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/Mormon">Mormon 8</a>); abridges the book of Ether, the record of the Jaredites; and finishes with his own book, including the church ordinances (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Moroni#2" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/Moroni">Moroni 2-6</a>) and some of his father's teachings and writings (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Moroni#7" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/Moroni">Moroni 7</a>, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Moroni#8" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/Moroni">8</a>, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Moroni#9" class="extiw" title="s:Book_of_Mormon/Moroni">9</a>).</li>
<li>About AD 421: Moroni finishes the work his father and ancestors started, leaving a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroni%27s_Promise_ce83.html" title="Moroni's Promise">promise</a> to its readers, and buries it in the earth. After that, once the plates are safely buried and hidden, he then goes and gets in a fight with a small band of Lamanites, and is slain.</li>
