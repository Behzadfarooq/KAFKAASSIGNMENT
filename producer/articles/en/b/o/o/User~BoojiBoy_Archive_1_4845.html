<p>I have changed some of the content back; it was my mistake forgetting about Cornwall. The paragraph you quote is grammatically poor - "league of all but one Quebec teams" is awkward. I deleted the "disastrous" 2004 Draft reference because it is now nearly two years in the past, plus it sounds like WHL-cheering.

<p>In the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Knights_3f4b.html" title="London Knights">London Knights</a> article you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>London is also ranked third (behind Peterborough and Oshawa) on the all-time list of number of players drafted by the NHL, with 137 as of 2005.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since the NHL Draft was instituted in 1963, and the London Knights have existed since in 1968, I would assume their NHL alumni were drafted, unless signed as free agents. Is your number of 137 strictly drafted players, or total NHL Alumni?</p>
<p>If you are counting drafted players, then totals for all OHL teams that existed prior to 1963 would have to be adjusted. If you are counting total NHL Alumni, the OHL team with the most was actually the Toronto Marlboros with 202, then Peterborough (approx 185) &amp; Oshawa (approx 170). Let me know.

<dd>Flibirigit asked me to come on here and sate where I got my numbers. The chart was there before I came along, I just updated it up to the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. I got the figures from the NHL Official Guide &amp; Record Book. Those numbers are for the team the player was with when they were drafted, not how many alumni are from each team. So a player like <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Stuart_4714.html" title="Brad Stuart">Brad Stuart</a>, was drafted while he played for the Regina Pats, but he later played for the Calgary Hitmen. The Regina Pats are the team that gets the one, and the Calgary Hitmen don't get any as Stuart was not drafted with them. Similarly, a player like Jason Spezza who played with Brampton, and Mississauga then was traded to Windsor then was drafted, Windsor would get the credit for Spezza being on them when he was drafted. These figures also only stretch back to 1969, because the drafts from 1963-68 were not complete drafts, because many young players were still in possession of certain teams by signing a C-form when they were 18. Those drafts were only for young players who had never signed a C-form with any NHL club, thus numbers from those don't count towards the totals in that chart either. If you are looking for total NHL alumni of those teams, their are categories made out for each of those individual teams (see <a href="../../../k/i/t/Category%7EKitchener_Rangers_alumni_e067.html" title="Category:Kitchener Rangers alumni">Category:Kitchener Rangers alumni</a>).

<li>That's how I would have figured it out too and I believe my notation on the Knights' article reflects that. Obviously those numbers can be copied into the articles of other long-standing franchises as well - but being a Knights' fan I tend to search out most of my info on that team. It's an interesting list as well and I think it shows how the OHL has historically been the richest vein of talent for the NHL. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 17:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>Whoa, whoa, whoa... your a Knights fan? Oh then as a Rangers fan you are my sworn enemy... just kidding. But to make it more specific, I think it shows how the Kitchener Rangers has historically been the richest vein of talent for the NHL. I can tell you this, i don't care what the Knights record was in 2004-05, the 2002-03 Rangers team was better, and I can argue it to the death (i think).</dd>
</dl>
<p>All fake hostilities aside, I do agree with you that the OHL continues to be great (as do the WHL and QMJHL) in providing top-notch NHL talent. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Croatia.svg_6862.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1b/Flag_of_Croatia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Croatia.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Croatia.svg_6862.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/20px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 03:46, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Rangers have been the richest vein? How do you figure? We have one more draftee in two fewer years. In actuality I think it's the Peterborough Petes, and I don't really think that point is arguable. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 03:48, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I can agree with you on that, however recently, it could very well be the Rangers. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Croatia.svg_6862.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1b/Flag_of_Croatia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Croatia.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Croatia.svg_6862.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/20px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 03:55, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Could be. The Rangers historically haven't been a fantastic team though, and it was only this season that their all-time record climbed over .500. Apart from the early 80's and recently they were more an also-ran. The Knights on the other hand have a much better all-time record, but only 1 Memorial Cup and 1 OHL title compared to your 2 and 3. So in conclusion, we hate each other.&#160;:P <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 04:03, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey oh, I'm kicking away as part of the clean up project... I'm kinda the Junior Hockey (Sub-CHL) grunt worker... but your help is always appreciated. I'm saddened by this situation... and I think that the "copyright law" is being exaggerated... especially considering I have been in personal communication with the leagues and all that have written back are happy with our work and are willing to provide us with a lot of info... example: the OPJHL just gave me their stats back to 1979... but whatever... I say let's get them out of our hair while we can. Worse things could happen. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 03:19, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with someone cleaning up pages to conform to copyright law, but information was being lost due to carelessness and if you check his talk page he appears to have a long history of high-handedness. I have no problem cleaning up pages where the logos don't belong but there is no justification for removing logos from (e.g.) the SJHL page when most of the teams don't have their own articles. I'll keep reverting as long as I have to as long as information is being lost due to carelessness; the onus is on him to clean up responsibly or not at all. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 03:26, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Completely agree... it's sad though... two months ago we had someone chewing saying we shouldn't have team stubs because all the info should be on the league pages... now someone wants us to cut back on the league page info. So... I have a million and a quarter stubs to make it seems... I am doing the Maritime Jr. A league right now... but I was hoping that these leagues where I know nothing of their history could have been worked by that league's fans before I ever had to do this for them. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 03:53, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've edited the article to reflect the fact that the Steelback Centre naming deal <i>exists</i>, while noting that it still has to be approved by city council before the name becomes official.

<p>The Chiefs have a long, long history in Chilliwack and I thought it was worth preserving, especially since most of the Langley article had nothing to do with Langley. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 23:37, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well if you are going to do that... you should make both articles a little more cohesive... By killing the Chiliwack history in the Langley article... you've made it rather... empty... soulless. Maybe you could beef up the Langley article with an abridged history....&#160;??? and I'm not a fan of a 40 year old team not having any stats on their current page... I understand why you moved them... but they are still the same team... and the current article makes Langley look like an expansion team... which we both is not true. I don't know, it just needs a lot of work. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 23:56, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I will leave it at your discretion since you're the junior A expert here. I just thought that a blanket move of the article to Langley was a bad move since that history isn't Langley's. Most moved teams in major junior and the pros have their own articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 00:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I know what you mean. The problem is, especially in wikipedia... it can sometimes be a hard sell to the "minimalists" why every team should have its own page. Many minimalists contend that team articles should be sub-articles in the league's article. I whole-heartedly disagree with that assessment and have argued with a few people about it. A lot of people don't like our hockey-related stubs either... I've had to battle against a few AFD's in the last month... and the worst part is, I had to create all the stubs because of that anti-logo nazi that bothered us last month. I have been neck deep in editting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bottom line is that you need to realize that because they moved to Langley... it doesn't mean Langley now owns their history.... that aspect doesn't belong to the town... it belongs to the franchise. Sadly, the WHL chased the team out of town... which I've seen is a sad habit of theirs. I don't mind if the articles are separated... but that means we should end up doing that for all 142 teams across the CJAHL... which is about 600 different team names. We would also have to do it for about 80 defunct teams... and the problem is... I can't even find people to help me with the history of the LHJAAAQ or the MJAHL... and the articles for the SJHL and MJHL are crap... I think we need to build up the other leagues before focusing on that level of detail... like... I just brought the OPJHL up to an alright level of information... but the teams still have no history added to them... same with the SIJHL, NOJHL, and CJHL...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, Paulywog and I brought the BCHL up to a standard that the rest of the CJAHL needs to follow. If we set that bar any higher right now... it may be overly disproportionate compared to let's say the very incomplete MJAHL. I would love some help... especially finding info... but... it seems that the only effort being put in (by anyone other than me) is in the BCHL and AJHL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All-in-all... as long as the Chiliwack Chiefs article does not count as a defunct team, and IS counted as a part of the Langley franchise... I don't mind... but those two articles NEED to have better cohesion and the Langley article NEEDS it's stats and at least some franchise history (which it doesn't at this moment). But if this is going to be a trend with BCHL teams... I'm going to need people to start helping me with the leagues east of Alberta. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 00:23, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I know you were doing some acronym stuff for the categories... but you just about gave me a heart attack... I just did about 120 hrs worth of stats on that league, easy, and I come online today... look at my watchlist and see "Articles for Deletion"... I thought doomsday had come and the deletionists had finally come to kill all my hard work... either way... a little bit of warning wouldn't have hurt... lol. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 17:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the 'Star... I noticed the notice on the cat page... lol... but I woke up this morning for work... took one look at my watchlist and I didn't put 2 and 2 together... I thought I was going to die... I then clued in. Either way... a mass AFD has been one of the things I've been fearing the most as I build up Ontario hockey and I thought the nightmare was coming true... I'm glad that it only took me about 12 seconds to figure out what was going on... but... oh boy... was scared for a second. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 02:45, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, we can discuss it.
