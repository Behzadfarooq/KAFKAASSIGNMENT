<p>the organized labor project seems to be running smoothly, and I've started a new wikiproject, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pipe_Bands_8b60.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pipe Bands">Wikipedia:WikiProject Pipe Bands</a> to deal with the mostly sub standard wikipedia articles concerning <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_bands.html" title="Pipe bands">pipe bands</a>.

<p>I disagree that <a href="../../../c/n/v/CNV_Public_b9e0.html" title="CNV Public">CNV Public</a> needs a separate article. This is because it is only an affialite union of a larger organization. In the public space (the news, academia etc) the large federations are the point of reference, while the smaller affiliate unions are overlooked. This can bee seen at the Dutch wiki of CNV (even if you don't speak dutch). At the Dutch page on <a href="../../../../nl/c/h/r/Christelijk_Nationaal_Vakverbond_6c48.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Christelijk_Nationaal_Vakverbond">CNV</a>. All affiliate unions (except for CNV jong, which has received some press recently as innovation within the CNV) are red links. Furthermore in the Netherlands talks between the top of the government, employers organizations, and the unions (i.e. the federations) are very important. In my dutch perspective CNV public does not merit an own page, and we should concentrate on expanding CNV. --<a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 14:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your examples are from English speaking countries, that is not only logical from a linguistic perspective, but furthermore compared to dutch unions unions in anglosaxon countries tend to be weak and decentralized. From the Dutch perspective CNV public appears a very redundant article. --<a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 15:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The entry on <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Sylvestre-Williams_ec55.html" title="Henry Sylvestre-Williams">Henry Sylvestre-Williams</a> has him in the category of a Trinidad and Tobago trade unionists but on reading the entry this does not seem to be his main claim to fame. In fact, apart from noting that he was a member of the teachers union, there is nothing to suggest his was an activst trade unionist - in fact, on the contrary, much of what is said about him would seem to give him a very conservative agenda. I would think he should be taken out of this category.

<dd>You can start by just leaving a note on the talk page of the project. (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Organized_Labour_8446.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Organized Labour">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Organized Labour</a>) Outline what you're thinking, and see what others think. Be prepared to wait a few days for responses though, people tend to be a bit slow to get involved in group conversations here. (unlike myself, who's more likely just to barge in and say something!). BTW, one small point - when you leave a note on a talk page (like you did on mine), sign your name by using four tildes (~~~~). That way it automatically produces a link back to your page when you save the page.

<p>Hi Chris - I agree: the sooner this is sorted out, the better. I've closed the current debate and invite you to reopen it as you suggested.</p>
<p>I would suggest (and <i>will</i> suggest at SFD once debate is reopened) that, since the parent category is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETrade_unions_c3fc.html" title="Category:Trade unions">Cat:Trade unions</a>, it would make a lot of sense for all the stub templates and categories to be named that way too ({{<a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-trade-union-stub_d96b.html" title="Template:US-trade-union-stub">US-trade-union-stub</a>}} → Cat:Unied States trade union stubs, +c). The use of the word "union" can be a little ambiguous, but "trade union" is pretty well defined, so it shouldn't be a problem. It also avoids the messy labor/labour problem and the political overtones of the word "worker". That said, I don't have any problem with {{<a href="../../../w/o/r/Template%7EWorker-activist-stub_989a.html" title="Template:Worker-activist-stub">worker-activist-stub</a>}}, since if someone is active within the labo(u)r movement they already are in a political role, and the scope of the category with this name makes it slightly wider, including also people who aren't strictly speaking unionists. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Tom. <a href="../../../w/e/l/WP%7EWELCOME_0c24.html" title="WP:WELCOME">Welcome</a> to Wikipedia. Thanks for your note about <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centralia_Massacre_%28Washington%29_058f.html" title="Centralia Massacre (Washington)">Centralia Massacre (Washington)</a>. It would be great if you were interested in contributing to (and correcting) the article. The interesting thing about Wikipedia is that you already have all the tools you need for editing right in front of you. On the article page you simply click on the edit button - this will bring up the text of the document, and you are able to make the changes you feel are appropriate. For more detailed instructions about editing you can follow this link to the <a href="../../../w/e/l/WP%7EWELCOME_0c24.html" title="WP:WELCOME">welcome page</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer what I think is your real question - there is no central authority you need to contact to make your changes. For both better and worse, your edits will be reviewed by others (such as myself) who keep an eye on labour related articles. If you are comfortable with revealing some information about yourself you may want to leave a short note on the discussion page of the article (<a href="../../../c/e/n/Talk%7ECentralia_Massacre_%28Washington%29_2dff.html" title="Talk:Centralia Massacre (Washington)">Talk:Centralia Massacre (Washington)</a> outlining some of your changes, and perhaps more importantly, the fact that you have legitimate expertise in the subject area. Also, just as a warning, there are occasions when people who perhaps do not know a topic as well as they think they do, may alter information which you believe is correct. This may also happen for political purposes (and sometimes simply to make trouble!). I wouldn't expect this particular topic to be terribly controversial, I just wanted to mention the possibility so you know the environment you are working in.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your interest in helping out Tom. Be careful... it always starts with just one edit, and before you know it you're addicted to Wikipedia like the rest of us! Don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of any help. Cheers.

I created the article as part of a larger project with <a href="../../../u/n/i/WP%7EUNION_76bd.html" title="WP:UNION">WikiProject Organized Labour</a> to start articles about all the major unions/labour organizations around the world - so I don't have any particular expertise concerning Batay Ouvriye. The reason I named it as the <i>Workers' Fight Federation</i> is simply because that is the translation in the source I used: <i>Trade Unions of the World</i> published by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Centre_for_Trade_Union_Rights_e62d.html" title="International Centre for Trade Union Rights">International Centre for Trade Union Rights</a>. I'm not opposed to changing the name if <i>Struggle</i> is a better translation than <i>fight</i>, but I would also be interested in knowing how the organization itself has translated their name. Sometimes the translation is not the most accurate, but is nonetheless the official translation.

<p>Hi Bookandcoffee,</p>
<p>I'm writing you, because you created the article <a href="../../../g/e/w/Gewerkschaft_der_Polizei_8e8d.html" title="Gewerkschaft der Polizei">Gewerkschaft der Polizei</a>. I have just expanded it a bit by translating content from the German page. I am now considering moving the article to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_of_the_Police_ba82.html" title="Trade Union of the Police">Trade Union of the Police</a>, which is the direct translation of the German name.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> states "If a native spelling uses different letters than the most common English spelling (eg, Wien vs. Vienna), only use the native spelling as an article title if it is more commonly used in English than the anglicized form.".</p>
<p>If one googles the words "Gewerkschaft der Polizei" limiting the search to just English pages one definately gets more hits (even if one doesn't count the vast majority, which are German sites) than with "Trade Union of the Police". (The other possible translation "Labo(u)r Union of the Police" does not get any hits related to the union in question, so we can pretty much disregard this one).</p>
<p>But I did find one academic paper (<a href="http://www.rosalux.de/cms/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Reissig_PDSBerlin_e.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rosalux.de/cms/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Reissig_PDSBerlin_e.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and a government document (<a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:yTSxawpM0kQJ:doku.iab.de/externe/2006/k060907f17.pdf+%22Trade+Union+of+the+Police%22&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:yTSxawpM0kQJ:doku.iab.de/externe/2006/k060907f17.pdf+%22Trade+Union+of+the+Police%22&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), which both used the translation "Trade Union of the Police".</p>
<p>I also found a few other translations such as "Union of Policemen" and "German Police Union", but I don't like them, because they're very imprecise. I'm leaning towards translating the title rather than leaving it in German, but I want to ask you, what your opinion is first.</p>

<dd>Hi Carabinieri. I'm certainly OK with the idea of moving this to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_of_the_Police_ba82.html" title="Trade Union of the Police">Trade Union of the Police</a>. I'll defer to your opinion about which translation is best, (given I don't speak German&#160;:). I would note that "German Police Union" actually sounds like a union name, as opposed to a literal translation, but your logic makes sense to me.</dd>

<dd>The source I used for starting many of these articles often had both the native language name and a translation - but the translations for the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions_2989.html" title="German Confederation of Trade Unions">DGB</a> were clearly imprecise descriptions rather than true names. (eg. <a href="../../../g/e/w/GEW_d906.html" title="GEW">GEW</a> was just <i>education and science</i>), so I stuck with the original names.</dd>

<dd>I think I will move the article. I would probably move <a href="../../../i/g/_/IG_Metall_1528.html" title="IG Metall">IG Metall</a>, but "German Metalworkers' Union" is clearly not a good translation; I would prefer "Industrial Union Metal" or something like that. I don't think it's necessary to move ver.di, because it's almost always refered to by this abbreviation, rather than by "Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft", so I think the way the article describes the name right now is ok.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a><a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarabinieri_f294.html" title="User talk:Carabinieri"><sup>T</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>a</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>l</sub><sup>k</sup><sub>k</sub></a> 15:45, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I went and looked closely at their web site. They do say 'workers fight'. Hm. Ok, that is what they want it to be I guess. I lived in Haiti for four years so I know a little about them, but have never actually met any of them. Jdlyall 07:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Merhawie. Thanks for your note. I added the word because the NCEW is a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_trade_union_center.html" title="National trade union center">national trade union center</a>, not just a single trade union. Here's a description from <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTUR_0276.html" title="ICTUR">ICTUR</a>.
<blockquote>
<p>"The NCEW is now reported to be independent of the government and the PFDL. It comprises some 250 unions and five federations, the largest being the Textile, Leather and Shoe Federation."</p>

<p>It looks good. I've removed the other part as I don't think this is productive at the moment, swimming before walking and all that. The sub page idea is interesting. Although, it could be easily made as a template too. I'm not sure which would be better. I think the summary articles are a great opportunity and a great way to go. As is having a sane system of templates and categorisation (which we have).</p>
<p>I don't think having sub-sub-pages is a good idea, but rather in some central location we should have just a list of languages and summaries. Don't ask me how this would work yet though. It is good to keep them together in one place I think.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about how to deal with the issue of proper names. It seems many a time these are many up of similar elements, e.g. "national federation", "union of journalists" etc. But there is no water-tight naming scheme for each country. I'm of two minds. 1) It might be possible to "translate the names" -- e.g. give translations for words, then put them together. 2) It might be just as quick to find translations for each name individually. How many are there? 1000? A table could be effected with names in rows and languages in columns. We would need to compile a list of names at any rate in order to make the stub articles (even without translated proper names). - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 02:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think having /Summary would be good. We can have each translation in a separate section, keyed with language code. We can also have a central list at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Organized_Labour_Summaries_abd9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Organized Labour/Summaries">Wikipedia:WikiProject Organized Labour/Summaries</a> with all the articles which have these summaries.</dd>

<dd>I have procured Tajik, Urdu and Macedonian translations so far for the infobox based thing. Do you know if <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_trade_unions.html" title="List of trade unions">List of trade unions</a> is complete, or even almost complete. I'd like to try and get people started on translating the names. I can write a script to turn a list into a table no problem. But it would be best if we can have a full list&#160;:) I think the table should be structured something like:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
! Native name || English name || English country name || Tajik name || Urdu name || Macedonian name || ... 
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>It is quite straight forward to do a search/replace on country name, at least for Tajik and Macedonian. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 18:06, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately yes, some double translation will be in order. I think it is worth it in the long term though, it isn't entirely necessary to have native name for all of them, but it is desirable. I will see if I can find a comprehensive list of trade unions somewhere on the web that I can import in. I'll probably start by looking on the TUC site or something. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 18:41, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I see you rated the above article for the organized labour wikiproject.</p>
<p>As the person responsible for most of the content, I'd be interested in hearing your rationale for the rating and any comments about how the article might be improved.

<dd>Thanks for that, I'm actually more interested in improving the article itself than upping its rating but I doubt if I'll have time any time soon, and anyway I'm less and less convinced that time spent on Wikipedia is useful - not that I want to discourage you or anything, I see you have been doing sterling work. But James Larkin is a bit of a pet article of mine as it was basically the one that brought me into wikipedia (perhaps i should be cursing his revered memory!).

<p>Hey Chris. Thanks for the welcome. Considering that there seems to a relatively high labour consciousness in BC, it's not adequately reflected on Wikipedia (yet). There also seems to be an obsession with local history in Vancouver and trying to agree on an identity for the city, so its not too surprising to find more than one other Vancouverite in the labour field.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 17:36, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering when an article ceased to be a stub. For instance, the original article on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Manswell_6b50.html" title="James Manswell">James Manswell</a> was really just a holding page and clearly a stub. But, whilst recoghnising that any article is capable of being expanded and improved, does the major re-write that I did make it now not a stub?

<dd>Yeah, that's a perennial question around here. In my opinion, people tend to leave stub tags on articles longer than necessary. I think they're afraid that they're making too strong of an statement that the article is "finished" in some way if they remove the tag. I would agree that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Manswell_6b50.html" title="James Manswell">James Manswell</a> isn't a stub anymore.
