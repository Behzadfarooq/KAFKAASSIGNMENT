	    <p>My first action on Wikipedia was to edit the History section to reflect the current numbers of Bookcrossers and books. The figures were over two months old! May I suggest that someone checks the Bookcrossing site on a regular basis (say, the first of each month) and updates the numbers.

<p>Hi there. I've made a number of changes to the second half of the article that I hope people approve of. I've added more about inter-BCer communication and books travelling between members as I felt before the emphasis was pretty much on wild releasing, whilst many people get many of their books from other BCers. I've also added a section on the controversy over BC - I thought that might be interesting - and I've added a couple of links that I think are relevant to the bottom of the article. <a href="../../../d/u/p/User%7EDupont_Circle_b924.html" title="User:Dupont Circle">Dupont Circle</a> 21:40, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"BookCrossing, BC, BCing, or BXing, is defined as the practice of leaving ("releasing") a book in a public place ("the wild") to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise. The analogy is with the ornithological practice of ringing birds to track their movements.</i></p>
<p><i>There are no charges for participation but donations to keep the Web site going can be made..."</i></p>
<p>First section is fine, but the next paragraph does not fit into this - it has to be rewritten and properly explained. My personal opinion is that on should not mention "<i>the</i> Web site" when this something that actually is not limitted to this single web site (since when did that site "own" BC?). the bookcrossing.com site should be mentioned later, and of course in the history section if that is the site that started it.

<dd>The name came from the site. There are no references to BookCrossing prior to the site's establishment. BookCrossing depends on a BCID registration number, and there were no sites offering a database of book IDs for this purpose prior to the establishment of BookCrossing.com --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESurgeonsmate_83c2.html" title="User:Surgeonsmate">Surgeonsmate</a> 11:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, you say it is impossible to do anything similar to bookcrossing without registrating on that page? but if it is, what is the name of the idea that is hidden behind the "trademark" of Bookcrossing? Is this activity entirely dependent upon the possibility to track the book around the world? The idea/activity is, in the first paragraph, described as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do the likewise" - you should then rewrite this paragraph, so that it actually says what you are saying. <a href="../../../e/h/j/User%7EEhjort_1bcc.html" title="User:Ehjort">Ehjort</a> 19:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course you can do something similar. But leaving computer-registered books around for others to find was unknown before BookCrossing.com. The definition comes from the Oxford English Dictionary, which included this some years <b>after</b> the establishment of BookCrossing.com. Don't read too much into the Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESurgeonsmate_83c2.html" title="User:Surgeonsmate">Surgeonsmate</a> 01:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your answer. Seems we agree on the topic; but I say a little rewriting is necessary - BCing is not just the practice of leaving books in public places (...) (though it is, according to both me and the dictionary), it is the practice of leaving a book in a public place <b>and</b> registering it on the web site. <a href="../../../e/h/j/User%7EEhjort_1bcc.html" title="User:Ehjort">Ehjort</a> 07:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would you all agree that my own version of the intro is somewhat an improvement? For instance, I made sure to note both the meaning of the term AND its origin in the opening sentence, as well as defining a directly-derived term that was used later in the article, and nixed the list of ways in which the project can be funded by user donations (it made it sound like an advertisement as opposed to a neutral article. Simply mentioning that it gets its funding from a combination of user donations and advertizing is enough, as far as I'm concerned; if someone actually <i>does</i> want to donate to the project, they can always go to the website itself and do so, which if they're honestly wondering what payment methods for donations the website accepts, is what they're probably thinking of to begin with). <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 22:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>In the first section, it's claimed that Ron came up with the idea because of currency tracking. However, later in the article it says that PhotoTag is the idea on which it is based. Anyone have any clarification on this issue? Which is correct?

<dd>I tried to get around this issue, I think by saying that Where's George was sometimes said to have inspired it (which is said on the WG article), but I have to admit - PhotoTag does not appear to be notable, as it was a redlink, so I removed it. It's possible the link was wrong, and it's possible that the site is actually notable and just doesn't have an article yet, and it's possible it did inspire BookCrossing. If so, please feel free to revert my changes, but just make sure to clarify (both here and on the <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where%27s_George__4e8c.html" title="Where's George?">Where's George?</a> article) which site really did inspire BookCrossing. In the meantime, if PhotoTag is notable (whether on its own or by proxy due to having inspired the creation of BookCrossing), I suggest somebody create an article on it.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 22:46, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>In 2001, Ron Hornbaker and his wife noticed the popularity of <b>websites such as PhotoTag and Where's George? which track the journeys of various items - in these examples, disposable cameras and American banknotes respectively - as different people use them.</b> It set Ron wondering about what else people might want to track, and he hit upon the idea of some sort of system for tracking who had read a particular book. After establishing that neither the idea of tracking books, nor the name 'bookcrossing', were yet to be found on the Internet, he set about establishing his own website.</i></dd>

<p>Should rings, rays and boxes come under the 'furthering the BC idea' rather than in the same section as catches and releases?

<p>Perhaps a controversial move, but I've taken out the paragraph about Jim Hawkins' radio show. I'm not convinced it's particularly important in the grand scheme of things. I'm sure the only non-BCers who listen to the show are those in Shropshire, and therefore it's only as important as any other regional media coverage? <a href="../../../d/u/p/User%7EDupont_Circle_b924.html" title="User:Dupont Circle">Dupont Circle</a> 19:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As an ongoing show, it is certainly of regional interest only, but it was the first radio show that had (still has) a regular BC feature, and has spawned numerous BC-related shows and activities on other regional BBC Radios. It certainly helped to make the concept of bookcrossing known to more people in the UK. I haven't heard of any such ongoing activities in other countries. Maybe the info could be included in a more general way (referencing BBC Radio Shropshire as the ones who started it)?--62.225.177.13 07:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
