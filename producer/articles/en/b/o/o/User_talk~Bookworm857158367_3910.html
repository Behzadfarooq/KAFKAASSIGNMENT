<p>Technically you can add the characters from <i>Lost</i> along with more updated programs on TV, I came across this hypothesis <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Westphall_8bd1.html" title="Tommy Westphall">Tommy Westphall</a> which explains the cross-over of a multitude of characters from different TV shows all thanks to ONE minor character in <i>St. Elsehwere</i>. For a clearer idea on how they link up check this diagram: <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers(full).jpg" class="external text" title="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers(full).jpg" rel="nofollow">crossover diagram</a> and this site: <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html" class="external text" title="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html" rel="nofollow">Tommy Westphall's Mind</a> - however I still think we should try to find correlations between the original Newtonverse families effected by the meteorite or related to them with the more current characters... <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 20:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah you're right they justify being added in, I had originally thought that there wasn't much purpose, but seeing as the Coles from 6th Sense have already been entered in it would make sense to follow suit, especially in the case of Signs. Feel free to add them in. (This is in regards to the inclusion of the characters from Signs). <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 22:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey just wanted to say good work on the List, thanks a lot with all the added research and effort. I'm still going at it hard trying to string the more "horror" -related characters into the family, but don't let it hold you back, you've truly made this list better from its earlier days. Keep it obscure! <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 00:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, just found this site - it's pretty helpful and has a huge compendium of international superheroes etc... from myths to TV and so on <a href="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.internationalhero.co.uk</a>, see if you can use it. Also can you look over any additions I've recently mad and see if they link up to anyone I missed? The list has gotten so huge it's difficult to correlate characters now, I added the Bond villains "Largo" - I believe they are somehow connected to the Luthors. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 22:13, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi sorry but I am currently away on work. But it is a shame the list was deleted. I do believe there need to be new re-administered ammendments to the list what with new information coming to light i.e the sopranos are not related to corleone familyand the other mistakes that were pointed out by other users in the deletion poll. I look forward to the list,s implementation on your page, i will be sure to contribute where i can. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a></p>

<dd><i>Four-year-old Allegra wrote her father a letter in Italian from the convent, dated September 21, 1821, asking him to visit her: "My dear Pappa. It being fair-time, I should like so much a visit from my Papa as I have many wishes to satisfy. Won't you come to please your Allegra who loves you so?" (Eisler 1999: 701)</i></dd>

<li>FOUR YEAR OLD?? My mother babysits a girl who is four years old. She can barely write sentences, let alone comprehend words such as "satisfy".

<p>Okay well I want to help you, so I'm going to look at the article in detail tomorrow. When I say wikify, I mean like compair your article to one that I've edited like <a href="../../../t/y/k/Tyke_%28elephant%29.html" title="Tyke (elephant)">Tyke (elephant)</a>. See how sections are used to seperate the incident. They're used the same way when adding sections to an individuals like...like say <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> - although I understand his is rather broad. See what I mean? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubbleboy_4a78.html" title="User:Stubbleboy">Stubbleboy</a> 00:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You were at that incident?! Wow, that is amazing. I actually started that article under my old username. I've been using Wikipedia for years now. I have a passion for elephants, and I honestly think that it is horrible how the circus treats them, especially in Tyke's situation. What did you think of the page? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubbleboy_4a78.html" title="User:Stubbleboy">Stubbleboy</a> 01:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hiya, I though I'd try to explain things here on your talkpage, in order to avoid future disputes. Please be aware that Wikipedia has very strict policies about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>, and it is not enough for you to simply say that "something is true", without supplying references. Also, when someone adds the {{<a href="../../../o/r/i/Template%7EOriginalresearch_ce39.html" title="Template:Originalresearch">originalresearch</a>}} tag to an article, the way to deal with it is to engage in a good faith discussion about it on the talkpage. If you have a solid case that the tag is unwarranted, this can be discussed in a calm and civil manner, and the tag can easily be removed once consensus has been confirmed. However, simply removing it yourself and saying that it is unfounded, especially as you're a (relatively) inexperienced editor, is not wise. There are many common mistakes that new Wikipedia editors fall into, and believe it or not, I'm actually trying to help you avoid them. For example, please be aware that each editor on Wikipedia has a voice, and when there is disagreement, the Wikipedia method of dealing with disputes is to engage in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> discussions, rather than for one editor to try and make unilateral decisions and or simply try to force their will on other editors. If you continue on the course that you have been, by refusing to engage in good faith discussions, the next step in dispute resolution will be to generate some type of informal or formal "Request for Comment", which draws in the opinions of other editors to examine a situation and offer third-party opinions. I'd rather avoid that at this point, since the impact on you and the articles that you have been editing might be more negative than you anticipate. So please, I recommend that you review the policy on <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, and endeavor to engage in constructive discussions, rather than proceeding down the path of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_wars_4216.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit wars">Wikipedia:Edit wars</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 16:41, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with you that minor criminals shouldn't get their own articles. It does seem to be the case, however, that Thompson has garnered significant media attention.

<p>I see that not only did you send me a message (unsigned), but you also managed to delete -- or arranged to have deleted -- the page on Anna Maria Ferrero in the space of a very short time. A little courtesy would have required that you allow me the opportunity to tag "hangon" onto the article and a little more time for the article to be fleshed out. One cannot always finish every article one begins within a few hours. FYI, and to quell your fears of non-notability, Anna Maria Ferrero is a very distinguished Italian stage actress and film star with 50+ films to her credit <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0274671/maindetails" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0274671/maindetails" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, has worked with some of the greatest Italian directors and frequently with Vittorio Gassoman, who was her companion.

I cannot tell when you deleted the article as it is no longer visible, but it had to be deleted before 23:30. So from posting message to deletion in less than 9 hours. How much time do you give us?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. If the criterion of notability is whether <i><b>you</b></i> have heard of someone, heaven help us all and Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also noticed from your recent history that your main contributions to Wikipedia seem to consist almost entirely of the speedy deletion of other people's work. Wikipedia's dictum of assuming "good faith" is becoming hard to observe in your case.</p>

<dd>I didn't delete your article. I'm not an administrator and don't have the ability to delete articles. An administrator apparently looked at the article and felt that it warranted speedy deletion. All I did was post a tag on the article and a warning message on your page, giving you an opportunity to put a hold on message on the article. As I recall, you said the woman was an actress. I would not have deleted it had you said, for instance, "She is notable for starring in a number of films. Will add the names later." Just saying she's an actress doesn't cut it and, frankly, not everyone is going to know who the subject of an article is. That's why you HAVE to put in the very first sentence, the first time you hit "enter," what she's notable for (or at the very least a bare-bones explanation.) If you didn't have time to do that, maybe you should have waited until you had time to write a more complete stub. I had no way of knowing what she was famous for and neither did the administrator who actually deleted the page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the other speedy deletion notices I've put, the vast majority of the articles appear to have been obscene or incoherent messages that any reasonable person would label "nonsense," one-line bios written by teenagers saying "so and so is handsome, sexy and cool," "a band that has no demo is cool," blatant ads advertising their company's page or MySpace site or attack pages, also by teenagers, saying "so and so is (unprintable.)" Every single one of those articles has to be vetted by an administrator before it is deleted and other people have an opportunity to object and remove the tag if they decide I'm wrong, as I notice they have done in some instances. That's fine and as it should be. I don't think that type of article belongs on Wikipedia. If your subject is as notable as you say she is, submit the article again and this time SAY what she did in the first line. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookworm857158367_aed8.html" title="User:Bookworm857158367">Bookworm857158367</a> 14:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, congratulations on a series of Good Articles. Well done! I have done all your assessment requests with Project Russia, and now have a request for you: please do not remove the current assessment ratings. They form a frame of reference for the reviewer, and the importance rating should not change when the article has been rewritten. Removing (importance) ratings only causes for more work to be done, and that's energy better spent elsewhere. Thanks for your cooperation. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Er</a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User_talk%7EErrabee_f6be.html" title="User talk:Errabee"><font color="orange">rab</font></a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">ee</a> 23:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your explanation about the Romanov servants. I had diffused hundreds of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_martyrs_a4db.html" title="Category:Christian martyrs">Category:Christian martyrs</a> into sub-categories over the last few months, but was not sure how to categorise the articles on the Romanov household. I looked up a few sources, in and outside Wikipedia, and none reported a distinction between the family and the servants, so I assumed that the servants were likewise Passion Bearers. Apologies if I missed something. The other reason for putting them all in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Category%7EPassion_bearers_4476.html" title="Category:Passion bearers">Category:Passion bearers</a> was that it kept them together.</p>
<p>One possibility now would be to categorise most of the servants as <a href="../../../o/r/t/Category%7EOrthodox_martyrs_of_Modern_Times_0684.html" title="Category:Orthodox martyrs of Modern Times">Category:Orthodox martyrs of Modern Times</a>, but Alexei Trupp as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category%7ECatholic_martyrs_of_Modern_Times_7e9e.html" title="Category:Catholic martyrs of Modern Times">Category:Catholic martyrs of Modern Times</a>. Another would be to keep them together in a new category e.g. "Canonised servants of the Romanov household", which could be placed as a sub-category of <a href="../../../o/r/t/Category%7EOrthodox_martyrs_of_Modern_Times_0684.html" title="Category:Orthodox martyrs of Modern Times">Category:Orthodox martyrs of Modern Times</a>. Would you support either of these, or suggest something different? - <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayenatic_london_2a35.html" title="User:Fayenatic london">Fayenatic london</a> <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayenatic_london_c2a4.html" title="User talk:Fayenatic london">(talk)</a> 09:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your prompt reply. I have based the categorisation of martyrs on the faith for which they died (i.e. the church that they belonged to when they died), rather than the church(es) that canonised them. Christian martyrdom is mainly about witnessing, rather than being a victim of a political or random murder; once someone has been canonised as a martyr, I'm not going to second-guess that decision, but it might help to have some separate categories.</dd>
<dd>As for the Romanov household, have I understood this correctly: the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia canonised both the family and the servants as martyrs; then the church in Russia declared the family to be Passion bearers, but made no declaration about the servants? - <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayenatic_london_2a35.html" title="User:Fayenatic london">Fayenatic london</a> <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayenatic_london_c2a4.html" title="User talk:Fayenatic london">(talk)</a> 22:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, thanks. If you have any new pages to add on martyrs and you're not sure which sub-cat to use, by all means put them in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_martyrs_a4db.html" title="Category:Christian martyrs">Category:Christian martyrs</a> and I'll move them down. May I also suggest that you use {{DEFAULTSORT:}} before the categories, as it means you only have to enter the sort key once, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Varvara_Yakovleva&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116783483" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Varvara_Yakovleva&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116783483" rel="nofollow">this example</a>. - <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayenatic_london_2a35.html" title="User:Fayenatic london">Fayenatic london</a> <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayenatic_london_c2a4.html" title="User talk:Fayenatic london">(talk)</a> 14:45, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
