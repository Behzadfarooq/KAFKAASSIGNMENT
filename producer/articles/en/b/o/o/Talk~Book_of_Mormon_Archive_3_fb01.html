<h2><span class="mw-headline">Style for article</span></h2>
<p>I checked out similar articles for Qur'an and Bible as well as the Sacred text article. Enlightening style guides. Good required reading for any would-be editors of this page. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 21:55, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found an article at the back of the LDS Church's current edition of the B of M that is titled "A Brief Explanation". Unlike the "Introduction" in that same edition, it is quite NPOV and might be an improvement on the pretty good article that is here. I may see whether it would be permissible to quote such a beast or use it here. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 22:53, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Separate Article for each Book</span></h2>
<p>Do we need a seperate article for each of the books in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a>? I think they should be merged into one article. <a href="../../../n/o/l/User%7ENoldoaran_2ce7.html" title="User:Noldoaran">Noldoaran</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/l/User_talk%7ENoldoaran_69c6.html" title="User talk:Noldoaran">Talk</a>)<a href="../../../%2C/_/_/%2C.html" title=",">,</a> 16:13, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a good suggestion. There are currently stub articles for all the books, but none of them contain much information. Unlike the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, there is not a great deal of independent historical or incidental information for each book. An article for a particular book would just amount to a summary of the text, which should be short enough to fit in one article. The historical, etc., information that would be of interest in an encyclopedia article would regard the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> as a whole.<a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN">COGDEN</a> 16:58, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. There is plenty of exegesis to be written for each book-article. If you remove them, they will eventually be spun off as the exegesis becomes to unwieldly for this article...but far be it from me to stop you guys on this one. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a> 17:18, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)

<dd>On second thought, I am ambivalent. In the short term, there is not much material on each individual book in the Book of Mormon, and a single article would be more coherent. On the other hand, in the long run, I think that <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">BoNoMoJo</a> is right that there will eventually be lots of exegesis, and a single article would become unwieldly. Maybe we should just leave things as they are. However, I think the articles should be called by the full name of the book, such as "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Book_of_Nephi_0e6b.html" title="Second Book of Nephi">Second Book of Nephi</a>", rather than "<a href="../../../2/_/n/2_Nephi_3c95.html" title="2 Nephi">2 Nephi</a>". I had already moved "<a href="../../../1/_/n/1_Nephi_f603.html" title="1 Nephi">1 Nephi</a>" to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Book_of_Nephi_b33c.html" title="First Book of Nephi">First Book of Nephi</a>.

<dd>I agree that there is room for growth and that there is little need to combine. Might check the treatment of other sacred texts in Wikipedia. Are most expanded by book? <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>?

<p>But the books of the BofM do not and never have stood alone. The Book of Mormon is a monolithic composition and never purported to be otherwise. From that POV, what sense does it make to arbitrarily assign an article to each sub-book just because it has a name? Is there any real difference between 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi or between 3 Nephi and 4 Nephi. Truly they are really just chapters in the long record. Does anybody really feel that The Book of Jacob ought to stand on its own any more than Isaiah Chapter 55? Even the 23rd Psalm doesn't have its own Wiki article. Why proliferate articles when there is already overwhelming work to be done on the existing ones? <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 18:29, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RE: Hidden Comments</span></h2>
<p>Hawstrom - To some of your hidden comments in the text: Yes the Book of Mormon is published by other churches besides the LDS Church. I also agree that it would be helpful to those eding this page if they read those other pages (<a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_Texts_041d.html" title="Sacred Texts">Sacred Texts</a>) prior to editing this page. If you'll notice though, these other pages have silenced any controversy that has been introduced about the sacred texts. Since they have a history of over a thousand years, they can squash it better than a sacred text that has only been around for 170+ years. I think they are missing a lot of information in not allowing the information to be included (or as seperate controversies articles), and the issue will certainly be introduced soon. May want to look at the discussion going on at <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EEloquence_b8a8.html#Book_of_Mormon_controversies" title="User talk:Eloquence">User talk:Eloquence#Book of Mormon controversies</a> regarding NPOV issues and overviews of sacred texts. I personally like this format and think it could solve issues that are occuring on other controversial sites. Part of the discussion states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The page gives (and should give) an overview of what it says it is (and to your point is not the exclusive domain of their believers - although wikipedians seem to be censoring those type of pages as a whole, which I can understand). I think MOST of the the controversies are better handled in another forum, allowing the main page to give an overview.... This would save a lot of problems on the Mother Teresa page if they left the page be a simple biographical sketch of her life and then had two other pages on achievements and controversies. It seems like a no-brainer to me, but in that article's case there isn't enough sense in the editors to realize this (because it is so heated, not that they aren't smart). I do think that more criticism needs to be added into other sacred texts articles, as the editors don't seem to allow outside opionion and controversy. I think the controversy article about the book of mormon is a very good start on a great thing. I think people can argue with content within articles about main subjects themselves, but they can't argue with a seperate controversies page.</dd>

They do not emphasize it as much as the LDS Church. I am however, unsure on what date the current edition was first printed. They may still use the 1908 edition which was put into verses, etc. But they definately publish the book (and incidentally, the Inspired Version (JST) of the bible). <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 07:13, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Non-neutrality</span></h2>
<p>The section headed with, "Consistency with Latter Day Saint doctrines after 1830" is typical anti-Mormon propaganda. It is a criticism of church’s non-adherence to Book of Mormon doctrine as the author interprets it, as well as criticism of doctrine that is not even contained in the Book of Mormon. This belongs on the Controversies regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints page, if anywhere. I am seriously considering disputing the neutrality of this page if this section remains. <a href="../../../r/s/d/User%7ERsduhamel_fe61.html" title="User:Rsduhamel">Rsduhamel</a> 06:55, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>That section was written by an LDS writer, COGDEN, trying to give a neutral historical POV. He is more liberal in his historical viewpoints than the other LDS editors on the page, but is not incorrect in his statements. Most of his edits seem to pull from fringe Mormon historians (by stating this I do not mean non-reputable, just most mainstream Mormon historians consider them on the edge in their assumptions or question their agenda like D. Michael Quinn), fairly new research, and connecting statements in isolated journals rather than the Journal Histories. Although I do not like the statements, they are factually correct. I think this is one thing that has led to other LDS editors taking a short sabbatical from major edits (see BoNOMoJo's user page). Nearly all of COGDEN's research is solid and you may want to look back at the archives of these and other Mormon pages as I've debated these and othter topics with him.</p>
<p>COGDEN, I hope no offence is taken, I'm just trying to give Rsduhamel my viewpoint on your edits. I've corrected the edits when I've been able to support my interpretation of Mormon history, but your writing is based on solid (and sometimes obscure) reseach, that can't be disputed. I guess it will all work out best in the end. I admire your non-apologetic neutrality, even if it seems contradictory to advice and direction given about Mormon historical research given by Elder Packer and others. The other benefit of your work is that it directly gives many answers to the Tanner's sloppy work. Keep up the good work, even if I don't neccessarily agree with your view of the more details the better. I do believe your edits are informative and much needed. I just wish it was in a Mormon wiki rather than in a general interest wiki.</p>
<p>On another note, Rsduhamel, please fill out your user page so we know a bit of your background and what you are working on. Also, when you are creating Mormonism or Latter Day Saint articles, please add them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_Mormonism_ad0b.html" title="List of articles about Mormonism">List of articles about Mormonism</a>. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 15:03, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In November the BofM page was a mess resembling a mudfight, and I did a major rework to try to discipline it. Part of what was there was the implied argument "And the Mormons don't really follow it anyway. It's just a bait and switch tool." I saw that argument as rather irrelevant to the BofM itself, and I still agree that it has more to do with the church than the Book. I believed that stating the argument explicitly would demonstrate its absurdity in a discussion of BofM. The danger at that time was in deleting wholesale all the arguments against the BofM on the page. Does that history help, and what do you think we should do? <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 04:43, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I apologize for not filling in my personal page yet. I will as soon as I can but that may not happen right away.</p>
<p>I hadn’t read the Book of Mormon page until a friend of mine brought it to my attention. This friend found the implication that Mormons may not really believe the B of M and the section on consistency offensive. I agree and tried to neutrally correct the misleading statement on "Latter Day Saint views." The section on consistency, I believe, belongs on the controversy page.</p>
<p>Let me make it clear, I am not disputing the accuracy of any of the statements in the consistency section. However, as I said above, it is typical anti-Mormon propaganda. Just look at Bill McKeever’s page titled, "Test Your Knowledge of the Book of Mormon" (<a href="http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/test.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/test.html</a>). It’s the same argument, i.e. “If the Book of Mormon is the most correct book on earth, then where are <b>all</b> your beliefs in the Book of Mormon?”</p>
<p>I would have no problem with a general statement to the effect that, "Joseph Smith stated that the Book of Mormon is the most correct book on earth. However, many LDS doctrines do not originate there. Some critics have also charged that certain church doctrines are inconsistent with principles in the Book of Mormon.". This would include a link to the controversies page. This is a statement of fact, not an editorial, and it shows the reader where to read more.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linguistics in BoM articles</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I've been the one who — over the past several months — has occasionally added <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_languages.html" title="Hebrew languages">Hebrew</a> forms of BoM names, though only where the linguistics behind a name are known. I was wondering — since <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> is also believed by LDS to be a contributing language to the BoM, would anyone here object if I added Arabic BoM forms to the various relevant articles? For instance, the official Arabic BoM has distinctive spellings for names such as Omni, Mosiah, Alma, Zarahemla, Helaman, etc. I thought it would be good detail. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 07:13, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is <b>عمني</b> <b>ʿUmnī</b>. Based on that and the BoM's transliteration <i>Omni</i> for the name, it would be reasonable to expect the logical <i>Tiberian</i> Hebrew form (the earliest Hebrew standard I can reasonably construct) to be <b>עמני</b> <b>ʿOmnî</b>. Of course the believed date of the Book of Mormon's beginning is c. 600 B.C., which predates <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberian_Hebrew_2f00.html" title="Tiberian Hebrew">Tiberian Hebrew</a> by approximately 1500 years.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category:Pseudohistory</span></h2>
<p>Why is this category inappropriate? Historians consider the book to be pseudohistory because it doesn't employ any standard method for discovering and documenting historical facts. Mormons may dispute whether it is pseudohistory, but holocaust deniers dispute the tag as well, just as creationists dispute the pseudoscience tag, but since their ideas do not follow an accepted method, and are not accepted by mainstream historians, that is irrelevant to whether we mention that they are considered to be pseudohistory.

<p>It shouldn't matter what secular historians think. In Wikipedia, secular views are just as valid as religious views, or even racist views. Categorizing the <i>Book of Mormon</i> under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudohistory_b53e.html" title="Category:Pseudohistory">Category:Pseudohistory</a> is in effect a non-NPOV argument that the Book of Mormon <i>is</i> pseudohistory. I think the problem is in the category name itself. I think it should be changed to something like Category:Nonstandard history. (Note that <a href="../../../a/l/t/Category%7EAlternate_history_c539.html" title="Category:Alternate history">Category:Alternate history</a> is already taken, and as defined, it is probably just as inappropriate a home for the Book of Mormon as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudohistory_b53e.html" title="Category:Pseudohistory">Category:Pseudohistory</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 21:47, Dec 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes it should matter what secular historians think. Defining something as pseudohistory does not neccesarily state that it is false, it states that it does not follow the standard method of discovering historical truth, something that applies to the Book of Mormon whether you consider it to be fact or not. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 22:02, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. The prefix <i>pseudo-</i> means <i>false</i> or <i>counterfeit</i>. Pseudohistory is false history, not merely controversial or nonstandard history. Besides there <i>is</i> no "standard method of discovering historical truth" that I am aware of, and upon which everyone would agree. Besides, your statement that the Book of Mormon does not follow standard historical methods <i>presumes</i> the fact that Joseph Smith didn't actually translate an ancient record, something which is a point of view not shared by many of the Wikipedia audience. Moreover, if pseudohistory is defined as you say, we should also categorize the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> article as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudohistory_b53e.html" title="Category:Pseudohistory">Category:pseudohistory</a>.

<dd>Though I am an LDS of a more scientific discipline, I agree with COGDEN that this type of subject demands equal parity to be NPOV. Either all religious chronicle texts are defined as pseudohistory, or none of them are. I also object to "pseudo" as it implies "false". Here at Wikipedia we do not decide such things when it comes to someone's belief, which is itself usually not a scientific thing. Until a pan-religion-topic concensus can be found on this issue, I'm removing the category until we discuss the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Hindu texts, the Qabbalah, Gaelic mythology, Hawaiian religion, <i>all</i> of it. Because it's going to be sacred and believed as truth in <i>someone's</i> eyes, and the definition of "pseudohistory" <i>first</i> must be crystal clear in <i>everyone's</i> eyes with <i>full concensus</i> before we go around labeling it on religious text articles. Afterall, if "pseudo" means "false", then it's unscientific because the scientific method doesn't <i>disprove</i> them — it merely cannot prove nor disprove their truthfulness either way, for lack of empirical evidence. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 03:08, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure I completely agree - Pseudepigraphia is the study of texts whose authorship and authenticity is "disputed," not "false." In this case the connotation and denotation are in conflict. Definitely the Book of Mormon texts are disputed, but are not proven false. I do agree with COgden that a more appropriate category should be used, but I don't see the current as a problem - it is a disputed history, and according to the referenced "methods" (however reliable and unreliable) it fits into the discipline. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 16:25, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand it, the term <i>pseudepigrapha</i> technically means <i>false epigraph</i>. That is, they are works that are ascribed to an author who didn't actually write them. (I verified this in the Oxford English Dictionary.) <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 22:52, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And it would be POV to say the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and other mainstream texts are <i>not</i> disputed. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 06:55, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this is the connotation by readers (as well as the "technical" explanation), then I agree, let's leave it off. However, I read the pre-fix "pseudo" as "disputed" or "unexplained," not "false." (However, this would bring up another question for the editor categorizing this topic - false epigraph - as in statue/historical marker inscription or motto/tag line? In this context it makes absolutetly no sense.)</p>
<p>Let's keep the category removed and reference the Oxford connotation COgden referenced as the reasoning why it is removed. Gilgamesh, incidentally, Muslims accept the bible as "scripture," but don't reference it like the Qur'an. The reason why is they believe that the bible was altered in the second century and prior by those "believers of the book" (Jews and Christians) who had ulterior motives. That was one reason why the Prophet Muhammed was called (I'm oversimplifying and have probably offended in my explanation. Sorry!). I tell you this (which you probably already know), because they would say that many parts of the Bible are disputed or false. In this way, almost a third of the earth's population (1.8 Billion) believe that the bible is either false and/or disputed historically. And that is just taking into account the Islam nations. Most non-Judeo-Christians would not care one way or the other. So, I think it is perfectly NPOV to say the bible is a disputed text, but that is irrelevant now that you and COgden have convinced me to leave off the disputed category. Hope I'm not sounding to lecture-y, just trying to give context on my view.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Facsimile translation deletion</span></h2>

<dl>
<dd>These theories were advanced after <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptology.html" title="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> managed to translate ancient <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_hieroglyphs.html" title="Egyptian hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, some huge abnormalities were found.

<p>This has nothing to do with the article on the Book of Mormon. I am working on an article aobut the Hypocephalus which will allow this argument there.

<p><a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETatarize_16b5.html" title="User:Tatarize">User:Tatarize</a> suggested and made some edits saying that "Summary does not assume dispute. Stating book events as fact is PoV." I disagree. Nearly every topic in the Wikipedia could be disputed. If you re-read Wikipedia's NPOV policy, it allows for both sides of every agument, however, topics are to be stated for what they <i>claim to be</i> rather than what others claim about them. To add in words like "supposed," "might," "is said to have," "was said to have," "claims" breaks up the reading of any article, and frankly is poor writing. In addition to poor writing, if we edited Tatarize's talk page how he edited this section it would read something like this (not an attack, just a lighthearted illustration, would love more insight into your edit):</p>
<dl>
<dd>I <i>claim</i> to be currently working on expanding <i>what I consider to be</i> the heck out of <i>what claims to be</i> the Stargate SG-1 information page. Don't get me wrong, but the <i>supposed</i> Star Trek article <i>is said to have</i> information on <i>alleged</i> characters <i>that I claim</i> I haven't even heard of, and I've <i>allegedly</i> watched all the <i>episodes that claim to be</i> shows....</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not a personal attack of any sort, just using it to illustrate a point on writing. It is better that articles - especially those on controversial subjects (including religious topics and sacred texts) - state what the belief, doctrine or whatever (literary work in this case) as it is given by believers/adherents (or what the book claims in this case). Then, an alternate explanation can be given and evidence/research introduced that says why or why not it could have been a probable explanation/theory.</p>
<p>In this way, the readers do not stumble over words and are given both sides of the argument. With that said, I suggest we revert back the changes, but want other imput first. Tatarize, I may be persuaded the other way, but need to hear more thoughts about the word usage and your POV issues with the article. I agree with you that the article could be more balanced, but the word usage you introduced is not the right approach. I look forward to your reccommendations on how to improve the article.

<dd>IMHO the changes made by Taterize are inconsistent with good english - the absense of the present tense, the book claims to do such and such - the assumption on this page is that one summarizes the book - controversy about the book is better placed in the many other pages that discuss it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrodel_b7c2.html" title="User:Trodel">Trodel</a> 21:43, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC) Can someone rollback this change - there was a lot of discussion before the current language was put in place and to change it without discussion first is rude.

<dd>I revised the <i>Summary of the book's narrative</i> section to reflect the active voice again. The title and context clearly indicate that the summary is "of the book's narrative" and the constant use of POV language to challenge the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is inappropriate. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrodel_b7c2.html" title="User:Trodel">Trodel</a> 12 Jan 2005 (don't remember the time - it was morning - forgot to sign)

<dd>The primary problem with the tone there is a reader who is doesn't already know about the Book of Mormon wouldn't be able to tell what is POV and what is fact about the work. <b>The primary objection of POV is probably only going to occur in the BoM. The book makes claims of authorship, and these claims are easily assumed to be neutral facts about the work rather than claims made by the work.</b> Making this distinction clearer does make the English sound horrific. Perhaps add a paragraph introduction about the dates and authors being claims of the book itself. <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETatarize_16b5.html" title="User:Tatarize">Tat</a> 10:45, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Examples:
<dl>
<dd>”The Words of Mormon written in AD 385 by Mormon, is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah.”
<dl>
<dd>The tone seems to step away from telling the story although, it doesn't actually. Non-Mormons and critics wouldn't agree. The Book of Mormon says it was written by Mormon. The book of Mormon says it was written in AD 385. This is not made clear. Author and date are typically neutral. However it's unknowable if these are concrete facts or part of the narrative.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>”He included the books 1 Nephi to Omni, then abridged large quantity of collected records detailing the national history from the end of Omni until his own time.”
<dl>
<dd>Again, somebody who isn't familiar with the BoM wouldn't be aware that this is a claim by the book of Mormon that such a person existed and worked on the book. It seems to be a statement of fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Ether is an abridgement (misspelled in article "abridgment") by Moroni, written shortly after his father, Mormon's, death."
<dl>
<dd>Again, talking about the abstract of the construction of the book would be assumed to be neutral. It is not however. As these are again claims of the book.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Moroni then witnesses the final destruction of his people and the idolatrous state of the remaining society."
<dl>
<dd>The prior lines establishes Moroni as an author of a book that actually exists and therefore a real person outside of the Book of Mormon itself.

</dd>
<dd>My reading of the article is that it is clear that there are alternate explanations for the Book of Mormon. Many of which are discussed in the Origins section. As pointed out above, the narrative of the Book of Mormon is confusing enough and to replace the simple declartive sentences with more complex ones only makes it more difficult to understand the summary. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> is treated similarly with the brief summary attributing the books as described internally by the Bible, but a section on [[New Testament#Authorship|Authorship] that discusses modern critical inquiry.</dd>
<dd>I do agree however, that the summary could use an explanation at the top because the Book of Mormon is so unfamiliar to others - maybe similar to the "A Brief Explanation" that is discussed under style on this page - did any of that discussion ever lead to an addition to the pages. <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a> 17:32, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the consensus is against my fixing of things. It just needs to establish the claims as part of the book and not independent objective analysis. The best corollary I can think of is to state Huck Finn wrote the book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_dd2b.html" title="The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></i> which is a claim made by the book not objective fact. Very few books make claims as to who the author actually is. However if the claim is made it should be stated as such. There's just a problem there. Go ahead and fix it.

<p>I removed the following because (as a Mormon) I don't think it is true: "But not all <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saints</a> consider the <i>Book of Mormon</i> to be a work of history.

"</p>
<p>From my experience, if a person does not accept the Book of Mormon to be true, they cannot be baptized. It is a fundamental principal, that members of the church believe that the book is true in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>My appologies if the statement I removed was in reference to another "mormon" sect, but if that was the case it needs to be clarified.</p>

<p><small>Recent edits to claim that the BoM is changed, that prophecies have been unfulfilled, etc. are not supported either on this page or in the comment to the edit. Additionally, attributing a books claim of its historicity to the book is sufficient to describe that it is a particular view point - it is POV to add edits like "alleged", "sole", "created", and then use scare quotes are around words like "translated", "divine inspiration" and "golden tablets". Then to claim no one else has seen them when there are (granted disputed by some) at least 11 people who have claimed to see the plates. The issues are already covered sufficiently in the critical view seciton. 205.188.116.14 13:44, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>I don't actively contribute to this article, but what is the problem with <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">Gabrielsimon</a>? He's been told over and over again that his edits are inappropriate and he keeps making them over and over. Shouldn't he be banned?</small></p>
<p><small>His issues:</small></p>
<ol>
<li><small><b>The Golden Plates were never photographed</b>: The word "Photography" wasn't even coined when Smith translated the plates. Even if photography were common back then, he was commanded not to flaunt them about. Photographing them would be a direct violation of a direct commandment. He did show them to 11 witnesses who never—<i>never</i>—recanted on their testimonies of seeing and handling the plates, even though some of them later fell away from the Church. Since they had become disenchanted with the Church, wouldnt' recanting their testimonies be the best way to discredit the Church if they really hadn't witnessed the plates?</small></li>
<li><small><b>Unfulfilled prophecies</b>: Totally off-topic for this article (as <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.14.html" title="User:205.188.116.14">205.188.116.14</a> states above). Nevertheless, the stated prophecies are not canonized scripture of the Church. Also, many talks and lectures were copied down by hand and contain numerous errors and so forth.</small></li>

<p><small>heres a thought, just a thought , but considering the timeline that the book of mormon speaks of, why is it then that none of the native american , (ir incan area peoples) legdends speak of a place such as the lands described in said book? surely they would have been noticed, but as far as i have researched native american mythology and oral history ( extensively, might i add, i quite enjoy that topic) i find no mention oif any lands even remotely resembling the described localities in the book of mormon. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">Gabrielsimon</a> 29 June 2005 21:24 (UTC)</small></p>
