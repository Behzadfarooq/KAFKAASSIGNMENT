<p>Can I use this template for press releases? Is it good practice to use a template for a purpose other than it was orginally intended? I don't see a template specifically for press releases.

<dd>Just guessing, but a book reference can and often is cited more than once in an article; possibly in very different contexts. A footnote is always cited only once. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-12-28&#160;17:22&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<dd>Yes I agree with that, but the {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_harvard_c2c3.html" title="Template:Ref harvard">ref harvard</a>}} template (used in the text) includes a link to the notes at the bottom of the page. That way the user can link to the note from the text. It would be simple enough to include that hypertext in {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book reference</a>}}. A back link (from note to text) is not needed.

<p>Hi all. Based on work by Netoholic and CBD I prepared a version of the template code for book reference that uses Netoholic's CSS trick. The code is at User:Adrian Buehlmann/work/b-ref/1. Test cases are at User talk:Adrian Buehlmann/work/b-ref/1. If <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a> really gets removed without a replacement in WikiCode (see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html#Template:Qif" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">Tfd</a>) we could probably use said b-ref/1 which does not include any other template and would thus be compliant with that accursed <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> (See also the lengthy discussions there). Please provide ideas and opinions on how to proceed. Many thanks in advance. Adrian Buehlmann 23:34, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support development of a bot that will replace (but not directly subst:) the occasions where this and other such templates are used. Providing a handy shortcut for creating references is tolerable, but depending on them long-term is burdensome. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So this is where we still disagree. I think using a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> (in a version that complies with <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>)) to add citations to articles clearly outweighs its costs. One benefit is that book data is clearly identified with metadata which can later be used to migrate references to something better (possibly database entries). Another benefit of using such a template is that even newbies are able to create consistent and correct book references. Given that you were willing to further discuss here, could you further specify what makes the new version of book reference so burdensome (from your point of view) that you prefer to rather not use this template at all? Would there be anything we could do such that you would tolerate the insertion of calls to the WP:AUM-compliant book reference template into articles, or do we face the threat that you are actively going to remove such calls? --Adrian Buehlmann 20:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to add my voice to Adrian Buehlmann's - The potential and actual benefits of reference templates far outweigh their cost (from an editorial point of view). Furthermore, the implementation possibilities will presumably only increase and improve. Even if there is some cost at present, it is likely to decrease as software improvements are made, especially if they are directed towards this particular problem. "depending on them long-term is burdensome" needs to be elaborated. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 20:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Rather than replacing/deprecating templates in general, we should focus on replacing/deprecating <i>meta</i>-templates. Book references, like series boxes, are to me a plausible and useful way of using templates. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:59, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But that's the point, {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">Book reference</a>}} <i>is</i> a meta-template. I've been removing it in every article where I've encountered it over the past week or so, after becoming aware of the full ramifications of <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 21:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please note carefully that my proposal to change (which is nearly 100% made by Netoholic) is <i>not</i> a metatemplate. May I ask you to reconsider your removals given that my new proposed version of book reference (see on start of this thread) would be used (instead of the actual revision). Thank you. --Adrian Buehlmann 23:15, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But at the moment, {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book reference</a>}} is still a meta-template, right, until it gets replaced by your version? I'll stop removing the template if it's going to be replaced by your non-mt version in the immediate future. There must be some good reason I don't understand why it hasn't already been replaced. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 06:02, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The reason is that <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> is difficult to implement and thus takes some time. Second, Book reference is a high use template (<a href="../../../h/r/t/WP%7EHRT_89de.html" title="WP:HRT">WP:HRT</a>) and thus should be changed with caution in order not to stress the servers and the users/wikipedians needlessly. We just cannot do our template-surgery "in situ", reverting back-and forth because every save ripples instantly through to all affected articles. There was also some disagreement how to do that surgery. And last, book reference is protected (due to its high-volume status, see also <a href="../../../h/r/t/WP%7EHRT_89de.html" title="WP:HRT">WP:HRT</a>) and thus it can only be edited by admins.

<dd>If we can get a license from Netoholic and Phil Boswell to use that (or at least a promise not to revert us), I would agree to take the weeble solution, given that strong CSS-hack opposition we now have (see <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki_talk%7ECommon.css_e2a2.html" title="MediaWiki talk:Common.css">MediaWiki talk:Common.css</a>).

<dd>Couple of things. First, I've seen some indication that Netoholic is working on ways to reduce/remove the non-CSS browser problems... still using CSS to hide data, but stripping out any extraneous 'junk' from the final rendering. I'd like to see more about this and get thoughts on whether it is viable. There are a couple of minor things where CSS coding is tricky or doesn't work right (parameters with line breaks in them &amp; conditionally setting styles), but there are similar issues with Weeble (problems with anything that uses '|' as a separator - including table markup), but those can be worked around. The biggest issue is the browser compatibility problem. Second, is it worth exploring 'dual calls' for things like Book reference if we go the Weeble route? That is, change the current 'Book reference' template so that it contains nothing except, {{Book ref2 |if=|First={{{First|}}}|Last={{{Last|}}}|Year={{{Year|}}}... et cetera}} and then put the 'Weeble' version at a 'Book ref2' template. This would allow all of the existing 'Book reference' calls to continue working without adjustment (the '|if=' gets inserted prior to the call to the second function) while future calls could go directly to 'Book ref2' by including the '|if=' in the new calls. It is double transclusion, but would result in a seamless transition. A bot could then later be set up to change the older calls to the new format or this could be done manually to eventually remove the intermediate step. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:13, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Credits should go first-hand to Netoholic, who is the original inventor of this CSS trick and to CBD. I've just tested and formatted/commented a bit.

<p>I oppose this change (as you may have expected). The proposed template may be compliant with WP:AUM, but it's not at all compliant with controlling the basic content of pages. Although hidden from visual browsers using the CSS hack, the blank template contains the following literal content:</p>
<pre>
 <b>[[|, ]],  () ( ). ""  [ {{{Title}}}], , , , : . ..</b>
</pre>
<p>As mentioned elsewhere, this technique breaks accessibility (including a WCAG priority 1 checkpoint), and adds arbitrary classes to HTML elements on the page risking page layout breakage. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-01-19&#160;00:21&#160;Z</small></i></p>

<dd>Applying the blank template violates its semantics as the title paramter is required. So you will never find the blank temlate applied regularly to any article.

<dd><code>With due respect: Per <i>"and adds arbitrary classes to HTML elements"</i> you are plain wrong.

There are no more "arbitrary" classes. Please note that there has been a significant update to the CSS trick. The core element of the newest version of the CSS trick now looks like this: <code>&lt;span class{{{param1|}}}="hiddenStructure"&gt;param1: {{{param1|}}}&lt;/span&gt;</code>. <code>"class*"</code> is then <b>removed by <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_Tidy_0243.html" title="HTML Tidy">HTML Tidy</a></b> so you will <i>never</i> find things like "classXXX" in the html. --Adrian Buehlmann 10:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</code></dd>

<dd>If I understand correctly, Netoholic's adjustments greatly reduce the amount of extraneous text which would be passed in non-CSS browsers, but (as above) don't eliminate it entirely. I think Neto's changes hide the CSS structure and unset parameters (by just always defaulting them blank) but leave hardcoded text (in this case the punctuation) triggered by the conditions in place. Is that correct? There also seems to be some concern about not complying with accessibility standards. Does the Weeble example above comply with those standards? Since Weeble is entirely based on Wiki logic I'd assume it doesn't break any standards, but may not be any more portable than CSS. If CSS only has a problem with unsuppressed conditional text (non-parameters) then I'd think it is ok to use it on templates which don't have such text - of which I can think of a few. I'm still wondering what people think of double transclusion Weeble... existing calls stay the same and the existing templates are changed to just call weeblecode versions by inserting the '|if=' (as outlined above). I'm pondering a 'Reference' template in Weeble which is called by 'Book reference', 'Journal reference', et cetera and just passes in the relevant parameters for each (along with the 'if'). --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 00:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I withdraw my request to change. I think it would have been a viable temporary solution. If anybody can agree with CBD's proposal above (weeble plus an additional level of template call) I agree with that. I would also be willing to add the necessary |if= directly to all calls of book reference such that there is no additional call level. If there is clear consensus to do this, I would offer to do this with my bot account. --Adrian Buehlmann 09:32, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I object to your bot doing this task. This "if=|" statement will be confusing to new editors, and there is still an option on the table to make it standard practice that reference templates be replaced with their wikitext equivalents on a regular basis. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 09:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Objection accepted. I will not run my bot to add this. So there remains the additional call level option. --Adrian Buehlmann 09:53, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't think '|if=' is any more confusing than templates in general. If it is used people will learn to understand it. That said, the best option may be text replacement with some sort of marker template that never gets updated. The reason I say this is the frequent use of book references. No matter <b>how</b> a template for them is implemented they will still run afoul of the primary concern <i>driving</i> <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. It really doesn't matter whether there are several thousand meta book references or several thousand simple book references... every time the formatting template is updated every page which calls it gets purged from the cache and then needs to be rebuilt the next time it is called. So how about this idea. We have a template which does nothing except attach the anchor point to the text; {{Reference |id=Reference-Dunkerson-2006|&lt;full text of reference&gt;}}. This passes in the text and the id name for the anchor point (in this case you could link to the text with [[#Reference-Dunkerson-2006]]). Since the template has no conditional behaviour CSS &amp; weeble become irrelevant. All references are still linked to a template, but since that template does very little updates to it should rarely be needed. The only drawback is that you can't quickly change the format of all references to a new standard... but you <b>could</b> have a bot which goes through and updates the parameters passed to this simple reference template to put them in whatever new format.

<dd>I cannot see what a bot could do to book references if that meta information is removed. bref's will quickly detoriate without any chance for a bot to extract the book data. The general idea isn't that bad, but why for god's sake do you all try to fix each and every problem that might possibly emerge in this one step?

<dd>Thanks for the notice. But it is still not clear what we should do. Brion wrote <i>"I'd like to ask that anyone fighting against ugly, fragile meta templates at this time do so based on their ugliness and fragility"</i>. This still leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Qif, CSS, weeble - alle are ugly and fragile. Qif was up for immediate shooting. I have no clue wheter this still holds true. But I doubt if we gain much by replacing one ugliness with another.

<p>Since the CSS hack has been added, I've replaced {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book reference</a>}} and {{journal reference}} with literal text in the references section of "<a href="../../../t/-/3/T-34.html" title="T-34">T-34</a>".

<p>Removing the template actually allowed me to improve the format slightly, adding quotation marks around article titles, avoiding double punctuation after an article title ending with a question mark, and avoiding an undesirable space between the issue and page numbers.</p>
<p>This could be made even easier by using a simple template that wrapped the citation tag around the literal content and added a backlink, but it's not necessary. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-01-23&#160;21:19&#160;Z</small></i></p>

<dd>Still puzzling. Just to make shure that there is no misunderstanding: Phil, you are certainly not part of that "group of prominent admins pushing it" (the CSS hack). I thought you know who I mean. I was in fear of snowspinner blanking qif, that drove me to request the CSS here. Yes I was the one who asked you to put the CSS thing here, because I felt book ref was in danger and CSS was the best thing I had at that time (remember: evreybody was against nearly everthing and Neto still wearing his <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> license). The removal of the policy tag on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> completely changed everything.

<dd>Sorry, yes, I misunderstood which diff you were referring to: that was a minor alteration which would not have sparked any meta-template row, and I went ahead and did it because I couldn't think of any good reason not to. I'm obviously having a bad week <a href="../../../c/r/y/Image%7ECry.png_e29e.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/d/d8/Cry.png/16px-Cry.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" longdesc="../../../c/r/y/Image%7ECry.png_e29e.html" /></a>. My argument stands, however. We need to avoid bouncing straight back with a {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}}-based implantation which we then proceed to fiddle with, adding new features to and tweaking. This is an excellent opportunity to test out some additional features which we have been wanting to consider for a while but got distracted from, like adding a chapter-specific URL for instance. If there is the outside possibility that the conditional syntax might be added in any reasonable time-frame, it would also grant us a much higher moral ground if we were willing to wait a bit and cooperate with <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> at <a href="../../../a/u/m/WT%7EAUM_1fff.html" title="WT:AUM">WT:AUM</a>.

<dd>I'm a big advocate of that method, but it requires an 'if' parameter to be set blank in the <b>call</b> to the template. There are basically two ways to accomplish that:
<ol>
<li>Go through and change <b>every</b> single existing {{book reference |whatever}} call to {{book reference |if=|whatever}}.</li>
<li>Change <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">Template:Book reference</a> to {{reference |if=|First={{{First|}}}|Last={{{Last|}}}|Author={{{Author|}}}|Authorlink={{{Authorlink|}}}|Coauthors={{{Coauthors|}}} |Year={{{Year|}}}|Month={{{Month|}}}|Date={{{Date|}}}|Title={{{Title|}}}|Chapter={{{Chapter|}}}|Editor={{{Editor|}}}|Others={{{Others|}}} |Edition={{{Edition|}}}|Pages={{{Pages|}}}|Publisher={{{Publisher|}}}|Location={{{Location|}}}|ID={{{ID|}}}|URL={{{URL|}}} }}</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first is a huge amount of work. The second is exceedingly simply (it just adds '|if=' to the existing parameter list), but technically would make it a 'nested template'. Of course, it is currently making something like twenty 'nested' calls to qif and booland (which itself again calls qif)... as opposed to just <b>one</b> extra template call under the version above. I actually set up <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7EReference_d0d1.html" title="Template:Reference">Template:Reference</a> with the if parameter method above and tested it on <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_Sandbox4_b42b.html" title="User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox4">User:CBDunkerson/Sandbox4</a>... so we really could just change the template to the code above and all existing book reference calls should work with that one extra template call instead of the current twenty or so. Good idea? Of course, people could also just include the '|if=' in a direct call to 'reference' and then it isn't a 'nested' template at all. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 03:36, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be nice if there were an option for generating an unparenthesized date at the end, which is one standard reference style.

It's one thing to try and argue that this template is needed as a handy shortcut tool for new and old editors. It is another thing completely to take this tool beyond that point. It seems to me that editors that like these reference templates ought to first decide whether any "special markup" for references, beyond simple italics, is specifically necessary and desireable across the board. If so, then there is no way this template can even begin to be usable across more than a simple percentage of articles. Don't use template to take the place of making software feature requests, like <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite.php" class="extiw" title="meta:Cite.php">meta:Cite.php</a>. If you expand the use of this template too far, you're only creating extra work for editors down the line. I'd encourage people to use this minimally and only for adding new references. Where possible, straightforward wikitext is better and complex meta-templates should be avoided, since they can be a barrier to new editors<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;oldid=37484592" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;oldid=37484592" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:45, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

*Ruth Lewin Sime, ''Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics'',

</pre>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see the information is now tagged. We now know that "Ruth" is the first name of the author, and "Lewin Sime" is her last name. Something which is not deriveable by a computer from the original reference as there is such a wide range of formats. I would say this alone merits my edit on that article, which you reverted (there are other benefits too). The goal of wikipedia is not only to write good articles, the wikitext itself also represents a value. These kind of references can be easily gathered by any bot to be used for whatever we will have for book references in the future (best some support in MediaWiki, which is very likely to happen some day). In the mean time, I would recommend not going around and systematically remove these template calls. You had no valid reason to revert these book reference calls on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lise_Meitner_d12c.html" title="Lise Meitner">Lise_Meitner</a>.

<p><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a>, I'm an editor that is very glad to use templates like <b>Book reference</b> whenever I can, instead of plain wikitext. The reason is that it helps me do a better job, more easily. It helps me gather all the relevant data, by giving me a list of parameters to fill out. It takes care of formatting, letting me concentrate on the content only. And I have confidence that in the future it will be easier for an automated mechanism to carry forward data from a structured template than plain wikitext. Templates as a mechanism have weaknesses, but I'm surprised that you seem to prefer no mechanism to this limited mechanism.

<dd>Some preliminary comments (I have yet to think about your proposed new parameters "accessmonth", "accessyear" and "format"). First it would be good if you could put such proposals under your user space and not in the template namespace. I would recommend for example to move the contents of template:book reference test to <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_Book_reference_test_130d.html" title="User:Gracefool/Book reference test">User:gracefool/Book reference test</a> (or whatever name you prefer after the "/"). Technically, there is no need to have test templates in template namespace. For the example I gave, you then can just call that template as <code>{{User:gracefool/Book reference test|...</code>. Please move template:Book reference test to under your user space and then edit the remaining redirect at template:book reference test and replace it if <code>{{delete}}</code>. --Adrian Buehlmann 08:26, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I perfectly agree to switch over book reference to lower case parameters. But I would recommend not to do it as you are proposing. I think it is better to create a new template, for example under the name <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">template:cite book</a> which provides lower case parameters <i>exclusively</i> and then replace all calls to book reference with calls to "cite book", thereby adapting the paramaters call by call. I would volunteer to do this on all articles by using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>. book reference could then be deprecated and deleted when done with this. I made a similar proposal at template talk:Journal reference#Case of par names. --Adrian Buehlmann 08:35, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. As per the proposed new parameters "accessmonth", "accessyear" and "format" I see a bit a problem with the recently added parameter ChapterURL (see <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template_talk%7EBook_reference_0c0e.html#New_parameter_ChapterURL" title="Template talk:Book reference">Template talk:Book reference#New parameter ChapterURL</a>). Would that need an access date too then? (just some ruminating, your idea needs further thinking). --Adrian Buehlmann 09:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks. Moved. I don't see the benefit of having exclusively lower-case parameters - what's wrong with being able to do both, like with {{<a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">web reference</a>}}? As for ChapterURL, I don't think that's a problem it should be at the same site as URL, and it's unlikely that one page would disappear without the other also disappearing. If ChapterURL does disappear, it should be easy to fix, so long as there is an accessdate for URL (which is less likely to break). <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">··gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">☺</a></li>

<li>The benefit of having exclusively lower-case parameters is simplicity of the template code, and ease of maintenance on the template itself and on the call side. It seems to me that the users tend to prefer lower case params anyway and that there is some consensus to prefer that. On web reference the doc talks about upper case params as "obsolete". I would propose to deprecated upercase entirely. It is very hard to go back from a two-way template (upper- and lower case) to single way (lowercase only) template. Onother – maybe no longer so important – argument comes from that pressure originating from <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> and the threat to <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>. The reasoning behing this is that if qif should get abolished (which happend to if) before we have conditionals in MediaWiki (see my talk with Wikipedia CTO Brion Vibber at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrion_VIBBER_3e21.html#The_future_of_qif" title="User talk:Brion VIBBER">User talk:Brion VIBBER#The future of qif</a>) it would be nearly impossible to convert book ref to using weeble code trick (example) or <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:hiddenStructure</a> (the only stop-gap alternatives of qif known today). <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> lost some momentum (policy tag has been removed). But the battle on qif is not yet over. I think we have a ceasefire now. Wikilife is still dangerous and complicated here. --Adrian Buehlmann 11:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No freakin' way. {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} is so much better than the alternatives. <a href="../../../h/i/d/Wikipedia%7EHiddenStructure_c11c.html" title="Wikipedia:HiddenStructure">Wikipedia:hiddenStructure</a> is not an option, since it breaks the site for many browsers. I'm in favour of a meta-template for references, since they are all almost the same. Eg. using a meta-template with Media=Book for books, Media=Journal for journals, etc. So I see my new {{<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_cite_book_b46b.html" title="User:Gracefool/cite book">cite book</a>}} as a temporary measure. Keeping the same name makes adoption faster and easier. Qif can't be deleted easily, since so many templates use it, so I don't think the added complexity of different casing matters much. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">··gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">☺</a> 12:28, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks. Looks much simpler now. It is good to keep it as simple as possibly (as per the ugliness). How about deprecating book reference and start a new one at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">template:cite book</a> (with only lower case params)? I would volunteer to convert all calls to the new cite book. We are already doing the same on template:journal reference (see User:Adrian Buehlmann/AWB/migrate to cite journal), which I deprecated in favor for <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">template:cite journal</a> while talking with <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">user:Splash</a> on this. It is better to do the migration by the help of a new template. See also the discussion on my talk with Splash on this. --Adrian Buehlmann 08:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you like. What would be really cool is to merge them all straight to {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_3937.html" title="Template:Citation">citation</a>}} and save ourselves a bunch of work. I suppose that may be a bit much for people to swallow though.</dd>
<dd>The other thing is, I'm not finished with it yet.

<dd>I think a one big step into {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_3937.html" title="Template:Citation">citation</a>}} is a bit too much in one step, but we might keep that as a general goal in mind. I would propose to do a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm.html" title="Divide and conquer algorithm">divide and conquer algorithm</a> and move the reference templates first to lower case one by one. It is also a quite tough job to convert the calls. I'm doing this on journal ref with <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> at the moment (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adrian_Buehlmann_Bot_5e64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adrian Buehlmann Bot">contribs</a>). Though I have that great WP:AWB I still do have to check each diff carefully as there are some nasty cases that are difficult to catch with regexes.

<dd>I dont't think starting to move is a problem. As long as we can agree on the spelling of the preexisting parameters (all lowercase). Your new parameters aren't touched anyway, as they are inexistent in the old book reference. --Adrian Buehlmann 09:30, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've seen them, but I do not understand them. That's why I haven't answered. The cite book template does the same as book reference. It's only a new name for the template and all parameters are in lowercase. Gracefool added some new stuff, which I partially reverted, because it is not compatible to the old book reference. While I was talking with him about these new proposed things, I noticed that the new cite book already spreads into articles. So what's that bad about cite book then that isn't already bad in book reference? Is it the name "cite book" you have problems with?

I don't mind <i>implementations</i> being relatively complex (qif etc), as only a small subset of editors will be dabbling there. However almost every editor can be expected to give references, so the client templates need to simple - even if that meets we have to provide a suite of templates rather than one uber-template. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 14:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
