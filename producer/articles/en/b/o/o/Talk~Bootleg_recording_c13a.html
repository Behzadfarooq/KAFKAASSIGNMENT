I know that it needs more/better print and book references, but I don't have them handy just yet. Any other suggestions on improving structure, flow, prose?

<dd>One suggestion for expansion is non-US information. The circulation of bootlegs is very popular in Europe (perhaps more so than in the US) and a lot of the high-quality production bootleggers are based in Japan. Not much is said about those countries. Also 1969 sounds like a rather late date for the first rock bootleg? Is that just for vinyl? There must have been bootleg reel-to-reel tapes circulating earlier (i.e., the Beatles). <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelHistBuff_2de7.html" title="User:RelHistBuff">RelHistBuff</a> 13:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bootlegging is often incorrectly referred to as <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piracy.html" title="Piracy">piracy</a> but there is an important difference between the two terms. Bootlegging is trading in recordings that the record companies either do not own or are unwilling to release. Piracy is the illegal copying/sale of recordings that are available commercially. Although bootlegging is not legitimate since it invariably violates at least some copyright, it can at least claim it is giving music fans something they want that is unobtainable from official sources. Piracy however cannot make such a moral claim since it purely done for profit rather than filling a consumer niche.</p>
<p>However piracy (as in internet filesharing) is typically done where no money changes hands, thereby nobody is making money off someone elses recording. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArm_8860.html" title="User:Arm">Arm</a></p>

<p>I think this article leaves the impression that bootlegging is mostly not a good thing, but with some exceptions. I think it's just the opposite. I don't know of any artists that oppose it and I don't know of anyone selling it or anyone willing to pay for low quality recordings. It's all about being a fan and spreading around novel tracks for people who are really into it. I think the first paragraph ought to be re-written. It reads like something from the RIAA.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.57.31.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.57.31.240_41ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.57.31.240">contribs</a>) 18:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Well, 66.57.31.240, I trade bootlegs all the time - but I think the first paragraph is fine. It simply defines what a bootleg is.

<p>How about getting rid of "A bootleg recording is a video or musical recording, distributed for profit or other financial compensation". That definition of a bootleg is flawed. It could have something to do with profit. It needn't. In your case it doesn't. Does that mean you don't actualy trade bootlegs?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.163.120.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.163.120.251_0853.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.163.120.251">contribs</a>) 12:35, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>It' seems like a fine article, now. BillK also known as 66.57.31.240 and 24.163.120.251</p>
<p>Just wondering if you can clear up the issue of sharing bootleg material when its not for profit. I came across a link which ruled that actual bootleg recordings are completely constitutional but does not make reference to sharing not for profit, or the differences if any. Here is the <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/bparchive?year=2004&amp;post=2004-09-28,1" class="external text" title="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/bparchive?year=2004&amp;post=2004-09-28,1" rel="nofollow">court ruling link</a> Also I don't know if this has any place in law, but seemingly sharing bootleg recordings publicly should have no effect in sales declining, rather quite the contrary, it promotes an artist, and would in my opinion promote sales especially in the event that the artist later produces an official live recording of the concert. <i>Yossi</i> 10:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs to emphasize the fact that it's completely legal to trade/freely distribute bootlegs. As long as the recordings aren't copyrighted and as long as there's no money involved then it's not illegal. The actual act of recording or obtaining the material might be illegal, but possesion, non-commercial broadcast, and free distribution of uncopyrighted recordings is 100% legal. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.190.160.82 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.190.160.82_e45a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.190.160.82">contribs</a>) 22:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Keeping any external links at all in this article is an invitation to continued link insertion by the distributors of bootlegs, well-meaning or not, and I think we have good reason to eliminate the section. — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 00:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That and as someone else point out up there a bit ^ <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a>, that is what search engines are for. Wiki is not here to provide links, but to provide meaningful content. Any external link should add to the subject or provide more information on the subject.

<dd>Some of these sites have useful information, albeit in their wikis<a href="http://wiki.etree.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://wiki.etree.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and forums<a href="http://forums.etree.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.etree.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I agree links to bootleg BitTorrent trackers have to go as they mostly list their own content and are not useful as reference material on the subject of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">Bootleg recording</a>. Furthermore, since some of these sites don't want the publicity, they should be removed immediately.</dd>

<li><a href="http://www.bootlegarchive.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bootlegarchive.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootleg Archive</a> - Website for a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_Connect_f409.html" title="Direct Connect">Direct Connect</a> hub of lossless bootlegs</li>

<dd>No objection from me. I think your analysis of it leading to a revert war is correct but I agree that these links don't really add much to the article. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 18:18, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Removed those, and expanded <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">CatherineMunro</a>'s comment. Added Etree <a href="http://wiki.etree.org/" class="external text" title="http://wiki.etree.org/" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> &amp; <a href="http://forums.etree.org/" class="external text" title="http://forums.etree.org/" rel="nofollow">forum</a> as they seem to have good information — hopefully those will provide examples of pertinent, informative links.</dd>
<dd>Also snipped <a href="http://www.digitalboots.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalboots.net/" rel="nofollow">DigitalBoots - lossless live links</a>, tho there might be a useful sub-section on that site, and <a href="http://people.freenet.de/bootlegbrowser/" class="external text" title="http://people.freenet.de/bootlegbrowser/" rel="nofollow">BootlegBrowser</a>, which mostly links to downloadables. – <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 20:36, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Dead's policy is notable enough to be expanded a little (and not being a Deadhead myself, I'm sure someone else can do the work).</p>
<p>However, starting with "Also, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour stated...", this section wanders off topic into band member comments that may not have the weight of official policy, and unverfied comments about other bands that don't add much to the article.</p>
<p>I'd delete from "Also, Pink..." to end of subsection. Any objections? — <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 04:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
