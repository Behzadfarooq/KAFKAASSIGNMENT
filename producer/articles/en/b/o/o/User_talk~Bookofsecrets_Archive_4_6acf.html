<p>I have noticed that there is still doubt in the minds of some that my friend User:Waya sahoni is Jeff Merkey. I can honestly and 100% postively attest that these are two completely different individuals, both of Native American descent. I have become acquainted with both of them and merely wanted to set the record straight once and for all. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 00:46, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I notice you didn't answer the question. Have you been in the physical presense of two different people who you know to be Jeff Merkey and Waya sahoni? If not, then you can not authoritatively attest to the identity of either one. Your simple statement that you know them to be two separate people can't outweigh the amount of evidence available to show that they are one and the same, and it certainly can't outweigh the fact that Merkey's most recent account has treated the Waya sahoni account as one of his own. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 01:49, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have quietly observed the tension concerning my brother Jeff Merkey and all Native Americans on Wikipedia. It seems that Mr. Jimbo Wales has challenges with Native Americans. If so, the problem is his and not a problem of our people. Mr. Wales doesn't seem to like it when anyone has a difference of opinion that himself. This is a narrow minded approach and is his problem. There are numerous others here that seem to be on the same infantile path as Mr. Wales. This is most unfortunate. I will again set back and observe. These comments are of my own doing and not a product of anyone else whatsoever. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 12:02, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, you are changing the subject. Mr Merkey himself stated he was Waya sahoni. Now as for your accusations that Jimbo Wales has something against Native Americans is based on what exactly? Quite the contrary Mr Merkey seems to have a hatred for Jimbo Wales.</dd>

<li>First off there are many individuals who use the IP server that "is" owned by Jeff. So it could be one of numerous individuals. Jeff lives in Utah and Waya sahoni in Texas to the best of my knowledge. So how do you figure they are the same person? I cannot be Waya sahoni or Jeff either as I am a life long resident of Tennessee. Secondly I did not make accusations at all. It was merely an observation of mine. It seems, to me, Mr. Wales and his ilk love blocking and banning those I know to be in the Native American community. Thirdly I have no clue as to why Jeff would have a hatred of anyone. That will be between Jeff and whomever he has differences with. I merely think that Mr. Wales and his ilk are overly quick to block and ban certain individuals. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 23:40, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First.. I don't think Bookofsecrets is Jeff Merkey. I <b>do</b> think he's been duped into believing Jeff's strange reality.<br /></dd>
<dd>Next, Book, 'ol buddy. Jeff has <b>admitted</b> being all the sockpuppets he's been accused of. When he <b>thought</b> he was in the free, he went around deleting sockpuppet tags from all of his nyms. Please don't make excuses for him or try to figure out convuluted scenarios where some unknown person is using Jeff's machine. He's tried that before and failed miserably.

<li>I haven't drank anyone's Koolaid. I am my own person and I find it insulting and degrading at such an accusation. When I needed assistance while under attack my Cherokee brothers came to my rescue. Waya sahoni and others have been sharing the traditions with me of my ancestors. I was cheated out of knowing my blood as child, teenager, and young adult. I'm in my early 40's now and learning things I should have been taught as a child. Nobody else on Wikipedia has assisted me in such a manner. So whom do you think I'm going to trust first? I will march on with my Cherokee brothers with dignity and honor. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 01:01, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have read the postings about myself on the talkpage of the individual who blocked me. I was born in Clarksville, Montgomery County, Tennessee on 17 August 1963. I was raised and still live in Bumpus Mills, Stewart County, Tennessee. Honestly, I have never personally met Jeff Merkey nor Waya sahoni face to face. It is my desire to do so in the future. I have not always been a gentleman on Wikipedia, but I've been trying really hard to prove myself to be honest and ethical. I posed a few questions and made a few comments. Then I was blocked as a sockpuppet. Bookofsecrets; Bumpusmills1; and WECoyote are my own. I haven't used anything but Bookofsecrets in several months. Yes, I have a bad temper and I'm going to anger management counseling for it presently. I don't like being that way, honestly. So right now I feel that somebody pushed me to the ground and is literally kicking the manure out of me. I do not appreciate it and find it insulting and degrading. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 00:00, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some of the Wikipedia admins are occasionally a little quick on the trigger and shoot themselves in the foot. (OK, since you were the one hit, that might not be quite the right analogy.) Please don't take it personally. Since admins hate to admit their mistakes and they generally hesitate to overrule other admins, it may take a little time to remove the block on your account. I realize this is going to be frustrating for you, since it seems it should be obvious that you are not Merkey. Really the only evidence they have against your account is that you have expressed support for Merkey. I have myself expressed support for Merkey on those admittedly rare occasions when I have thought he was in the right. While I don't agree with you about Merkey's current behavior, you should not be blocked simply for disagreeing with prevailing opinion. If it makes you feel any better, I strongly suspect there is an admin or two looking for any excuse they can find to block my account. If they do so, in my case it won't be because they've mistaken me for someone else. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 00:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wado (Thank you in Cherokee) for the kind words of support. I do not observe every move Jeff makes. He is his own person. As far as I know I've not given anyone my password for wikipedia. Again I was merely asking a few questions and making a few observatory comments. That was all they were ever meant too be. I have been to Texas once in my whole life, January 1998 and way before I ever knew that Waya sahoni or Jeff Merkey ever existed. Here are my travels, which ain't much. In the Westward direction I've been to Dallas, Texas and Bloomfield, Missouri; in the Northward direction I've been to St. Louis, Missouri and Evansville, Indiana; in the Eastward directions I've been to Asheville, North Carolina; and in the Southward direction I've been to Rome, Georgia and Huntsville, Alabama. I have visited the following states in my life time. I live in Tennessee, of course, I've been in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and the very tip of Virginia at Bristol. All of this is just a mere FYI. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> 00:48, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>25 Your block of Bookofsecrets</p>
<p><br />
Please reconsider your block. Even though he recently scribbled a message from Merkey onto my user page, I really don't think Bookofsecrets is a sockpuppet of Merkey. I've interacted with both far more often than I like to think about. Bookofsecrets has his own trail of sockpuppets seperate from Merkey's which have in the past operated at cross purposes to Merkey. Bookofsecrets acknowledged his past use of sockpuppets, apologized for it and has since been reasonably well-behaved. He appears to me to be very gullible and his actions in behalf of Merkey, while misguided, are being done in good faith. — MediaMangler 13:53, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am in agreement with MediaMangler. I have been patiently interacting with Bookofsecrets since December under his various admitted sockpuppets, but never have I suspected him to be a sockpuppet of Waya Sahoni or Gadugi. (He has contributed under Bumpusmills1, WECoyote, and various IPs: 4.152.156.212, 4.152.180.67, 4.152.180.69, 4.152.183.226, 4.152.96.220, and 4.152.99.145) Though I'll admit that I can never be completely sure, I remember that when he first came to Wikipedia, he did not contribute to Native American articles, and had no knowledge of this entire "Merkey-related" situation. However, he is certaintly gullible, and seems to be eating out of Waya Sahoni's hand after his offer to help him "find his Native American roots."</p>
<p>He was not shy in revealing personal information on his user page when he first arrived at Wikipedia, and my enormous amounts of knowledge there does not correlate with the little I know about Waya Sahoni. If you'll look at the deleted edits at his user page at Bumpusmills1, you'll see that it was deleted after an individual began stalking him and his elderly parents in real life. Disgusting as this may have been, it helped persuade me of that Tennessee identity.</p>
<p>His personality is completely different as well. Though his own work is usually done in good faith, he consistently blows up at other editors, somehow taking everything in bad faith and blaming it on his "Cherokee [Indian] blood," which is the complete opposite of Waya Sahoni. Bookofsecrets changed British actor Ian Hart's page to reflect American spellings; a reversion led him to rant about a war between Britain and the United States. He placed images in Bumpus Mills, Tennessee, and lashed out when the article was Wikified. Waya Sahoni never openly behaved this irrationaly until the end. (Unless something happened under Gadugi; I don't know much about that) Finally, Bookofsecrets made edits to Cherokee society; when Waya Sahoni came in to take away supposed New Age Indian falsehoods, it took a frustratingly long time for Bookofsecrets to come around and accept his edits in good faith.</p>
<p>As a result, unless I see more evidence, I strongly doubt that the original individuals logged in as Bookofsecrets or Waya Sahoni are the same person. At the same time, I have no doubt that Bookofsecrets is blindly following Waya Sahoni. — Rebelguys2 talk 17:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also left at note at User talk:Friendly Neighbour. As further evidence of my doubts, Friendly Neighbour's list of Waya Sahoni's IP sockpuppets there do not correspond to the IP range of Bumpusmills1/WECoyote/Bookofsecrets' IP range. Thanks for your work here though; let me know if you need any more information. — Rebelguys2 talk 17:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bookofsecrets was originally a real person, that is nobody's sockpuppet. It seems he host interest in Wikipedia after the user he worshipped (Waya sahoni) was blocked as a sockpuppet of Jeff Merkey. Since then he has two bursts of activity. Both seems Merkey controlled. I have a suspicion that he was so gullible he gave his password to Merkey. His today's posting were clearly aimed at giving some credibility to Waya sahoni not being a sock of Merkey (while Merkey's recent activity seems to be the final confirmation that Waya sahoni is Merkey as the ban on Merkey allegedly affected status of Waya sahoni). I believe Bookofsecrets's "attestation" was a cheap trick which was supposed to open a door for Merkey to return to Wikipedia. (By the way, Waya sahoni was blocked also for legal threats so even if he were a separate person, he still should be kept blocked). To sum it up: I have no proof but I have a gut feeling that the recent activity of Bookofsecrets was at least Merkey inspired if not Merkey controlled. Friendly Neighbour 18:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's more than a gut-feeling - it's obvious that Bookofsecrets is under the influence of Waya Sahoni. However, Bookofsecrets' style of editing remains consistent with what I've seen in the past, and is unlike Waya Sahoni's. The reason for the recent decline in editing is because of Waya Sahoni's establishment of a separate Wiki. We must remember that these are not single purpose accounts we are talking about, and we shouldn't hand out indefinite bans just because two people happen to agree with one another, however misguided. — Rebelguys2 talk 18:55, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikigadugi is certainly not the reason why Bookofsecrets is not active here. He did not work on Wikigadugi in April (his Wikigadugi name is Red Bear). It seems Waya sahoni (the one from Wikigadugi who is certainly Merkey himself) deletes the Wikigadugi history from time to time. But you can compare Red Bear's Wikigadugi talk page and its archive (I give you a anonymized link because Jeff Merkey is know to use his web pages logs in his litigation threats) - the entries end in March. It is possibe that the archive will be deleted in minutes after I post this info, so please be quick.Friendly Neighbour 19:16, 21 April 2006 (UTC) Statement retracted. Friendly Neighbour 20:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Wikigadugi's records show that Bookofsecrets/Red Bear has made dozens of contributions to WikiGadugi over the month of April. [3] Regardless, I don't really care, becuase that's not the point. I'm not here to accuse Waya Sahoni of anything, I don't know enough to accuse Waya Sahoni of anything, I don't know who Merkey is, and I don't care. The point is that there is no evidence to accuse Bookofsecrets of being a sockpuppet, save for the fact that some people have a feeling that his last contributions here sounded like something Waya Sahoni would write, and I'm here to ask Jonathunder to reconsider his block on those grounds. — Rebelguys2 talk 19:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I retract my previous statement. You're probably right about the Wikigadugi stats but we are anyway in no position to know who-is-who on that server. Sorry for raising this topic. I accept the point that we cannot know for sure whether Bookofsecrets is operated by Merkey or not. But still, I would be afraid of the mayhem we'll bring on Wikipedia by unblocking the account if it's really operated now by Merkey. Friendly Neighbour 20:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can say with definite certainty that Donald Watkins II (aka User:Bookofsecrets) is not Jeff Merkey. I've dealt with this person before I ever knew who Merkey was. This user should have been blocked for a multitude of other reasons, but being a sockpuppet of Merkey is not one of them. It's just that Bookofsecrets is now a lackey of Merkey to such a degree that they are indistinguishable. --BWD (talk) 14:05, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I really don't think Bookofsecrets (talk • contribs) belongs on the list. His current behavior is still consistent with his past persona. Any attempt to describe that persona would, I'm afraid, look too much like a personal attack. Suffice it to say, he still looks like a victim of Merkey's deceptiveness. — MediaMangler 12:37, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may be right. But my nose has not mislead me so far. I'm simply keeping an eye on him in case I'm right. Friendly Neighbour 12:47, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've interacted with Bookofsecrets under his various sockpuppets since December, and never have I suspected him of being a sockpuppet of Waya Sahoni, and I have followed these two closely in the past. See my message to Jonathunder here. I will admit that Bookofsecrets seems to be eating out of Waya Sahoni's hand at the moment. I will also admit that I have no idea about what the issue with User:Gadugi was in the past, nor do I know why he was originally blocked; if it was bad, I understand the paranoia. Regardless, thanks for keeping an eye out. — Rebelguys2 talk 17:44, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I left a note at Jonathunder's talk page as well. I agree that Bookofsecrets was originally a real user. I suspect that presently his password is used by Merkey. By now I believe I can detect Merkey style after a few sentences and today's Bookofserets postings made all my alarm bells go wild. And believe me, I never before had this feeling about this user. BTW, I remember your star on Gadugi's page. I even wondered at one time if you were a real person&#160;:-) It seems one becomes paranoid on Wikipedia. Friendly Neighbour 18:21, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just wonder how Bookofsecrets can say one day "I can postively attest that Waya sahoni and Jeff Merkey are not the same person. I am acquainted with both and know that they are two totally different individuals" and the next "I have never personally met Jeff Merkey nor Waya sahoni face to face. ". If he lost his account simply because he lied, too bad for him. However, I'm still convinced that the two sentences were not written by the same person. Friendly Neighbour 05:32, 22 April 2006</p>

<p>Life is much too short for me to tolerate such pessimistic comments about my Cherokee brothers or myself. So I'm blocked, big deal. I can go elsewhere and paint an accurate picture of the Wikipedia Administrative Ilk <b>WAI</b> for the whole world to behold. I have not done so, but it can easily be done. It seems the aformentioned <b>WAI</b> take much pleasure in putting down anyone who does not agree with them 1000%. If the WAI expect me to agree with them 1000% they shall see ten feet of snow in the pits of hades before I'll do so. I don't expect others to fear me, but I do expect others to be courteous if at all possible. I was attempting to be courteous up until I ask a few simple harmless questions concerning one of my Cherokee brethren and made a few simple observational comments in addition to the questions. Jimbo Wales has challenges having his authority challenged by anyone, but especially Native Americans. I will challenge his authority and anyone else's simply because I'm a natural born anarchist. I'll fight the system, any system, if I see it is unethical, unjust, or oppressive in any way, shape or form. BTW I will watch and keep on watching. I do not trust certain individuals and I do not have to point fingers and call names. I know who I'm watching and for what reasons. Finally, This account on Wikipedia belongs to me Donald Ray "Red Bear" Watkins II of Bumpus Mills, Stewart County, Tennessee and no other.

<p>Please refrain from making personal attacks against any individuals. Many of us are trying to help you, knowing well that you are not a sockpuppet of Waya Sahoni.

<li>Rebelguys2. You have had dealings with me before. You know I rarely run from a fight(giggles). I appreciate your assistance. I am an Anarchist and always have been. It is not a personal attack.

<p>I have noted the evidence that this account was opened and at least originally used by someone other than Jeff Markey. It still appears to me, however, that this account was used to relay messages from a blocked user and carry on this blocked user's crusade in a disruptive way. If there is a committment from this user that this will not happen in the future, and if the excellent advice Rebelguys gives above is heeded here, I am willing to unblock this account now. If you simply want to continue to "fight" and if this anarchy includes disregard for Wikipedia policies, I don't see any advantage to the project in unblocking.
