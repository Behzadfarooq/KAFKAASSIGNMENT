<dd>I disagree the first paragraph states that in modern times other media has been burned. The famous Beatles record burning episode (After <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s bigger than <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> quote) included the burning of publicity material such as posters and books as well. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's OK, but if we say "targets for book burnings have included" we should list actual books. I have no problem including burning of other media, but perhaps that should be done in a separate list (can be in this article for the time being). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a></dd>

<p>One thing that would interest me: In Michael Hutchison's <i>Anatomy of Sex and Power</i>, the author states that the nazis burned Darwin's books. He doesn't cite a source, though. Can anyone confirm that? Do we have a list of the books burned by the nazis? --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In some religious groups, converts are encouraged to burn "heretical" or "satanic" books or other works in their possession from their lives prior to conversion. For instance, youths in America who convert to various sorts of fundamentalist Christianity have been encouraged to burn or otherwise destroy <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a> related hobby materials (tarot cards, ouija boards), <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_games.html" title="Role-playing games">role-playing games</a>, and nonreligious <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>. This is not the same as the public spectacle of book burning, though culturally it touches on many of the same themes. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a></p>
<p>We need to distinguish between forced and voluntary book burning. The Potter burnings, the one described in the Bible etc. are voluntary burnings. There were also voluntary comic book burnings in post-war Germany, instigated by the church (called "Schm√∂kergrab-Aktionen"). I'm not sure <i>how</i> voluntary these really were, though, since teachers at the time had quite some authority over children. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a></p>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>: US government burns the library of Dinshah Ghadiali:</i> The US had no authority to be burning the books of this well-known quack.</li>

<hr />
<p>I think there does need to be a statement that at least some people find the idea of book burning to be offensive. That it's found such on the grounds of book burning being censorship, or the connotation book burning has because of the Nazi book burnings, and the book burnings that occur today. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesster79_9510.html" title="User:Jesster79">JesseG</a> 23:44, Oct 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The more historical detail can be mustered in the entry, the more readers will come to that very conclusion on their own. Let the burnings speak for themselves. And let's not leave out the Christian book burnings of pagan literature and "heretical" material. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 02:05, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The destruction of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Reich_07b7.html" title="Wilhelm Reich">Wilhelm Reich</a>'s books and laboratory notes under court order is well-documented. I'm not sure whether it should be classed as a "book burning" in the sense described in this article, though. While his books and notes <i>were</i> in fact destroyed by burning, this was done by officers of the court in a trash incinerator. It was not a ritual for the public "edification" in the sense of Nazi book-burnings. <a href="http://pw2.netcom.com/~rogermw/Reich/book_burning.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pw2.netcom.com/~rogermw/Reich/book_burning.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Legally, Reich was in contempt of court; he had violated a court order to cease publishing his "orgone energy" writings. (This publication was condemned as practicing quack medicine.) Morally, a person who loves freedom may find it repulsive (and deserving of the term "book burning") <i>whenever</i> agents of government seize and destroy printed works belonging to a person who desires their publication.</p>
<p>So I can see three possible meanings of "book burning" here. Which one this article chooses to describe must control whether Reich's (or any other) works are considered "burned books":</p>
<ol>
<li>Any destruction by fire of printed matter, for the purpose of preventing its publication or dissemination.</li>
<li>Any public ritual of destruction by fire of printed matter, for the purpose of denouncing it.</li>
<li>Any objectionable destruction by fire of printed matter which is today regarded as valuable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, the third option is subjective and thus problematic for Wikipedia. I recommend one of the other two. ‚Äî<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:34, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The Satanic Verses, burnt by Muslims who considered it blasphemous</i></p>
<p><i>the Harry Potter books, burnt by some American Christians who considered them satanic</i></p>
<p>This angers me so much. Rowling was burnt by <i>some</i> Christians, while Rushdie was burnt simply by Muslims. Bias? Eurocentricisim? The only reason that I'm not <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">being bold</a> is that I'm finding myself more and more pissed at the media doing this and that I may not see an important factor that I otherwise might. So, I'm asking you people, is there any reason to keep it like it is? And if not, how do you think we should state it? Does the <i>some</i> clutter Wikipedia or do you think it makes it seem less biased? --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyss_f66e.html" title="User:Dyss">Dyss</a> 04:19, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC) (foaming)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here's an idea: Perhaps we should not list <i>any</i> case of book-burning which cannot be backed up by a reference documenting the following:
<ul>
<li>The works burned</li>
<li>The place and date of the burning</li>
<li>The persons responsible (individuals or official organizations -- not identity groups like "Christians" or "Muslims")</li>
<li>The stated motives, if attested</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The reference doesn't have to be linked in this article, if the specific act of book-burning is described in more detail in another Wikipedia article, such as <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serapeum.html" title="Serapeum">Serapeum</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonfire_of_the_Vanities_af31.html" title="Bonfire of the Vanities">Bonfire of the Vanities</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And we should not be making generalizations like "burned by Christians" or "burned by Muslims" or whatever, <i>even if</i> qualified with a weasel word like "some". There are many millions of Muslims in the world, most of whom have probably never been in any sort of contact with a copy of <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 14:56, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That might be a good idea, you have my support for it, but I can see a few problems with it:
<ul>
<li>Some of these happened so long ago that reliable data on them might simply be impossible to find now. The Bible quote, the Sibylline Books, Qin Shi Huang's orders. If the book burning was a good example but simply to old to have a (reliable) date pinned it shouldn't go I think.</li>
<li>The big one: if we cannot call them Christians, Muslims etc. what CAN we call them? Don't get me wrong, I think making generalizations is very harmful to the Wikipedia, but in some cases this might be problematic. If we can say "People belonging to this-or-that religious sect" or "followers of religious leader Bob" or even "inhabitants of this town", that would be ideal of course. I'm definately going to try to pin some <i>names</i> on these. But this might not always be possible.</li>
</ul>

<dd><i>The works of Jewish authors and other "degenerate" books were burned by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This one will be quite hard. There is not one single incident, the term Nazis is quite vague (I can imagine some citizens joined in the burnings without being Nazis) and there are no books listed. This one could probably either be removed or meged with the one below it (which gives a group, date and examples of works burned) but the last two might be especially problematic. I'm not sure if Khomeini was the person who called for people to do this, but if that was so a air way to put it, in my eyes, would be "On xxxx Khomeini called all Muslims to burn copies of TSV. On place x, y and z a massive burning happened soon thereafter" (I'm making this stuff up, I'll go see if I can find some information after this).</dd>
<dd>But what if we can not find a specific group that burned it but we only find a lot of smaller ones? Let's say that a variety of Christian groups decided that HP was diabolic? Of course we would not want to pin it on all Christians. What do we do in this case?</dd>
<dd>I'm going to see if I can associate some names with incidents now. Thanks for your help and I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds these generalizations problematic. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyss_f66e.html" title="User:Dyss">Dyss</a> 22:04, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even in the case of the Nazi book burnings, we should be able to come up with <i>some</i> names and dates. However, I agree with you that my criteria above are overstated ... I suspect that actions taken on the part of a government or political party, as part of a stated policy that is known to history, can be attributed as such rather than (e.g.) needing exact dates of Nazi book-burnings. Of course it would be <i>nice</i> to have exact dates for major burnings, and I think we can:</dd>

<p>I removed the following description of book burning, regarding digital media. Regardless of content, the wording was vague and misleading. For example, "it can be thought of as book burning". Breakfast cereal <b>can</b> be thought of as rocket fuel, but that does not make it so.</p>
<p>The deletion of any type content is <b>not</b> considered book burning. This application of the term is laughable when compared to the Nazi book burnings or any number of other historical incidents. I don't want to be mean, but if someone stops hosting your blog that is <b>not</b> book burning. In fact, by this definition, every time someone alters a Wikipedia article they are guilty of "book burning". Also, destroying evidence is simply a misapplication of the term.</p>
<p>I agree with the last sentence. The rest, I've rewritten to be, in my opinion, more accurate.</p>
<p>Having said that, I believe that digital book burning is a very serious and very important issue. The ease with which media can be distributed over the Internet makes the systematic purging of that media possible as well. Technologies such as digital rights management attempt to stem the distribution but not the deletion of works, presenting the opportunity for repression of ideas. Also, if content can be deleted but never copied, then it is almost assured that the content will no longer exist at some point. This is not quite book burning, but raises interesting questions along the same lines of thought.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The current trend of digital communications and archiving has resulted in cataloging of written works on digital media. When these works are destroyed by deletion or purposeful purging of these works, it can be thought of as book burning. Some modern examples of this are: deletions of nodes by people other than their authors on web sites such as Everything2, the deletion of archived emails and data when trying to hide evidence. Book burning is the destruction of written works whether the medium of destruction used is fire or deletion."</p>

<p>"Established beliefs of Epicurus was burned in a Paphlagonian marketplace by order of the charlatan Alexander, supposed prophet of Ascapius ca 160 (Lucian, Alexander the false prophet)"</p>
<p>The use of "charlatan" and "supposed prophet" seem point-of-view to me, and should be deleted, unless the whole is a quote, which I doubt. 82.176.202.214 13:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If one doesn't understand that Alexander, posing as a prophet of Asculapius, is indeed a charlatan, perhaps one hasn't fully grasped Lucian's satiric essay. I wonder whether the expression "POV" isn't quite grasped either. Lucian's narrative is not meant to be taken as the <i>gospel truth</i>, however, and this article is meant to instance actual book burnings. The detail in Lucian's tale is meant to have verisimilitude: the burning of texts in public must have been a familiar trope to Lucian's readers and hearers. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 03:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that Book Burning is acceptable in SOME circumstances, after all a book is just Leather and paper,it is the text of a book the words themselves rather than their format. i find that the burning of evil books (in my view) such as the Da vinchi code and other such works which undermine everything that people hold dear is right and should be carried out, but the burning of Philosophical works which are unbiased is wrong. may i give a fictional account now, if a book was published which was morally wrong and features pages and pages of pure filth, graphic violence sex and so on i would get my friends together and burn hundreds of copies of that book to show our discust to its evil content and that in my view is a good thing, but to burn works of great importance to society such as the works of shakespeare or the dialogues of plato is a bad thing. now your comments please-Ted Barlow</p>

<dd>Basically, it is not books which are burnt, it is ideas. And this is done by those in adequate power to suppress the rise of suspected opposition. But most of these acts are undertaken without the knowledge of anyone else. When a race is to be erased even the knowledge of its existence is not to be spared.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other hand, most of the events we know of have being made of public knowledge solely for the purpose of expressing discontent, disapproval and to bring to limelight an organization that fears the fall of its popularity/notoriety rating below "acceptable" levels. An auxiliary purpose, evident in many past occurrences especially of lately - due to media suppport-, is as an inexpensive, albeit rather effective, instrument of initiating violent riots and mass genocides between rivaling, usually extremist, groups in particularly in third world and under-developed nations and societies that have no effective machineries for secular education. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_92e1.html" title="User:Light">Light</a></p>
