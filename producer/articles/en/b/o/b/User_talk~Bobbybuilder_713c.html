<dd>Clearly, you are taking way to much offense to these edits. DPPs platform is a very moderate platform, unlike KMT's communist-leaning agenda. Perhaps you are trying to tote the "Party-Line" to appease your comrades, but Wikipedia, like the DPP is democratic.

<p>Bobby, please also note that there is a three-revert rule that you have violated. Please adhere.--GrandCru 29 June 2005 03:46 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I've notice the revert wars ongoing on the 2 articles, and I was wondering if some middle ground can be reached between you and GrandCru. I am willing to help only if it can be done peacefully. Please also note that both of you have violated the 3RR rule. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenwhale_84fe.html" title="User:Penwhale">Penwhale</a> 29 June 2005 08:37 (UTC)</p>

That was a major error, because his statement cannot explain the "Chinese civil war". it's like knowing the history Crusader War and yet insisting "Christianity is pro-Muslin". I don't believe there is a middle ground for this matter, not because he cries the loudest so he can put whatever he wants in the page.</dd>

<dd>KMT may not be pro-communist, I agree. I, however, contend that they are communist-leaning. There are many KMT here who believe that to merge back with China would be to give up democracy and fall back under communist rule. While there are clearly benefits to this, such as access to weapons, there are also potential problems such as receiving false, governemnt sanctioned news, etc.--KentingKid 02:55, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with your edit removing the "fake" comment from the Chinese Patriotic Church article, but I don't think it should have been labelled as "vandalism". It was sort of POV, sure; but arguably true, and (I don't think) was meant as name-calling or damage to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFrjwoolley_64f8.html" title="User:Frjwoolley">Frjwoolley</a> 14:00, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think it's tolerable to fabricate information. He chose to say "Vatican claimed it's fake", that's beyond POV. That's damaging to that Patriotic Church (which I don't care much) and also the Vatican. It's like I want to say a lots of religions are cult, that doesn't mean I can go around and add "Vatican says this and that are fake religions". <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">Bobbybuilder</a> 21:19, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I don't disagree with your assessment of LTH's agenda, I think seperatist is a little too POV in that it implies the POV that Taiwan is part of China. Consider also that nations seperate from China also share some elements of Chinese culture (i.e. Singapore), were they to adopt a similar desinicization policy it would certainly not be characterized as seperatist. Might I suggest "<a href="../../../d/e/s/Desinicization.html" title="Desinicization">Desinicization</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/o/c/Localization.html" title="Localization">Localization</a>" as more neutral alternatives?.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 4 July 2005 05:01 (UTC)

<dd>I think your edits on KMT are slightly biased. Do you feel this is appropriate?--KentingKid 02:51, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hate to point this out but we both know Taiwan is not an independent country and we are still just a part of the ROC, so it's still PC to say Taiwan is part of China, just the interpretation of the word "China" is different. (一中各表)</dd>
<dd>Anyway, back to your last suggestion. I don't think New Party was against localisation, 'cos even Chiang Ching-kuo was pushing for localisation, but it was not comfortable with the desincisation movement Lee was pushing. I would prefer to use the term "desinicisation" in that page, as it bears more negative connotation and makes KMT's split up more reasonable. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">Bobby</a> 4 July 2005 12:01 (UTC)

<dd>I am somewhat concered by your use of the term "makes KMT's split up more reasonable", remember, we're not trying to justify anything to anyone here. Our goal is to present the facts in an impartial manner regardless of whose favor it's in. Anyhow, the term "Desinicization" works for me, though remember, what you said can also be interpreted as Two Chinas.</dd>
<dd>I am very reluctant to get into a political debate on this as prior experience shows that it inevitably degenerates into a mutual edit war to the detriment of Wikipedia as a whole. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 4 July 2005 18:33 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As long as we do not recognise both ROC and PRC at the same time, I doubt there's any room for Two Chinas. I was pointing out that if New Party was not comfortable with localisation, they would leave KMT when Chiang was the leader and not until several years into Lee's reign. The new thing introduced by Lee was "desinicisation", so we should be able to pin-point the reason to that. That was what I meant by "reasonable". Anyway, thanks for the editing.--<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">Bobby</a> 4 July 2005 20:25 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello again, I'd like to notify you that in light of the criticisms sections posted on other ROC political party pages, I have also included one on the KMT page to avoid imbalance. I'd like to enlist your help in including the KMT POV as rebuttels to maintain balance. Personally if it were up to me I wouldn't include criticisms on any of the party pages as they run the risk of turning into soap boxes, however I do realize that some believe them to be appropriate. Thanks. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 8 July 2005 04:08 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's see, the idiotic attempt to link Shanghai with Prostitution, glorify Japanese war crime, remove the Chinese link from the Jacque Gracq page, add illogical sentences into the Mainlander page, adding irrelevant link into the KMT page, then after the warning, all the sudden someone came up and use YOUR writing style, YOUR poor grammatical structure and YOUR pathetic innuendo, and that person just happen to look for all the people YOU called for help before. yeah, it's not you. whatever.

<p>No problem, always happy to help whack a vandal. The dynamic IP's are becoming a major problem on all sorts of articles. There's some debate going on over whether we should stop anon contributations all together to stop casual vandals, though the downside is that may also discourage casual contributers.
