	    <p>You've made a lot re-linking from Great Britain to United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I wonder somewhat about your reasons in respect to the historical context.</p>
<p>For me (who is no native speaker of English), the United Kingdom is a political entity with rather narrow time-scope, and <s>the Britannic island</s> Britain is a geographical entity with eternal time-scope.</p>
<p>Particularly your change in the article on <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> makes me wonder how you think, but not only that.</p>

<dd>Yes, be careful with historical pages: as <i>political entities</i> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> didn't exist until 1801, nor <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> until 1707 (of course the <i>island of Great Britain</i> has existed since the English Channel flooded after the last ice age). Common usage has lagged a long way behind the political theory. I don't think you'd see "United Kingdom" used outside of very formal contexts until very recently. It imparts a strange flavour to a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>-era article to use "United Kingdom". <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 11:34, 2004 Apr 20 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't regard old usage as a reason to maintain incorrect terminology. Thus if an article says that <i>Great Britain entered the war in 1914</i>, it is not accurate and should be changed to either <i>the United Kingdom</i> or <i>Britain</i>. It sounds to me like you are voting for <i>Britain</i> rather than <i>United Kingdom</i>. I note that point and agree with you.<br />

<dd>I think that would be a good idea. Remember that direct translations of "Great Britain" are common in many languages on the European continent, but without the meaning you argue for as the one and only correct&#160;;-) — why Great Britain is likely to continue to emerge in edits by contributors with other mother tongues and nationalities than the English.<br />

<dd>I think formal use of UK is very recent, hence the Olympic team of Great Britain, the GB car sticker etc.. I'd even go so far as to say that the use of UK has increased dramatically since the rise of the Internet and the .uk suffix. I think many people still use GB rather than UK when adressing envelopes. So whilst technically UK is correct as a shorthand for the current political entity and and GB is not, I think that the use of GB in text should not be expunged entirely when the context relates to it's former usage even if technically incorrect. What GB links to is another matter as I mentioned in my comment below. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a></dd>

<p>I agree that Great Britain probably shouldn't be used, but why not use "Britain" instead of the "United Kingdom"? I've rolled back a few of your changes, but perhaps you'd be willing to (mostly) change them to "Britain" instead? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 16:22, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read your comments on John's page. I think you should look at the context of what you are changing more clearly, when you decide that Great Britain should be expunged. You mention something about causing offence by using Great Britain in contrast to lesser Britain, because it is linked with the language of terrorism. I have no idea what this is meant to mean. Great Britain means the island of Great Britain as opposed to little Britain or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a>. In French these two places are known as <i>Grande Bretagne</i> and <i>Bretagne</i>. Great Britain does not mean "Britain is Great". I should also point out that in the Olympics teams from the United Kingdom compete as "Great Britain" with GB stamped on their vests. For the most part I don't think it is wrong to have the words Great Britain used in relation to the UK unless we are talking about a link. In this case for the most part the articles should use [[United Kingdom]] or [[United Kingdom|Britain]] or [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] as appropriate to the context. I think that John was wrong to revert on at least one of your edits (I haven't seen all that has gone on here) but in the case of <a href="../../../w/a/f/Waffen-SS_9ed7.html" title="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>, when it was pointing to [[Great Britain]] it was wrong, the change to [[United Kingdom]] was correct as we are clearly talking about the country, but the change to [[Britain]] is clearly wrong because that page in fact more of a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 15:21, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreement here. There are times where 'Great Britain' is the correct wording. 'Great Britain' is the name of the largest of the British Isles, for one thing, and when <i>that particular island</i> is what is being talked about, then it is the correct term. For example, the recent moving of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain_bbef.html" title="Rail transport in Great Britain">Rail transport in Great Britain</a> to <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_the_United_Kingdom_057d.html" title="Rail transport in the United Kingdom">Rail transport in the United Kingdom</a> was incorrect, since the article WAS about rail transport on the <i>geographical</i> entity of Great Britain. I agree that Great Britain is the incorrect term to use for the modern state when it is the nation / political entity that is being talked about, though it IS in wide use. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 21:28, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why change Great Britain to Britain? Great Britain is the official name used in the full name of the United Kingdom, isn't it? If what was meant was that Mireille Mathieu (or others) toured England, Scotland or Wales, wasn't it ok? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 12:05, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

Please do not think that every single instance of Great Britain is automatically wrong. On the Cornwall page it was talking about the Cornish penninsular on the island of [[[Great Briain]]. On the Olympic page the UK competes as Great Britain, not United Kingdom. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_license_plate_code.html" title="International license plate code">International license plate code</a> for the UK is GB.

You changed the <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty.html" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a> for the second time and it has been reverted for a second time, because Great Britain is correct.

<dd>I certainly did not intend to do a second edit and I do not wish to get into an edit war. That was a mistake but it probably occurred simply because it came up in the search list and I see that the United Kingdom is a reasonable term in that text. Yes, the United Kingdom did not exist in 1747. However, the text was: <i>The last act of amnesty passed in Great Britain ...</i> and that phrase is also true if you use the term 'United Kingdom'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have tried to make note of previous conversations on this topic, i.e. that the use the term UK is fairly recent. It seems that many Wikipedia authors/editors default to using the term Great Britain. I don't know why. British nationals do not generally default to that term, they will generally say 'Britain' by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is why I have used the term 'Britain' in many cases. An analogy might be if we kept on referring to the <i>Contiguous USA</i> or the <i>48 States</i>. In many cases it would be correct (e.g. <i>Tony Blair visited the Contiguous USA and spoke to Congress</i> would be technically correct), or sometimes merely a matter of interpretation, but in many other cases it would be wrong. It would be much better if people stopped thinking of the default term as <i>Great Britain</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have fixed a lot of errors. You have been kind enough on more than one occasion to draw my attention to the few cases where you think there was no error. I hope you will agree that many of the uses of Great Britain were wholly wrong. You may believe that I have a high error rate, but if more than 50% of my edits are correct, then my intervention is worthwhile for Wikipedia as a whole. Certainly all my interventions are well intended. My intention is to be 100% correct but perhaps the percentage is only in the 90's. You may estimate it as lower. I will try to be even more cautious.</dd>

I do not consider the use of Great Britain as a synonym of the UK wholly wrong even in the modern context. Plenty of people have no problem with the use of GB as a synonym of UK. You give an example using "contiguous USA". A better analogy is the use of "America" to mean the USA. It is technically incorrect to use the term the "American President", for two reasons, a) The continental USA does not encompass the entire continent of the America and b) the state of Hawaii isn't even in the Americas. And yet the term American president is used all over the place. I see you wish to expunge it completely (and I mean no offense) as pedantry. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 19:45, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Great Britain and Northern Ireland together make up the United Kingdom...The best thing that can be said for "British" is that it is not quite as misleading as "American", but it is nevertheless the established term for "relating to the UK".... So what about "Britain"? This is not a term with any legal meaning, but if you ask the English person in the street what country they live in surveys show that more will answer "Britain" than anything else. So it should probably be taken as a back-formation from "British", and therefore to mean "United Kingdom".</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Used by cartographers to denote the biggest of the British Isles, containing most but not all of England, Wales and Scotland. The usage goes back to Roman times ("Britannia Major", distinguished from "Britannia Minor", ie Brittany). It also forms part of the official title of the United Kingdom, in which case it means the political entities of England, Scotland, Wales, including the offshore islands which belong to those countries. Because of the possible confusion between these two usages, "the British mainland" has been suggested as the least ambiguous term for the major island itself.</dd>

<dd>Thus casual references to the country, the government or the people should default to Britain or United Kingdom.

However, you appear to be specifically objecting to the use of 'UK' and 'Britain'. That is what I can't yet understand. Perhaps the references that I have just quoted are of interest.</dd>

<p>Just to pile on, changing it in stamp-related articles goes against the longstanding convention of calling the country "Great Britain", which is followed even by UK collectors (take a look at the webpages of the #1 British dealer <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Gibbons_e1a2.html" title="Stanley Gibbons">Stanley Gibbons</a>, for instance <a href="http://www.stanleygibbons.com/stamps/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stanleygibbons.com/stamps/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>).

<p>This is becomming tiresome. Prime Miniter of Great Britain is CORRECT for periods before 1801.

<dd>To Mintguy. If you use 'Great Britain' and 'United Kingdom', then you have two different types of references and in the case of William Pitt, you must use both. It would not be so bad if this was applied consistently but the sad fact is that throughout Wikipedia references to the country are frequently wrong. All Prime Ministers can be correctly described as British so that is what I was implementing. If you notice, all links that say 'Prime Minister of Great Britain' redirect to 'Prime Minister of United Kingdom' anyway, so I was also correcting the links to avoid the redirect. A similar redirect happens with 'Military of Great Britain' (which was an incorrect 20th century reference that I put right).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So describing all Prime Ministers as 'British' is a universally applicable approach that avoids having two different types of references. Describing Winston Churchill as a Prime Minister of Great Britain is wrong, and describing one of the Iraq coalition members as Great Britain is wrong. I do not know why you are so hostile to the words 'Britain' and 'British'.<br /></dd>

<p>Describing Winston Churchill as a Prime Minister of Great Britain is not wrong, it may be described as inaccurate. Much like describing George W. Bush as President of America. Specifically regarding Pitt the Younger, you changed it from <font color="blue">'''William Pitt the Younger''' ([[May 28]], [[1759]] - [[January 23]], [[1806]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[politician]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] from [[1783]] to [[1801]] and of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from [[1804]] until his death in 1806."</font> to <font color="red">'''William Pitt the Younger''' ([[May 28]], [[1759]] - [[January 23]], [[1806]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[politician]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] from [[1783]] to [[1801]] and of the [[United Kingdom]] from [[1804]] until his death in 1806.</font> You thereby destroyed the correct links to the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> and ended up with the article stating in garbled English <b>"Pit ... was a politician ... and British Prime Minister from 1783 to 1801 and of the United Kingdom from 1804 until his death in 1806."</b> I am not hostile to British of Britain, but you appear to be hostile to Great Britain when it is being used quite correctly. The vast majority of the edits you have made in the last 24 hours in this crusade to rid wikipedia of the words "Great Britain" have been wrong. another example being <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_car_number_plates.html" title="British car number plates">British car number plates</a>.

<dl>
<dd>We have a point of agreement. You say that Churchill as a <i>Prime Minister of Great Britain</i> is inaccurate. I agree. However, the term <i>British Prime Minister</i> is accurate and universal to <i>all</i> Prime Ministers. That was why I changed such inaccurate references to accurate references. I also updated the links to avoid redirects.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As far is William Pitt is concerned, the last bit should have said [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] from [[1783]] to [[1801]] and from [[1804]] until his death in 1806.. That seems much clearer.</dd>

<p>I am asking the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not change all references to Great Britain for the sake of it, or because the phrase "Great Britain" offends your eye or something.</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain which refer to the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> that existed between 1707 and 1801. The use of Great Britain in this context is ENTIRELY correct and should not be changed. (These are the majority of incorrect changes that you have made today and which I had to revert myself because you carried on doing so after I had left a message on your talk page).</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the article is talking about the island of Great Britain. The use of Great Britain in this context is ENTIRELY correct and should not be changed. (An example is the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> article)</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the article is talking about the nations of the United Kingdom exclusive of Northern Ireland (such as in the article about license plates in GB).</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the article is talking about cultural matters not directly related to the nation state. (There are several articles which you changed refer to Ireland (the island) and Great Britain (the island)) and not the Republic of Ireland and the UK.</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the article is talking about the nations that exist on the island of Great Britain and is purposely excluding Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the term is being used by an organisation even though it may be technically incorrect (for example the <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_Club_of_Great_Britain_f38a.html" title="Ski Club of Great Britain">Ski Club of Great Britain</a> also represents Northern Ireland and the Gaming Board for Great Britain regulates in Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain where it is used (as opposed to UK) by participants or experts in that particular field. Stan Shebs gives a good example here with its use by stamp collectors.</li>
<li>Do not change references to Great Britain when the use of GB has official sanctioning (such as the GB licence plate of the Great Britain Olympic team).</li>

<dd>Thank you for being specific. That is quite a lot of prohibitions, I will try to examine each point in detail and respond later. To help me get going, can you clarify some general points:
<ul>
<li>When you say 'do not change', I presume that you mean Great Britain -&gt; United Kingdom. There are many cases where the text is, or should be, a general reference to the nation, culture or people, perhaps over a length of time. What is your position on the use of the term 'Britain'? For example saying <i>William Pitt and Winston Churchill were both British Prime Ministers</i> or <i>the British Army has fought in France on many occasions</i></li>
<li>Of all the changes that I have done, are any that you think are good, accept or tolerate?</li>
<li>I presume that you are not 100% against the use of the terms Britain or United Kingdom. Are you willing to define the circumstances where you think they are better, acceptable, or merely tolerable?</li>

<p>Just to mention something which I can't see explicitly referred to in the extensive discussion above&#160;;) The term 'Great Britain' still has a perfectly valid current meaning. It refers to the combination of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst the term 'United Kingdom' also includes Northern Ireland. GB is still used in various government statistics etc. In very many cases it may be valid to say such-and-such is a place in Great Britain. It could equally well be stated that it is in the United Kingdom...or the European Union....or Europe....etc. So, anyway, I just wanted to make the point that in many cases either option is likely to be 'correct'. <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazzy_beb5.html" title="User:Mazzy">Mazzy</a> 15:42, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please check your facts before changing Great Britain to UK in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">bird</a> articles - several of the species you changed have only occurred in GB, and have never occurred in Northern Ireland. The recording units for birds are Britain and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, including Northern ireland, so all your changes are inappropriate unless you have checked against an Irish list.

<dd>Oh man, the old GB versus UK debate again. I can understand people's annoyance at the issue but given that UK and GB mean different entities it is extremely important to use the right term in the right context, depending on whether on is talking about GB (Scotland, Wales + England) or the United Kingdom (Scotland, Wales, England + Northern Ireland). The problem on wikipedia is that some people who don't realise that GB and UK are different, with GB either being an earlier kingdom that existed until 1801 or a subset of the UK, using them interchangably. It is like using <i>Ireland</i> when you actually mean <i>Northern Ireland</i> or the <i>Republic of Ireland</i>, or <i>Germany</i> when referring to <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Germany_0033.html" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> prior to unification. An encyclopaedia has to be clinically precise in its use of language, so that it is crystal clear in all contexts what is being talked about, especially for users who do not have background knowledge to allow them to know that when you said GB you really were talking about the UK. So using <i>England</i> for <i>Great Britain</i>, or <i>Great Britain</i> when you mean the <i>United Kingdom</i> is an elementary error. <i>Britain</i> is a tolerable, though scarcely accurate middle ground.<a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearEireann</a></dd>

<p>While I agree with your "leave for 7 days" theory for the majority of wikipedia articles, I believe <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> was right when he said that it should not apply to high-volume articles such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Wikipedia%7EMost_referenced_articles_0114.html" title="Wikipedia:Most referenced articles">fourth most linked article</a> on wikipedia]]. Looking at the history, you have reverted its deletion 3 or 4 times in the last day, and every time someone has again removed it. It is clear that your ideas are opposed and are extrememly unlikely to gain support - for the sake of everyone just back down and accept democracy.

<dd>Thank you for your comments here. A debate on early tag removal would have been welcome. Unfortunately, the first removal of the tag started 1.5 days from when it was added. I think 1.5 days is not a reasonable length of time. Removal by stealth and by making false statements like 'debate petered out' is wrong. Just because editors did not like ideas different to theirs does not mean that they should prevent other Wikipedia readers from engaging in it.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know why people are so upset about this issue, if they count 7 days from when the tag was put there, or 1 day from the last comment, it is not such a long time for them to wait.</dd>

<dd>I totally agree that removal by stealth and false statements are useless, but all said and done it has been around 5 days since you first introduced the tag, and on the basis of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> being one of the highest-volume aricles on Wikipedia, I think it would be fair to say that an extremely significant number of people have seen it. Indeed, a significant number have commented on it. I do not condone anyone prematurely removing the tag without due debate, but I can also see that you are fighting a losing battle and there is little or no point delaying the inevitable. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi">Deano</a> 20:56, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your further response. I appreciate it. The debate on the talk page seemed reasonable. I was genuine in the debate and I believe others are too. So I was quite surprised to encounter hostility to the tag itself. I made an open comment about a 7 tag expiry period in the talk page but it was not challenged there. The fact that early aggression has continued for days till nearly the reasonable deadline does not make changing the deadline more palatable. I agree that I am fighting a losing battle. I am glad that you have said that you do not condone premature removal. It would be nice if you or anyone else made that point on the talk page. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 21:59, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lay off the wholesale changing of "Great Britain" or "Britain" to "United Kingdom". The current "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" is a recent development, and doesn't apply to things back in 1816 or whenever. There was, before the current U.K.G.B.N.I. a "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"--go look up dates of both "United Kingdoms". <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:51, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I am aware, the edits that I have made are fully in line with the history, politics and geography of the terms.

<dd>Your view of history, politics, etc.—maybe. A few things to keep in mind.
<ul>
<li>If you link to United Kingdom, it damn sure better not be equally applicable to Ireland.</li>
<li>It most likely should have something to do with the governmental entity--and as someone else has pointed out in your archived discussion which I looked at after entering my comment here, "Great Britain" isn't necessarily incorrect even when it is. So, according to general Wikipedia philosophy, you should let it lie unless you have a pretty good reason for changing it. By all means, feel free to use "United Kingdom" in your own writing in this contest—just don't be so free and loose with other people's usage.</li>
<li>The opening statement of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingom_b038.html" title="United Kingom">United Kingom</a> article says it deals with the <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b>. If you want to make a reference to an earlier <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and</i> <i><b>Ireland</b></i>, specify it. (IMHO, there rarely would be any good reason for doing so.)</li>
<li>A little vagueness isn't necessarily a bad thing.</li>
<li>For a specific example, see my changes in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> (just going from memory, I think that one fits). <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:33, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
