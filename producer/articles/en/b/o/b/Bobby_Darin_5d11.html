<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Darin_5d11.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Darin was born to a poor working-class family in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx%2C_New_York_ae83.html" title="The Bronx, New York">The Bronx, New York</a>. His <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> father disappeared a few months before he was born at the height of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. He once remarked that "my crib was a cardboard box, later a dresser drawer". As a result, his mother, a <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayflower.html" title="Mayflower">Mayflower</a> descendant (half Italian, half <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a>), had to accept public assistance to take care of her infant son. It was not until he was an adult that he learned that the woman he thought to be his sister Nina, 19 years his senior, was in fact his mother and the woman he thought to be his mother was in fact his grandmother. The identity of his father was never publicly or privately disclosed. His mother refused to reveal that information even to him. He went to his death without knowing the identity of his birth father.</p>
<p>Frail as an infant, perhaps from the <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a> that resulted in a lack of proper <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_%28nutrition%29.html" title="Diet (nutrition)">diet</a> and medical attention, at the age of 8 he was stricken with multiple bouts of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheumatic_fever.html" title="Rheumatic fever">rheumatic fever</a>. The illness left him with a seriously diseased heart, and he lived with the constant knowledge that his life might be a short one: as a child he had overheard a doctor tell his mother he would be lucky to reach the age of 16. Driven by his poverty and illness, and with an innate talent for <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, by the time he was a teenager he could play several instruments, including piano, drums and guitar. He later added harmonica and xylophone.</p>
<p>An outstanding student, with a genius-level <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_560e.html" title="IQ">IQ</a>, Darin graduated from the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_High_School_of_Science_ac4d.html" title="Bronx High School of Science">Bronx High School of Science</a> and then attended <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_College_78be.html" title="Hunter College">Hunter College</a> on a scholarship. Wanting a career in the New York theater, he left college to play small nightclubs around the city with a musical combo. In the resort area of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catskill_Mountains_a8d8.html" title="Catskill Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a>, he was both a bus boy and an entertainer.</p>
<p>As was common with ethnic minorities at the time, he changed his Italian name to one that sounded more "American". He allegedly chose the name "Bobby Darin" because he had generally been called Bobby as a child (some called him "Waldo", a version of his first name) and because he had seen a malfunctioning sign at a Chinese restaurant reading "DARIN DUCK" rather than the intended "MANDARIN DUCK" and thought the "Darin" looked good. Later this story was modified, as he said on one occasion that the name was randomly picked out of the telephone book. Neither story has been verified.</p>

<p>In 1956 his agent negotiated a contract for him with <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decca_Records_8e99.html" title="Decca Records">Decca Records</a>, where <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_%26_His_Comets_bb6c.html" title="Bill Haley &amp; His Comets">Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a> had risen to fame. However, this was a time when rock and roll was still in its infancy and the number of capable record producers and arrangers in the field was extremely limited. Like other performers, Darin was at first pigeon-holed, recording the banal songs popular with record executives at the time.</p>
<p>He left Decca to sign with ATCO Records, where he wrote and arranged music for himself and others. There, after three mediocre recordings, his career took off in 1958 when he wrote and recorded his unique song "Splish Splash"; it became an instant hit, selling more than a million copies. ("Splish Splash" was written with DJ <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_the_K_028f.html" title="Murray the K">Murray the K</a> who bet that Darin could not write a song that started out with the words, "Splish Splash, I was takin' a bath", as suggested by Murray's mother; they eventually shared writing credits with her.) This was followed by more hits recorded in the same successful style.</p>
<p>In 1959, Bobby Darin recorded "Dream Lover", a ballad that became a multi-million seller. With financial success came the ability to demand more creative control, despite the objections of many people around him. His next record, "<a href="../../../m/a/c/Mack_the_Knife_33f6.html" title="Mack the Knife">Mack the Knife</a>", was the classic standard from <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Weill_0641.html" title="Kurt Weill">Kurt Weill</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Threepenny_Opera_c5b3.html" title="The Threepenny Opera">Threepenny Opera</a></i>. Darin gave the tune a vamping jazz-pop interpretation. The song went to No. 1 on the charts, sold several million copies and won the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year_f33c.html" title="Grammy Award for Record of the Year">Grammy Award for Record of the Year</a> at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Awards_of_1960_f40e.html" title="Grammy Awards of 1960">Grammy Awards of 1960</a>. Darin was also voted the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist_db80.html" title="Grammy Award for Best New Artist">Grammy Award for Best New Artist</a> that year. "Mack The Knife" has since been honored with a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame_Award_7d4a.html" title="Grammy Hall of Fame Award">Grammy Hall of Fame Award</a>. He followed "Mack" with "<a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyond_the_Sea_%28song%29_e141.html" title="Beyond the Sea (song)">Beyond the Sea</a>", a jazzy English-language version of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Trenet_984b.html" title="Charles Trenet">Charles Trenet</a>'s French hit song "<a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Mer_6a35.html" title="La Mer">La Mer</a>", which became another big hit for him.</p>
<p>During this time he became one of the hottest nightclub performers around, propelled by the success of "Mack the Knife" and "Beyond the Sea". Bobby set all-time attendance records at the famed <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copacabana_%28nightclub%29.html" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a> nightclub in NYC where it was not unusual for fans to line up all the way around the block to get tickets. The Copa sold so many seats to Bobby's shows there that they had to fill the dance floor (normally part of the performance area) with extra seating, leaving Bobby with a relatively small (approx. six feet deep and 12-14 feet wide) stage on which to perform. Darin also headlined at the major casinos in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>, the youngest performer to do so.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in bringing up new talent â€” <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Pryor_942f.html" title="Richard Pryor">Richard Pryor</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flip_Wilson_44e2.html" title="Flip Wilson">Flip Wilson</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Newton_b0ac.html" title="Wayne Newton">Wayne Newton</a> opened his night club performances when they were virtually unknown. Early on, at the Copacabana, he insisted that black comic <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipsey_Russell_450b.html" title="Nipsey Russell">Nipsey Russell</a> be his opening act. This was a very hard sell in the era of nightclub segregation, but perhaps because Darin had set the attendance mark (eclipsing <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>), his request was grudgingly granted by Jules Podell, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a> (mob boss) manager of the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copacabana_%28nightclub%29.html" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Darin also owned and operated a highly successful music publishing and production company (TM Music/Trio) which was responsible for many hit records including "Under The Boardwalk" and "Good Lovin." He 'discovered' <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Newton_b0ac.html" title="Wayne Newton">Wayne Newton</a> and signed him to TM, giving him a song that was originally sent to Darin to record; and that record went on to become Newton's breakout hit "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danke_Schoen_2b60.html" title="Danke Schoen">Danke Schoen</a>". He also was a mentor to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_McGuinn_e636.html" title="Roger McGuinn">Roger McGuinn</a>, who worked for Darin at TM Music before going off to form <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Byrds_72ba.html" title="The Byrds">The Byrds</a>. Darin also produced <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_Grier_6c3f.html" title="Roosevelt Grier">Rosey Grier</a>'s 1964 LP <i>Soul City</i>. And "Made in the Shade" for Jimmy Boyd.</p>

<p>In addition to music, Darin turned his attention to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_picture.html" title="Motion picture">motion pictures</a>. In 1960, he was the only actor ever to be contractually signed to five major Hollywood studios. He wrote music for several films and acted in them as well. In his first major film, <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Come_September_1221.html" title="Come September">Come September</a></i>, a romantic comedy designed to capitalize on his popularity with the teenage and young-adult audience, he met and co-starred with 18-year-old actress <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Dee_28e1.html" title="Sandra Dee">Sandra Dee</a>. They fell in love and were married in 1960. They had one son, Dodd Mitchell Darin, in 1961. They were divorced in 1967.</p>
<p>Asking to be taken seriously, he took on more meaningful movie roles, and in 1962 he won the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_Award_e2c2.html" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for "Most Promising Male Newcomer", for his role in <i>Pressure Point</i>.</p>
<p>In 1963 he was nominated for an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor_ce3c.html" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> for his role as a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">shell-shocked</a> soldier in <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Newman%2C_M.D._7f96.html" title="Captain Newman, M.D.">Captain Newman, M.D.</a></i> At the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes_Film_Festival_715f.html" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, where his recordsâ€”in particular "Beyond the Sea"â€”brought him a wide following, he won the French Film Critics Award for Best Actor.</p>
<p>A major disappointment in his acting career came when he lost the lead role of Tony in <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Side_Story_%28film%29_8f2b.html" title="West Side Story (film)">West Side Story</a></i> to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Beymer_667e.html" title="Richard Beymer">Richard Beymer</a>.

Bobby Darin's late folk/protest period: compilation album, 2004.Produced by Jimmy Scalia</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Darin's musical output became more folky as the 1960s went on and he became more politically aware and active. In 1966 he had another big hit record, but this time it was with folksinger <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Hardin_8644.html" title="Tim Hardin">Tim Hardin</a>'s "<a href="../../../i/f/_/If_I_Were_a_Carpenter_78f0.html" title="If I Were a Carpenter">If I Were a Carpenter</a>" rather than the lighter material he had been recording earlier in the decade. He worked on the 1968 Presidential election campaign of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kennedy_cde1.html" title="Robert Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a> and was profoundly affected by Kennedy's assassination, going into seclusion for a year after that. Coming back, in 1969 he started another record company, Direction Records, putting out folk and protest music. He said of his first Direction album, "The purpose of Direction Records is to seek out statement-makers. The album is solely comprised of compositions designed to reflect my thoughts on the turbulent aspects of modern society." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> He put out several 45s and LPs on Direction. During this time, he was billed under the name "Bob Darin," grew a mustache, and stopped wearing a hairpiece. Within two years, however, all of these changes were dropped.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1970s he continued to act and to record, including several albums with <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown_Records_20d8.html" title="Motown Records">Motown Records</a> and a couple of films. In January 1971, he underwent his first heart surgery in an attempt to correct some of the heart damage he had lived with since childhood.</p>
<p>Bobby married Andrea Yeager in June of 1972. She was not from show business, and Bobby felt that she brought him down to Earth and loved him for who he was, not for his image. In 1972 he starred in his own television variety show, on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Broadcasting_Company_8a11.html" title="National Broadcasting Company">NBC</a>, <i>The Bobby Darin Amusement Company</i>, which ran for two years. He made TV guest appearances and also remained a top draw at Las Vegas, where due to his poor health he was often administered oxygen after his performances.</p>

<p>In 1973, Darin's ill health took a fatal turn when his mechanical heart valve clotted (a known risk of prosthetic heart valves). He had decided to stop taking his anticoagulant drug, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warfarin.html" title="Warfarin">warfarin</a>, that is routinely used to prevent such problems - his heart disease required him to take the drug on a daily basis and to undergo frequent blood tests to determine a satisfactory level of anticoagulation. Unfortunately, Darin reportedly neglected to take antibiotics as a precaution before undergoing dental work; as a result, bacteria seeped into his bloodstream, and further infected his already fragile heart. He died <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, following surgery to repair his heart valve. In accordance with his wishes, his body was donated to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles_9767.html" title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</a> Medical Center for research purposes.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death he divorced his second wife Andrea. Those close to him have said that this was an attempt to distance her from the pain of his death. Even though he did talk to Sandra Dee a short while before his death, the call was mainly to talk to his son Dodd. Contrary to the <i>Beyond the Sea</i> biopic, Sandra was not by his side, nor had she visited him in the final hospital stay, at Bobby's request.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 1990, fellow 1950s rock and roll pioneer, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Anka_ffb4.html" title="Paul Anka">Paul Anka</a>, made the speech for Darin's induction into the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_d7e8.html" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>.

<p>In 2000, actor <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Spacey_d826.html" title="Kevin Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>, a lifelong fan of Darin, acquired the film rights to his story. Spacey directed and produced the film, and played Bobby Darin â€” as well as co-writing the script. The film is named after one of Darin's top hits, <i><a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyond_the_Sea_%28film%29_bc4f.html" title="Beyond the Sea (film)">Beyond The Sea</a></i>. With the consent of the Darin estate, Steve Blauner, and archivist <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Scalia_12f1.html" title="Jimmy Scalia">Jimmy Scalia</a>, the movie was released at the 2004 <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_International_Film_Festival_3c65.html" title="Toronto International Film Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. In spite of its high production values, strong studio promotion, and critical acclaim, box office results were disappointing. However, the movie spurred a renewed interest in Darin which has resulted in the release of "never before heard, or seen" material. His pianist, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Kellaway_2638.html" title="Roger Kellaway">Roger Kellaway</a>, has recorded two albums of Darin's music as well.</p>
