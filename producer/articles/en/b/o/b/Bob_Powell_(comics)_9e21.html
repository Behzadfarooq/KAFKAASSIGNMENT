<p>Powell also did early work for Fox's <i>Wonderworld Comics</i> and <i>Mystery Men Comics</i>; Fiction House's <i>Planet Comics</i>, where his strips included "Gale Allen and the Women's Space Battalion"; <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Comics_cc5c.html" title="Harvey Comics">Harvey</a>'s <i>Speed Comics</i>, for which he wrote and drew the feature "Ted Parrish", (reportedly pencilling at least once under the pseudonym <b>Bob Stanley</b>); <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timely_Comics_1293.html" title="Timely Comics">Timely</a>'s one-shot <i>Tough Kid Squad Comics</i>; <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality_Comics_8dcb.html" title="Quality Comics">Quality</a>'s <i>Crack Comics</i> (where he pencilled as <b>Terence McAully</b>), <i>Hit Comics</i> (as <b>Stanley Charlot</b>), <i>Military Comics</i> (where he signed his pencils for the "Loops and Banks" <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a> strip as <b>Bud Ernest</b>), <i>Smash Comics</i> (as <b>Powell Roberts</b>), and <i>Feature Comics</i>.</p>

<p>As part of the Eisner &amp; Iger studio, Powell drew many of the earliest adventures of the jungle-queen Sheena in <i>Jumbo Comics</i>, though Robert Webb would soon become the longest-running Sheena artist. Later, after <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Eisner_082e.html" title="Will Eisner">Will Eisner</a> split off to form his own studio in an arrangement with Quality publisher <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everett_M.__Busy__Arnold_e977.html" title="Everett M. &quot;Busy&quot; Arnold">Everett M.

Powell remained uncredited until Eisner and Cuidera, in a 1999 panel, discussed his contribution.<sup id="_ref-pov_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pov" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Powell became particularly known for his "<a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_girl_art.html" title="Good girl art">good girl art</a>" in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine_Enterprises_a934.html" title="Magazine Enterprises">Magazine Enterprises</a>' <i>Cave Girl</i>, and in Fiction House's <i>Jungle Comics</i>, where he worked on early Sheena stories and later on the <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebra.html" title="Zebra">zebra</a>-<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">bikini'd</a> <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle.html" title="Jungle">jungle</a> adventuress Camilla.</p>
<p>In the realm of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> comics, Powell co-created the patriotic character personifying the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_of_%2776_%28comics%29.html" title="Spirit of '76 (comics)">Spirit of '76</a>, in Harvey's <i>Pocket Comics</i> #1 (Aug. 1941). It would become a long-running feature in Harvey's <i>Green Hornet Comics</i>. Powell also penciled a Golden Age <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a> story, "The Sorcerer's Sinister Secret", in Timely's <i>All Winners Comics</i> #4 (Spring 1942), and pencilled a chapter of the historic <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Winners_Squad_9be7.html" title="All-Winners Squad">All Winners Comics</a></i> #19 (Fall 1946). He notably drew the backup feature "Mr. Mystic" in Eisner's "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spirit_d3be.html" title="The Spirit">The Spirit Section</a>", a 16-page comic-book insert for Sunday newspapers, from the feature's inception in 1940 until Powell entered the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_e341.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> for his <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">military service</a> in 1943.</p>

<p>Following his discharge, Powell formed his own studio and drew for numerous comic-book publishers. Among his notable works through the 1950s and early 1960s were features and covers for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_and_Smith_5fc4.html" title="Street and Smith">Street and Smith</a>'s <i>Shadow Comics</i>; Magazine Enterprises' <i>Bobby Benson's B-Bar-B Riders</i>, and all four issues of <i>Strong Man</i>; Harvey Comics' <i>Man in Black</i>, <i>Adventures in 3-D</i> and <i>True 3-D</i>; and a handful of early <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books_7e75.html" title="Silver Age of Comic Books">Silver Age</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29_111b.html" title="Daredevil (Marvel Comics)">Daredevil</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Pym_4cd4.html" title="Henry Pym">Giant-Man</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulk_%28comics%29.html" title="Hulk (comics)">Hulk</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Storm_fb44.html" title="Johnny Storm">Human Torch</a> stories for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a>.

<p><b>Tom Heintjes</b>: "After <i>The Spirit</i>, perhaps the best drawn feature in the section was Powell's 'Mr. Mystic'. Eisner created Mr. Mystic by retooling his Yarko the Great, which had been syndicated overseas. After running through Eisner's scripts, Powell wrote and drew the feature until he was drafted a couple of years later. (A very good artist, Powell was a journeyman writer who tried but never managed to sell Eisner on some <i>Spirit</i> scripts, a situation that rankled Powell for some time.) 'Mr. Mystic' was cut from the Sunday section's lineup in 1944, by which time <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Guardineer_c3a3.html" title="Fred Guardineer">Fred Guardineer</a> was handling its production".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

"Busy" Arnold</a> creating tensions with Powell: "There were problems between partners, because Arnold had his own line of books, and we were sometimes competitors. He offered Bob Powell an increase on what I was paying him for working on 'The Spirit Section', and Bob came to me and said, 'I can make more with your partners.' I called up Arnold and said, 'You want a lawsuit?' Arnold apologized but Powell got very angry, and he said, 'You ruined my career! You cut me off.' I said, 'Well, you want to quit me, and go down the street and work for someone else...well, all right. But you're not going to work for my partner while I'm around'. Anyway, we settled it. When I went into the service ... I got a letter from Bob Powell that said, 'Well, now that you're in the Army, you might get killed. I want to tell you that I forgive you' (laughter)".<sup id="_ref-pov_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pov" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
