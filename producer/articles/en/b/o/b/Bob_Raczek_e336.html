<p>Robert Raczek was born and raised in the little farming community of Knowlton, Wisconsin. Raczek grew up surrounded by labor and hard work, which would then dissolve from hard farm work, into hard football practices. Raczek loved football, and he played high school football at <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosinee.html" title="Mosinee">Mosinee</a>, where he also excelled in other sports such as <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track.html" title="Track">track</a>, and <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>. Raczek would then go onto the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Stout_b34e.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Stout">University of Wisconsin-Stout</a>, where he played football, and was also an assistant coach for a while. He graduated from UW-Stout in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, and went on to pursue a teaching career. However, football was not far behind. Razek would soon marry, and is still currently married to his wife, Pat. Together, they had three boys and a daughter (Mary Ellen, Mark, Steve, and Matt) Both Mark and Steve Raczek played under their father at Pacelli, and both were recognized in the conference and the state as great football players and wrestlers.</p>
<p>Raczek found a job at Tri County-Plainfield high school, where he was teaching technical education, physical eduaction, and was head of the maintenance department. Raczek first took up the head coaching spot for Tri-County in 1962, where he finished with a miserable 0-7 record. He coached for three more years, when he was offered a job at Stevens Point <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacelli_High_School_%28Wisconsin%29_adb8.html" title="Pacelli High School (Wisconsin)">Pacelli High School (Wisconsin)</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevens_Point_ed75.html" title="Stevens Point">Stevens Point</a>. Raczek accepted, and so his legacy began.</p>

<p>Raczek had attended the Mosinee high school, where there he played football and other sports. Raczek loved the game, and grew to understand what makes football so great. Raczek currently lives around Mosinee, so he is still in touch with his roots. Raczek recalled, "I made lifelong friendships from coaching this great game of football and to have worked with so many great coaches and players." Raczek then moved onto the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_Stout_a6e9.html" title="University of Wisconsin Stout">University of Wisconsin Stout</a>, were he learned about different sciences, and football. <a href="http://www.wifca.org/halloffame/2000/2000raczekbob.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wifca.org/halloffame/2000/2000raczekbob.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Raczek left Mosinee High School, and headed for northern Wisconsin to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_Stout_a6e9.html" title="University of Wisconsin Stout">University of Wisconsin Stout</a>. There, Raczek pursued a Bachelors of Science degree, and wanted to teach.</p>
<p>As a student of UW-Stout, Raczek participated in numerous sports, such as <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track.html" title="Track">track</a>, and of course <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>. He learned what the college life of football was really about, and how much more different it is from the high school level. As a student, Raczek received an assistant coaching job for the football team. So, in the 1961-62 football season, Raczek assistant coached the UW-Stout football team. He learned certain terminology and plays that would later transform into the current plays he has for the Pacelli Cardinals.</p>
<p>Raczek graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, then later he was offered a job to teach and coach at the Tri County-Plainfield high school.

<p>Fall is a time for football, and Raczek knew it. He had played football and helped coached since his early days as a child, and not he had the chance to be the head coach of a real football team. In the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, Raczek came to Tri County-Plainfield as the head football coach, and the tech-ed teacher. He taught in both football, and tech-ed for four years at the high school before persuing new locations to teach and coach.</p>
<p>Racek had started his coaching career with <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_Stout_a6e9.html" title="University of Wisconsin Stout">University of Wisconsin Stout</a> as an assistant coach in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. He had played for them as well, and attended the school, so he knew the system. Raczek was a huge fan of the running game, and would later pass that onto his players in the high school level. Raczek coached for UW-Stout for only one year, leaving to go to Plainfield.</p>
<p>As the head football coach for Tri County-Plainfield, his records did not live up to what he is known for today. In the four years that he coached for them, he had two winning season, just bairly being called winning. His first two seasons were not so hot. His first finished a record of 0-7. His second season finished 3-4. In two years, Raczek was 3-11. He did not give up though, and neither did the school. His third season he finished a good 6-2. His fourth and final season with Tri County-Plainfield he finished 5-3. Raczek understood the high school level of football, and then went onto <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacelli_High_School_%28Wisconsin%29_adb8.html" title="Pacelli High School (Wisconsin)">Pacelli High School (Wisconsin)</a> to teach his new ideas, that would lead him to three state titles and 310 career wins.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Raczek_e336.html" title="Edit section: Pacelli Cardinals (Football)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pacelli Cardinals (Football)</span></h3>
<p>Bob Raczek assumed head coaching for the football team of Pacelli high school in 1967, where his hard work attitude would shape the school into a very notable high school. Pacelli high school is a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_school.html" title="Private school">private school</a>, with not a lot of funding into the athletic department, so Raczek made do with what he had at the time. The Cardinals finished the 1967 season with a record of 4-5, finishing sixth place in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference.html" title="Conference">conference</a>. Bob raczek knew that if he wanted success with this team, he would have to put a lot of time and effort into the school's athletics. Not only was Raczek the head football coach, he later assumed the coaching spots for wrestling, track, and hockey, as well as teach technical eduaction and physical education. The next year, the Cardinals finished the same as the previous, a 4-5 record placing sixth in the conference. Things looked bad from there.</p>
<p>For the next two years, the team suffered terrible loosing records, 1-7-1 <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and 2-7 <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. But in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> the Cardinals football team had a winning record for the first time since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. They finished the season with an excellent 9-1 records, placing first in the conference. The following season would be Pacelli's bets season in their history of having a football team. The team reached the state championship apart of WISAA, entering the title apart of division 3. The championship game ended with the Cardinals losing to Milwaukee Pius XI, with the final score of 10-0. In deed it was a heart breaker, but Raczek would not let that interfere with his future success. He would once again see the championship field.</p>

<p>Raczek gave the Cardinals winning records for the next 13 seasons, {all but 1 were winning). In 1986, the Cardinals made it back to the WISAA Division 3 state championship, this time they would face off against <a href="../../../w/a/u/Waukesha_Catholic_Memorial_3963.html" title="Waukesha Catholic Memorial">Waukesha Catholic Memorial</a>. It has been said that the Waukesha was so proud of themselves, they allowed the championship game to be played at Pacelli's homefield, played at Goerke Field (the same location where the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Stevens Point football team plays). So, the game was played in Stevens Point, and to a lot of people's surprise, Pacelli defeated Waukesha Memorial with a final score of 13-3, capping a perfect season of 13-0. The Cardinals would again see the championship lights in 1989, but would fall short of their glory losing to Watertown Northwestern Prep, 44-20.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Pacelli football team was ready for action, and at the start of the season, they would not let anyone get in their way. The Cardinals set numerous school records that year in rushing, sacks, and tackles. The 95 Cardinals made it to the state championship, and destroyed Manitowac Lutheran, 28-0. The season ended with a perfect 12-0 record, (the last Pacelli football team to go undefeated) and only allowed 77 points all season (the 1986 Cardinals beat them by allowing only 55 points). The 1995 Cardinals also scored an amazing 458 points. The following year, the Cardinals made it back to the championship, with senior Mike Elsenrath leading the way. The Cardinals lost the game to conference rival Marshfield Columbus, 42-6.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Cardinals moved into the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WIAA_beb0.html" title="WIAA">WIAA</a>, and things got a little harder for the team. Winning only one conference title from 2000-2005. However, the 2005 Cardinals managed to find a way into the state championship, being apart of Division 7. Going into the playoffs, the Cardinals were not a top seed, but crushed all of their opponents leading to the title game (except Hilbert, who loss by only a score of 7-0). The Cardinals played the Gilman Pirtates, and it would be Bob Raczek's 300th career win. The Cardinals smashed Gilman, ending the game with a score of 44-20. Bob Raczek now had 300 wins, and was put in the 300 club along with other legendary Wisconsin football coaches like Bob Hyland and Dick Basham.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Cardinals went 9-0, into the playoff with a number 1 seed, and one their first round. They lost in the second round to conference foe Shiocton Chiefs, who Pacelli had beaten earlier that season. Bob Razcek now stands with a record of 310-147-2.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Raczek_e336.html" title="Edit section: Cancer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cancer</span></h2>
<p>The shocking news came to the Raczek family in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> that Bob Raczek has been diagnosed with cancer. Doctors did not know whether it would be life threatening, and offered Raczek <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotherapy.html" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. Raczek had a hard time telling his players during a practice that season, and the players did not take it too well. Many people of the school and community feared that 2004 would be Raczek's last season coaching football. The legendary coach had imprinted his image in the hearts of thousands of people throughout Wisconsin, and it would be painful to see a great coach of that magnitude to retire under those circumstances, as did the great <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Lombardi_4a75.html" title="Vince Lombardi">Vince Lombardi</a>.</p>
<p>Raczek however overcame the pains, and still managed to coach the following season. Raczek was well known for his strong, hard core attitude and his desire to win and train hard, and he would yell at his players and carry them on a leesh like a dog, and he trained his philosophies to his assistant coaches. In his later days, that attitude declined, due to his condition. Raczek still managed however to yell at the players and continue to teach them the sport of football. Racek is currently alive and well, still with cancer, but also still coaching. His most recent season went as great 10-1 in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> before ending on a hard note.</p>

<p>Bob Raczek is virtually synonymous with Pacelli football, and the high school at that matter. Over the past forty years, there have been some really close games that have excited the fans, and even the media. Pacelli high school football has had it's clash of rivalries, compared to the great <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>-<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_09a2.html" title="Ohio State Buckeyes">Ohio State Buckeyes</a>-<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Wolverines_bcf5.html" title="Michigan Wolverines">Michigan Wolverines</a> rivalries. Maybe the games are not at the same magnitude as those bigger rivalries are, but they are legendary no doubt.</p>
<p><b>Marshfield Columbus</b></p>
<p>The classic rivalry in Pacelli football history has always been against Marshfield Columbus in the old catholic conference of the CWCC. The game always seemed like it was down to the win, in determining the champion of the conference. However, Marshfield Columbus always proved dominate over Pacelli, with an overall record of 29-17-1, ranging from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Pacelli has always struggled against Marshfield Columbus (even in Pacelli's dominant 1986 season, Pacelli only won with a score of 3-0 over Marshfield Columbus).</p>
<p><b>Eau Claire Regis</b></p>
<p>Like the classic rivalry between Marshfield Columbus, Eau Claire Regis has had it's great games against Pacelli. The rivalry was a good, ranging from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. In those years, Pacelli has had the upperhand, with a record of 25-18. However, in recent years the rivalry has changed, seeing Regis defeat Pacelli in some critical games. Although the two teams are no longer in the same conference, they met in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, both games being in the playoffs. In 2002, the Cardinals went 8-1 in the regular season, and had greatness in the playoffs. Then, in the semi-finals, Pacelli played Regis, and in a close game, Regis edged Pacelli 21-14, ending a great season for the Cardinals. The following year the two teams met again, this time it was all Regis, closing the lid on the Cardinals 24-0. The hatred between the two school had died down for a little bit, but after 2003, it has been lighted once again.</p>
<p><b>La Crosse Aquinas</b></p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous rivalry in Wisconsin catholic football history, that being Pacelli vs. Aquinas. Both teams have had it's glory days, especially Aquinas. Pacelli has played Aquinas 45 times, starting in 1961, where in their first meeting Aquinas dominated the game winning 39-6. Aquinas has edged Pacelli always, with an overall record of 25-20 against Pacelli. Bob Raczek always seems to select Aquinas as the season opener, to get a feeling of pride and confidence in not only beating, but playing Aquinas. The rivalry died down a little in the early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000%27s.html" title="2000's">2000's</a>, once Pacelli and Aquinas separated from the CWCC conference. Lately, Raczek has scheduled Aquinas in as the season opener for the past three seasons now, Pacelli winning all three of them. For the start of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> regular season, Pacelli will play against Aquinas in Stevens Point.</p>
