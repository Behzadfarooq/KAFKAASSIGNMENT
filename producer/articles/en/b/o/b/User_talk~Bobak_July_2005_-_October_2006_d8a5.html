<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Gulval disaster zone</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I've fixed up the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulval.html" title="Gulval">Gulval</a> page that you tagged, it looks much cleaner now and I've added a bit more info, though I'm not really sure how to deal with the stupid picture link that was left in the middle of the page - can you help me out? I will probably pop by later and try fleshing out the rest of the article as it is a bit barren. - R 11-Apr-06</p>
<p>Something regarding my Photos? You're welcome to look/comment at my <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_Gallery_86d2.html" title="User:Bobak/Gallery">Photo Gallery</a></b> page.</p>
<p>No sorry, you misunderstand me - I have tidied up the page, but as I have only recently started contributing I don't really know how to deal with pictures. The page you tagged has a picture link embedded in it, which when clicked goes to some Wikipedia copyright page. I don't know whether this means that the picture doesn't exist, whether it has been removed for copyright reasons, or whether the original author didn't know what they were doing with the link. You seem to have some skills in this area, and I wondered whether, seeing as you flagged the page, if you would mind having a quick look at the link and tell me what its all about - many thanks - R</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immurement</span></h2>
<p>A search shows that this means merely "imprisonment" which is not a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> of itself. Why is it a death penalty? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 19:29, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, thanks for the question: Often, particularly in ancient/medieval times, the person immured was not intended to be punished by imprisonment, rather killed. This is similar to burning or being buried alive in that it <i>may</i> be intended to kill the person (or not). When I've heard it used as a term to describe a way of dispatching people it's been used as "sealed in a wall" or "walling" (heck, the idea of walling someone was even used in The Simpsons (the episode was "Last Exit to Springfield"), but when the random idea came up to look it up here I wasn't able to find it anywhere. So I looked around the regular web and found the term immure/immurement is the proper word for the process. Thus, I added the term to the forms of execution, alas I didn't have the time to do a proper article for the link. For those brief reasons I think the addition was fair and justifiable. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The propblem is that the definition appears to be imprisonment, not execution. The online definitions I checked made no mention that it was anything other than a synonym for imprisonment. The list on the article already mentions starvation I believe. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 15:25, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hello again. I noticed you editted out immurement without any further discussion. Well, please let me convince you otherwise:
<ul>
<li>"The problem is that the definition appears to be imprisonment, not execution". This reasoning is flawed: If you want to emphasize on the specific <i>cause</i> of death as when speaking about immurement, then you could easily eliminate "burning" by saying it simply causes massive organ failure and/or asphyxiation, "Crucifixion" is eliminated because death is caused by asphyxiation and/or loss of blood; "Snake Pit" is poisen (I hope!), and the list goes on... Immurment is the proper definition of "walling" someone. If you wall someone the intention is to kill as much as the others. The fact that death results of starvation is <i>secondary</i> to the <i>primary</i> form of intended execution, which is immurment. After all, as a lawyer, I can assure you that the prosecution of a criminal is the <i>intent</i> (how did they mean to kill someone, mitigated by how awful a way they chose to dispatch the victim), certainly not how the person eventually succumbed.</li>
<li>"The online definitions I checked made no mention that it was anything other than a synonym for imprisonment." To base the entire use of a word on a mere online definition misses the greater understanding of word. Just compare any online dictionary definition to an encyclopedia definition to see how the mere definition of a word can miss entire uses and practical understandings of said word. Please allow me to refer you to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merriam-Webster_4fd8.html" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a>'s definition of <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=immurement" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=immurement" rel="nofollow">immurement</a>; please may close attention to definition (2), which states "to build into a wall; <i>especially</i>: to entomb in a wall" (emphasis in original). Now, the term "entomb" does not say, alive or dead when placed inside, but the implication is very clear. After all the mere definition of the word <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/burning" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/burning" rel="nofollow">burning</a> does not imply capital punishment any more than immurement, but both can be used with that clear implication.</li>
<li>The use of "walling" (which is even more vague a definition than "immurement") is well documented in history and popular culture. For a quick historical example, please refer to the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../a/k/a/Akaba.html" title="Akaba">Akaba</a>. It was used to dispatch a prisoner is the <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_%28TV_series%29_f2b2.html" title="Oz (TV series)">Oz (TV series)</a>(episode 40), where a character's enemies seal him up in a thick concrete wall (death was clearly the intent).</li>
<li>The actual use of this for of execution is very old and fell out of favor (likely because the only people who could afford to execute someone in this way were emperors, kings and warlord; and it was probably expensive to build walls that would accomodate the victims). The only reason it was resurrected for a show like "Oz" is that the show took particular glee in dispatching characters in increasingly brutal (and in this case, primitive and shocking) ways.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>For the above reasons and more, I am re-adding immurement. I am more than happy to go with a different word, if someone can find one that is better defined. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 16:24, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[With respect, I have moved a copy of this discussion to the discussion page for <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> (it's #39) since it would probably benefit from more input and feedback. I feel odd discussing this here. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 16:34, 16 January 2006 (UTC)]</p>

You shouldn't upload images with such names, because they're hard to track and we can't really know what is it about without actually looking at it.

<dd>Not only the name is a bit unfortunate, <i>Photo taken by Bobak Ha'Eri. December 2005. Please observe license and properly cite in use outside Wikipedia.</i> is not really a great summary.

<dd>I was not questioning your competence at all, how would I without knowing you are an attorney&#160;:-). But allow me to ask what are the legal reasons for putting the statement about the license (which is essentially contained in the license text in the first place) in the summary section (which is supposed to tell the reader about the image contents) instead of the license section? --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschwen_069f.html" title="User:Dschwen">Dschwen</a> 17:30, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm joking a bit, but my point (in that it wasn't made directly) was, lawyers are more careful than most, and since there's no word limit I might as well clarify the license since (frankly) the CC licenses are not very well known and read confusingly to just about anyone outside law. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 18:01, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi there, thanks! I'm not a photo expert, but I use a pretty basic Sony Cybershot set to low light exposure --the trick is to place it somewhere very stable (a tripod would be preferable, but I don't have one and have to set it on objects with the timer set). For more details on each photo, I believe you can click on the image link and, at the bottom of the Wikipedia generated image:[photo] page there should be the details of what settings were used. If you want a short cut to the photos I've done, check my user <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_Gallery_86d2.html" title="User:Bobak/Gallery">gallery</a>..... <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 17:18, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a gamer and as I noted in my nomination, I had a pleasant time looking at some old games from my Commodore 64 days but that didn't dissuade me from considering the web site non-notable.

<dd>I am seeking consensus by nominating this article for afd and let the masses decide. I never said it wasn't a good site, I suggested that it wasn't notable for a wikipedia article. Articles should be well written for all; this article is really a bit of an advertisement for the web site, which makes avid gamers happy, but is not encyclopedic. If it comes back as a section in an article on the history of games, that would be a very worthwhile addition to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 02:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is an Iranian other than a nationality? I am Persian, the <i>ethnicity</i>. My family's been Persian for generations, and I have never set foot in the country called Iran. Like many Persians in the West, I don't consider myself Iranian. "Iranian" is just a place to be a citizen, like the US and Canada. The historical development of Azeris is no different than Palestinians or Kurds. They were historically weaker (politically) and were thus put under the spheres of much stronger countries, Russia/USSR and Persia/Iran. If anything, they're more Turkic than Aryan. That's my position and it will not sway. -- <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 16:16, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bobak, sorry for you being dragged into this. I’m having a bitter argument with some of our colleagues from Iran, who claim that Azeris are ethnic Iranians, while Azeris as Turkic-speakers are one of Turkic peoples. It’s not just me opposing their view, but also a number of third party editors, who are completely impartial in this issue. The dispute goes on for quite a long time at the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> page. There’s nothing wrong with people having disagreement about certain things, as long as the discussion is conducted in a civilized manner. But this guy employs very provocative methods of making his point, such as adding controversial userboxes to our project page, or Iranian stub templates to Azerbaijan related pages, which resulted in some of Azeri editors taking similar actions with regard to some Iranian pages. This should stop, and probably will because of interference of admins. This anon has already been blocked, fifth time already. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 17:01, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not totally true and you are being dishonest user:Grandmaster. You go as far trying to disassociate Azari music form Iranian music. You made a sentence arguing it was based on a specific article that once authenticated turned out to be saying the oppoiste as you. You have delelted other users expressions and user boxs calling it illegal and vandalism. How can that be? Your arguements grow weaker. I provided genetic evidence, scientific evidence proving that Azeris are only Turcophones or Turkic speakers who are a mixture of Armenians and an Iranic strain. In fact it is your arguemnts on the ground of genetics that are overdue now and need solid citations. You have asked other editors to verify their statemtns but yet you do not do so the same. This is hypocracy. ALso trying to through me out of the Azeri Project page becuase I do not agree with you and one other user. Trying to demonize me and other editors. Even trying to force us to accpet the minority perspective and spelling for <b>Azarbaijan.</b> This is not right and you are making false statments about me. In the past you have deleted others contributions and arguments about the Azari people on the talk page and you continue to do so with me. The people of Latin America are not considered SPainish or Portuges due to their language by anthropologists, they only speak that language. If language was an indicator of race or ethnicity then most Africa would considered European, either Anglo-Saxon or other European groups. Sorry to get you involved user, but user:Grandmaster is gaming the system. He addititonally does not tell you how he gets me blocked strategically by ganging up against me with one other editor.

<p>Thank you, it was my pleasure to help out. From your street description, I was able to find the appropriate area by scrolling the map, but I couldn't figure out how to get Google to tell me what coordinates I was actually looking at, so I found it by trial and error, which was a bit of a pain. There must be a better way to use these mapping systems - I'll have to try to read up on how to use them to go from a map to a set of coordinates. The other thing I would like to find is the appropriate <a href="../../../u/s/g/USGS_c331.html" title="USGS">USGS</a> quad map of the area.

<p>Hi, Bobak. If you look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.195.112.193_be64.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.195.112.193">Special:Contributions/71.195.112.193</a>, you'll see the time of his/her last vandalism or last edit. We never block IPs hours after they stop vandalizing, because if the IP is a dynamic one, or if it's a shared one (perhaps from a public library) the person affected by the block may not be the person who carried out the vandalism. When admins go through the IPs or usernames that have been reported, they remove each one with an edit summary saying something like, "blocked", "already blocked", "seems to have stopped", "doesn't seem to be vandalism" etc., and end the edit summary with "List not empty" while there are still some cases that haven't been dealt with, or "List empty" if they've just removed the last username. That means that other admins who have <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> on their watchlists will know if they're needed to deal with the backlog, or if it has all been taken care of.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">College Football use of images</span></h2>
<p>Bobak, since you helped the project before regarding media guide images and fair use, I was hoping you could help again. Recently, another user has removed images of school logos and an image of the cover of a media guide and an image about a player from an article (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Colorado_Buffaloes_football_team_f7b1.html" title="2006 Colorado Buffaloes football team">2006 Colorado Buffaloes football team</a>). They were all tagged fair use, with the last two specifically tagged {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromotional_2e75.html" title="Template:Promotional">Promotional</a>}}. I believe that since the images (not the logos) were illustrating the item being talked about (the player is a pre-season award nominee, and the media guide cover says 2006 Colorado football, that's what this article is about!). Shouldn't promotional images supplied by the media guide/university (the player image was sent by e-mail to subscribers of a list, "pushlished" by the university then, so clearly the Promotional tag fits) be allowed to be used more than other images (such as school logos which I was argue in a second) since the university is pushlishing them for media use? From <a href="../../../f/u/p/WP%7EFUP_daa7.html" title="WP:FUP">WP:FUP</a> <b>specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text</b> and from the Promotional tag: <b>to illustrate the work or product in question;</b>. I believe this was being accomplished. For the logos, they are also meeting all this, except they aren't promotional, so I could see reserving the use of their images for limited cases, although using their image on a page of these sorts would help clarify exactally what the article is refering to. Please see the discussion and help there at: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_College_football_Yearly_team_pages_format_9935.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football/Yearly team pages format">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football/Yearly team pages format</a>.

<p>Hey. Are you saying that (in the talk page on the Colbert Report article) that we <i>should</i> have an article on Brian Peppers?</p>

<p>It's not that (feeling sorry for his disability) gets in the way of (deciding notability). It's that, well, what the hell else is there about him?</p>
<p>"Brian Peppers is clinically ugly. He lives in a nursing home in Ohio, and got arrested for sexual misconduct with a staff member there. His police picture looks so ugly that many people online didn't believe it was real, but it is." We had so many utterly garbage versions of that article, over and over again. Stretching out the tiny little bits of data. He may be in the public sphere by dint of having committed an offense for which he was arrested (was he convicted? Did he go to trial? Did he plead guilty? Do we know?), but so are hundreds of thousands of other people who've done much the same thing - and <i>they</i> aren't notable.</p>
<p>Internet memes are damn easy to create, so we have to have particularly strict standards for inclusion. The reason the talk page was blanked as well was that people kept shoving the content of the deleted page <i>into the talk page</i>. Over and over and over again. The same people. People who didn't participate in Wikipedia in any way except to say "HEY THERE SHOULD BE AN ARTICLE ON THIS PEPPERS GUY HE LOOKS FREAKY!"</p>
<p>And if we let people paste the content of deleted articles into talk pages, then what's the point of deleting them in the first place?</p>
<p>It's not that we were personally offended by the Peppers article. It's that we were annoyed by the page being legitimately deleted, and then re-created. And deleted. And re-created. And re-created. And re-created. By people who had no interest in the project outside of that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">USC Tournament Wins</span></h2>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that Wikipedia articles are supposed to provide the reader information that they might be curious about. I was reading the USC article and it said that only one university had more wins than it did. Being that I am in Jordan and considering going to school in the United States, I wanted to know which school had a better athletic record than USC. I did some research and discovered that UCLA did. I know that there are probably other people who have read the USC article and have wondered the same thing. Therefore, since wikipedia is meant to provide people with information I do not see why this piece of factual information was removed from the article. We are trying to create an unbiased presentation of the information. the USC article correctly identifies that it has won things against UCLA at certain times, why can it not provide information that UCLA has done better than it at certain times? I hope that this action is not a reflection on USC since I was considering attending this school next year.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In case you don't see my answer on the IP's talk page, here's what I wrote: The information of who specifically has the better record (which is relative, USC has fewer teams competing that UCLA, thus there's an inherent flaw in the system) should be for an article about which collegiate teams have the most championships. Please compare this to the same reason, in the article about Jordan, a person may include where Jordan's GNP is ranked but not who's above and below since that would be extraneous and can be left for an article outlining that list. --Bobak 14:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Persian people is not that great either. The Persian people article relates not just to the people of Iran, but Tajikistan, and other countries outside Iran. More often than not, the Persian people link is used to represent the historical spread of the people in that region. Disambiguating to Iran, however, makes it clear that the person has an Iranian heritage. In the same way, a person who is born in Iran of American parents, would have a link to the United States. That's how most links to countries deal with it. The difference is that Iranian history is much longer, and more complicated. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 21:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You can be insulted if you want, but you should read both the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a>, and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a>, and all the talk pages. I wasn't born in Iran, but I consider myself Persian, and I still believe the best link is to Iran. Regardless it's not a big deal to me, and you can think things are brash, or insulting however you wish. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 23:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am still waiting for someone not to dismiss me but to address my copyright analysis. I do this in the course of my job and it is irritating to be just told I'm wrong and to shut up without addressing my basic points.</p>
<p>Does the LCMS, as copyright holder not have exclusive rights to copy and to display its images?</p>
<p>If so, how does Wikipedia's use qualify under the first factor, since it is not an accredited academic institution?</p>
<p>Isn't the image a work of art, the second factor tending to weigh against fair use?</p>
<p>Isn't the who image being used?</p>
<p>The fourth factor likely finds in favor of fair use, however the first three do not do so.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't I conclude that the fair use case fails or is uncertain?</p>
<p>Also, since wikipedia policy is to remove the logo if the copyright holder protests (<a href="../../../l/o/g/WP%7ELOGOS_bfc2.html" title="WP:LOGOS">WP:LOGOS</a>) why should we not remove it when it is clear that they disapprove?
