<p>Saw your provision of citations for the Panama-Vancouver relationship, but I don't have JSTOR so can't ref them at all to see what they say. Did see your inline comment though and quite frankly it doesn't make much sense to me - why would Canadian grain have to go through Vancouver to get to Europe? Maybe freezing in the St. Lawrence I guess, but that's <i>after</i> harvest season. Why would grain/shipping prices to Europe via Vancouver-Panama be more economical than via Montreal? The <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crow_Rate_cf2c.html" title="Crow Rate">Crow Rate</a> also made it more costly, I think, to ship agricultural produce west, just as it did with manufactured goods. I'll quote here from a note I left Ds13 late last night, just before bed:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It was the opening of the CPR (the first British-controlled transcontinental railway, since the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific and I think at least one other transcontinental railway had already been finished in 1886) that placed Vancouver in a key point in international trade, as the shipping time from Hong Kong to London via San Francisco-New York was 45 days, via Vancouver-Montreal it was 27 days (I think this cite Morley's Milltown to Metropolis book somewhere, also in Maj. Matthews' Early Vancouver in a passing reference somewhere; but I read</i> a lot <i>of stuff when I was a heritage researcher for the Gastown BIA in '89 and can't recall exactly where I read it). The Panama railroad was a bit of competition, but still a bit slower and also not under British control, which was the point of Vancouver, which was one of the lynchpins in the "All Red Route" (note the redlink, as that should have an article), which went around the globe entirely via British ports and soil (e.g. Bombay-Singapore-Hong Kong-Vancouver), I guess via the Cape of Good Hope earlier on before the British took over Palestine, Jordan and Iraq after the collapse of the Ottomans. Anyway, when the Panama Canal opened int'l shipping was largely diverted from Vancouver via the newer, shorter route, which also didn't have to contend with the icefloes of the St. Lawrence and its Gulf (even though it wasn't "All Red", i.e. not British).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>One item to add - 1914 brought Vancouver's economy to a screeching halt; I don't know about the port and I doubt that its importance as the shortest conduit between the Auld Sod and the British Orient and India was likely even more important - including for the shipment of troops to the fronts from India, as well as the hundred-odd thousand (or few hundred thousand??) Chinese coolies who were engaged by the government of France during that war (mentioned in Morley I think, and also here in Wiki on the relevant Paris section of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinatown.html" title="Chinatown">Chinatown</a> or on a Chinatown (France) page maybe); they were kept in quarantine in the port of Vancouver somewhere, then also at Petawawa (I think) before being shipped across the Atlantic. They weren't shipped via Panama, suggesting military/political reasons they weren't sent that way; but I can't see what it was that would be being shipped out of Vancouver that was more economical to ship via Panama than via the CPR; the "tea and silk trains" ran from the day the railhead opened and kept up that pace until after the end of the Empire; US railways couldn't compete for various reasons. I know, I know, find a cite.....you might also pls have a look at my comments about the lead paragraphs to the article which I left on <a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDs13_1d29.html" title="User talk:Ds13">Ds13</a>'s page after the Panama comments. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 01:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Further comment: as you can see by recent edits I've been trying to get the chronology straight in the history section; but I just got in from a film set after being up since 4:15 this morning so am gonna wiki-out as it's hard to get the textual/chronological fluidity running right; the danger in this section is that it becomes too long, and given my prolix style I probably should be over on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Vancouver_6293.html" title="History of Vancouver">History of Vancouver</a> page first, trying to get the missing-era outlines done, rather than trying to untangle the current pastiche on this page. I better sign off and lie down for a while before I zombie myself in front of the computer for the rest of the evening (btw the film was <i>Battle in Seattle</i> and looks to be "politically authentic"; sometime this coming week they're bringing up 1000 volunteer extras from Seattle to restage the whole shebang!)</p>

<p>From my understanding and what I had been told, the original people's list had been a list of articles created or articles contributed to by our WikiProject Members. While the original list may have 'booted' its articles off its list, I feel it would be a good idea to keep track of all our articles for many reasons. The first is that I would like to see many articles associated with our project to eventually become featured status, not just <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. We won't be able to accomplish or keep that goal in mind if we remove all traces of our 'good articles'. Another good point is that It's handy to have a directory of Vancouver related articles for either research, interest, and scope. Not to mention everyone including our members will get to see all the work we do. The assessment team in our WikiProject are very backlogged. Reviewing an article is hard work and very time consuming. Also, our contributors are not relying on those rating systems nor the colaboration of the month in focusing their efforts. Quickly dividing those articles into three lists of quality allow for fast management of the lists as well as users to quickly see which articles are in dire need based upon category: people, arts and culture, etc. etc. Thanks for all your work by the way, I'm happy to see how far <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> has come. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 06:37, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got some help from a comp-sci friend of mine from UBC. He helped me do some of the tricky parts, but I had to do the rest first (like the rafters -- he helped with the seats). He used a program, but it's in the beta phase and he's not willing to release it though, so I can't help you there. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#948663">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1">?!</font></a> 08:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, I withdrew the nomination for Showcase pic. It's got way too many deficits to even have a chance of being voted in.

<dd>Well, and also the fact that GM Place is so huge (so a panorama is needed for a good pic showing everything) and that people were moving around, so blurriness in the final stitching was somewhat impossible to avoid. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#948663">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1">?!</font></a> 18:38, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am relatively new to Wikipedia editing, and I wanted to say that I enjoyed our discussion on King, Granatstein and the Japanese internment; it was interesting and worthwhile. Most importantly it showed that intelligent discussion is possible on the internet. As for Granatstein and history, I agree with you (if I'm paraphrasing correctly) that we as Canadians do not need to minimize the mistakes we have made in order appreciate our success. Once again, thank you. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoomot_025d.html" title="User:Moomot">Moomot</a> 01:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I enjoyed that exchange as well. A major benefit I look to get out of Wikipedia is for my own learning, including sharpening what I think I already know.

<p>Hi; you're the only other editor who commented on using the French version as "alternate name" in the box on the BC page; as alternate name I'd say it should be "Dogwood Province" or at best "Pacific Province", but this being English-language Wikipedia (and <i>not</i> a bilingual/bitextual Canadian version) I can't see any reason to include the French, and a lot of reasons not to; likewise in the first line of the article. The absurdity of it is heightened when you consider that we're expected to use accents in Montreal and Quebec now (which I don't) while CanFrench steadfastly refuses to even pronounce Vancover correctly (while snitting at us if we don't pronounce it in English as it is in French...); and while <i>la fleuve Columbia</i> is "Columbia River" in French, they're insistent that the area named for the Columbia is <i>colombie</i> (which no, historically, it wasn't). Rehashing old ground here, but wary of starting an edit war by replacing colombie-brittannique with an actual alternate English name ("God's Country", "Dogwood Province", "Pacific Province", "Bennett Country" being now out of date&#160;;-) ).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:38, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, you're both right. However, I do think that adding additional languages to the beginning of an article is valid when either a) They're truly official (e.g. Nouveau-Brunswick) or b) they add interesting information, rather than simply being a translation. That second, for instance, means that when we talk about Grand Falls, there's no use listing "Grand-Sault" (simple translation), while when we talk about the village of Meteghan River in Nova Scotia, it might be valid to mention the French name "La Butte", because it clearly comes from a different origin and thus gives truly different information. That's why I dropped by to place this note, though. Bobanny, you removed the Irish word for <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> from the beginning of that article's opening sentence. I disagree - The Irish word means (I believe) "Land of Fish", not newly found land, or some such rough translation. That's why it's worth including, while, say, the Spanish or Japanese (or, in this case, the French) is not. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 16:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that in pre-Columbus/Cabot days apocryphal voyages such as the Zimchni/Sinclair one and other spoke of a "Great Ireland", Magna Irlandia, and also a huge island called Frisia, somewhere in the North Atlantic at the same latitude as the British Isles; strikes me that one was Nfld, the other Scotia. Unless a southern counterpart to Iceland collapsed beneath the waves without anyone noticing <i>something</i> (like, say, a big wave wiping out the Bay of Biscay in the 1400s....<i>waitaminit!!</i>.....). More on this later; I think that's pretty interesting; there's also a Hungarian poet, writing in Latin, who was on one of the fur trade voyages/explorations (Frobisher's I think); I used to have his epic <i>New Found Land</i> (<i>Terra Nova</i> or maybe in the genetive <i>Terrum Novis</i>?? - gave it to my classics prof so can't reference it here...).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 09:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, my Newfoundland change was promptly reverted. I agree with your examples, but as points of information that add something to the article, not as an obligatory inclusion in the first sentence with no context. There's actually a discussion on Nfld's talk page about the name and as someone who doesn't know all that much about that province, it was interesting to read (the Portuguese name is "Codfish"). The French name for BC ain't so interesting, inasmuch as it's simply a French translation. For a subject as big as a province, there's so much information that could be included that what does go in needs to be carefully selected for the contribution it makes, and arbitrarily having other language versions, without any context, is pointless. Newfoundland's name, btw, is discussed in the main text of the article, but there's a lot that is left out, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Newfoundland_Constabulary_d2a9.html" title="Royal Newfoundland Constabulary">Royal Newfoundland Constabulary</a> for example, the oldest police force in Canada, isn't mentioned. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%27s_name.html" title="Canada's name">Canada's name</a> has it's own article, as a point of reference, and Nfld could probably justify the same. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 17:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An article, or a section on the BC history page, to give a rundown on why it's called British Columbia and what else it or parts of it were called might be a good thing, huh?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More thoughts on this: if the French is going to be there, it should have the definite article <i>la colombie-brittanique</i> (doesn't work without the <i>la</i>)...and technically it's also lower-case I think; having it in brackets and not used as if it was a phrase used in English (which is how it was before the brackets) helps take out some of its obtrusiveness; and as I pointed out, not that francophones who use it care, it's not an accurate or historically-correct translation anyway. And it's still not the "alternate name" of BC - that's the Dogwood Province/Pacific Province. Other provinces get off easy because they're untranslateable, or the French form resembles the English....except for one thing: that damned thing with the article. <i>So</i> if BC has to have a French-alternate form of its name, shouldn't that be applied across the board? So the Alberta page should have a first sentence set of brackets saying "Fr: <i>l'Alberta</i>", Saskatchewan would be <i>le Saskatchewan</i>, Manitoba <i>le Manitoba</i>, Ontario is <i>l'Ontario</i>. It's only fair isn't it that everybody else be subjected to officially-bilingual irrelevancies if BC has to be? Still can't understand why the Latin "Nova Scotia" has to get translated at all....and isn't PEI's "franco-correct" name actually Ile-Royale, not Ile de Prince-Edouard? They don't translate the names of Moose Jaw and Medicine Hat or Salmon Arm; why do they insist on doing it to "British Columbia"? I know the answer, and I can only think of how this sounds to those from east of the Granite Curtain: an reincarnation of Bill vanderZalm and the cornflakes boxes. But the Zalm had a point; not that he wanted to see Dutch instead (there are still more Dutch speakers in BC than there are francohpones, btw)...<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:56, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Might as well ask you, since I just dropped by your Deadman's Island page and almost plunked a BC Wikiproject tag on its talk page, as I've been doing with other Vancouver project articles. Is this redundant? Most of us working on the BC project are also (so far) on the Vancouver Wikiproject; is there a hierarcy to be observed here, even though the BC project is more a child of the Vancouver one than the other way around?? Wondering if it constitutes "template clutter". Which of the project's talk pages would it maybe have been better to post this on, also; I'm not sure where the general message area is.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; saw your change. Now let's just hope I got it in the right gender; instinctively the <i>-ie</i> ending is feminine, but not necessarily. I'll check over in le carnard enchaine to see if they capitalize it or not; probably do in titles, like in the infobox, but I'm not so sure about straight text. Now, do you think we should go ahead and add the French forms of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Ontario, Manitoba? And while we're at it put "(English: Quebec)" (w/o the accent) in the first line of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> article...oh that was premature; they have the English form first, and in the title, without the accent. Now if we can only get that procedure/model recognize for St'at'imc, Nuxalk and other First Nations articles where the name is in their language and spelling system, with characters such as accented vowels English doesn't have and all that superscript/subscript stuff that had been in <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squamish_Nation_85d8.html" title="Squamish Nation">Squamish Nation</a>'s evil twin Skwuxuxmesh or whatever it was...(see <a href="../../../s/q/u/Talk%7ESquamish_Nation_f476.html" title="Talk:Squamish Nation">Talk:Squamish Nation</a> and while you're at it check <a href="../../../k/w/a/Talk%7EKwakiutl_fa90.html" title="Talk:Kwakiutl">Talk:Kwakiutl</a> and the corresponding <a href="../../../k/w/a/Talk%7EKwakwaka%27wakw_1329.html" title="Talk:Kwakwaka'wakw">Talk:Kwakwaka'wakw</a> pages).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 09:13, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bobbany and Skokum - I believe my latest version is shorter, more precise, and more up to the point. It is not important to point out data that Stanley Park is 16th in the place. That's simply not true. I mean, the agency selected ugly Mexican park to be #1 in the world, and that park doesn't even have 1/3 of features and beauty of Stanley Park. The agency has discredited itself and we should not quote it. How can one put ugly, dirty, Mexican park on #1 place and Stanley Park on the 16th place? It's ridicolous. I strongly oppose information from discredited agencies to be included into Stanley Park article. I've been in Mexico and seen the ugly dirty park they selected as "#1 Park in the World", and it can't even be compared with our Stanley Park. Don't include that info, as by doing that - you are only insulting the most beautiful park in the Universe (Stanley Park!).</p>

<p>Hi; I seem to be the only regular BC Wikipedian to take an an interest in this article; which has been edited and vetted by users with iP addresses in Ontario and Quebec (almost none from BC). Please see my response to User:IWin4U on <a href="../../../b/c/_/Talk%7EBC_Legislature_Raids_dcf4.html" title="Talk:BC Legislature Raids">Talk:BC Legislature Raids</a> under "Article should be deleted" (which of course it shouldn't be).

I'm <i>very</i> suspicious about the identity of many of the "contributors" to this page, and think we should have a POV watch or current-events tag placed on this article because of its importance on the one hand, and its volatility on the other.

<dd>Further to previous: I just looked at User:IWin4U's "just a little fact-checking" edits on the aticle and it's clear to me that User:IWin4U "has an agenda"; note the deletions of anything to do with Mark Marissen or Erik Bornman, and the pretense that rather than this case being wrapped in mystery that "it's the largest disclosure of evidence in BC history" or however he/she put it - definitely a soft-soaping of the content; likewise the changing of "Sale of BC Rail Deal information" to "BC Rail link", even though the controversy surrounding the sale of BC Rail now appears to be one of the central facts of the case (whose full context remains unknown to the public). The article reads very poorly, in fact, because of its vagueness and the avoidance of major issues relating to the case. I'm extremely suspicious now of User:IWin4U's identity because of the edits in question; which included the deletion of the Tyee and BC Mary blog links as well as the link to the puffpiece on Dave Basi from the Globe; BC Mary's blog is the major independent news site relating to this story; I'll be putting her back once I research a few more edits/information to add here; oh hell, I'm putting her back <i>now</i>, as User:IWin4U could have no other reason to delete her link than because he doesn't like the questions here blog is asking <i>and continues to ask</i>. Questions which none of the mainstreams reporters (e.g. Keith Baldrey ever ask, or pat-dismiss whenever confronted with them.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:29, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your kind words. We are all trying our best to assume good faith and be civil I think. It's quite impressive. It does nothing to fight the stereotype that Canadians are polite!&#160;;). There is always a bit of a conflict I think, about how deeply you can be involved in a dispute and use your admin tools. But I don't think this situation requires any call to a "higher power". You called it exactly right in you very first post to the talk page. It's not a content dispute. Therefore, we move on and edit. We get to <i>work</i>.

<p>PS because you've read as much or more BC history as I have (although I get the impression more 20th C. than 19th) I'm coming to you first out of the BC Wikipedians (other than Mkdw, who's an admin SFAIK) about vandalism-deletes to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chinese_immigration_to_Canada_ef7c.html" title="History of Chinese immigration to Canada">History of Chinese immigration to Canada</a> committed by <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">User:HongQiGong</a>, who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, or appreciate that the stuff he doesn't like is actually real and very citable and in all major BC historical works as well as throughout local histories in Lillooet, Yale, Barkerville et al.

(from Morton) as well as various other details, esp. concerning the gold rush and the economic profile of Chinese merchants/wealth in the colony/early province, but I see no point in adding material when an ethnic-POV vandal (who's habitually insulting, which gives his claim on my talk page that I'm into pesonal attacks all the more cutting a sense of...irony is it?) is just going to keep on deleting it.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)\</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply on <a href="../../../s/k/o/User_talk%7ESkookum1_940d.html" title="User talk:Skookum1">my talkpage</a>; I'll be avoiding doing anything, but just asked another friendly BC Wikipedian (who's Chinese) to help me with the material; I'd planned on writing very nice articles about the Chinatowns in Barkerville, Richfield, Lillooet, Omineca, Fort Ware, Cumberland and more; but there's lots of other more worthwhile things to do; I was trying to flesh out the gold rush section, which was pitiful and entirely incorrect when I found it. I've posted disengagement notices with Mkdw and on Hong's talkpage, and will do so if he adds another round of insults/snipes here; I learned my lesson about process, even though the process was wrong: Hong's breaking all kinds of rules, including 3RR as well as the harrassment stuff, so I'll deal with him the way things are supposed to be dealt with. I'll compile my cites and text on a sandbox page and maybe field them through you or my other contact (whose username I won't post here, as Hong is monitoring my User Contributions, it seems...) before posting them; they're all very interesting and worthwhile, and worthy encyclopedically as well as in other senses. Hong lives in Hong Kong, and quite honestly I don't think he cares or knows anything about Canada or BC except what he's been told...I have many vices, and it's true <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconoclast.html" title="Iconoclast">iconoclasty</a> is definitely one of them...I get an overpowering sense of "needing to restore truth" when I see things that have been changed, or written, that are <i>outright WRONG</i>.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just happened to see the Vancouver Portal's feature item on Deadman's Island and noticed this line:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>According to Pauline Johnson the Squamish name is "Island of the Dead Men".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is that in <i>Legends of Vancouver</i>? I'm curious because if she said the <i>Indian name</i> she could well be meaning the Chinook version, which is the standard for any graveyard - <i>Memaloose Illahee</i> (there is no word for "island"; memaloose simply means dead, as well as dead men or dead anything). If it's Squamish language, I'd be curious to know what it is and of course it should be cited here (it's occurred to me to do a List of aboriginal placenames in Greater Vancouver so we could get Lucklucky, Eeyulshun, Mahlie, Snauq, Homulchesan etc all in the same place; would have to be a combination of Maj. Matthews/frontier spellings, official Squamish orthography, and IPA (as Wiki requires IPA for non-English stuff), but it's an interesting thought, no? Also meant to comment on something in the start of the history section of the main Vancouver article (or is it the BC article?) about the two "islands" mentioned by Capt. Vancouver; couldn't have been Deadman's Island as he couldn't see it from Qwhy-qwhy; all other interpretations of that text I've seen interpret it as meaning the downtown peninsula as the larger of the two islands, and Stanley Park <i>in toto</i> as the smaller one "in front of" the other; at that time tidal water could wash through the swamp connecting approx. Alexander &amp; Columbia to Columbia &amp; Pender...it's hard to wrap your head around now, but southern Strathcona used to be waterfront property - very nice waterfront property, apparently, until False Creek got filled in with rock from the blasting of the Fraser Canyon and Rockies....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 03:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Skwxwu7mesh do have a name for that island, and it is historically been a grave island. Those initial reports of finding bones with hair wrapped around with broken boxes; that's how our burial ceremonies happened. As for the name, I'm not exactly sure, but I'll find some of the papers that have place-names on it.</dd>
<dd>And if you do a list of place-names, I have papers and papers full of names. Places like Lumberman's Arch, Second Beach, Spanish Banks, Kitsilano, all around False Creek, then included place on the North Shore. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldManRivers_9151.html" title="User:OldManRivers">OldManRivers</a> 01:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The cite on the page for the bit about Deadman's Island is Eric Nicol; I'm sure Matthews says something different, and also MacDonald (<i>Vancouver: A Visual History</i>, which I still have); I just got the Akriggs back from a loan to a friend (<a href="http://www.fortlangley.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.fortlangley.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.fortlangley.ca</a> which is the homesite for "Children of Fort Langley", an organization of HBC/First Nations/Kanaka descendants of employees/residents of the fort) and I suspect there's something in them (the Akriggs). I've just picked up from the Burnaby PL a book called <i>People of the Harrison</i> which has all kinds of juicy detail gleaned from (referenced) sources, and in the course of reading it I was reminded that <i>memaloose</i> can also mean "to kill" (I'm used to seeing that in the construction <i>mamook memaloose</i> - although the transitive auxiliary <i>mamook</i> meaning "do, make" was habitually omitted in spoken Chinook, which was famously laconic). The Harrison book has lots of nice details about the Chehalis and Scowlitz peoples as well as Harrison Mills and Port Douglas. Already have some books which are as yet un-mined for articles, e.g. <i>Ghost Towns of British Columbia</i>, but I picked up a few similar <i>Dead and Drowned Towns of the West Kootenay</i>, for instance (did you know there was a Brooklyn, BC?). Also fascinating stuff on the Scowlitz Mounds and the theorized pre-Sto:lo people who built them, and about their excavations by Charles Hill-Tout in the 1930s; there's new digs on them lately but I don't know the results.....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the note.

You might try tracking down his family. See you at the museum sometime. Cognoscento 20:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Most disturbingly of all, however, which should be added to your sock report, is that rascalpatrol's sig on the AFD, and in the talkpage, doesn't go to <b><a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERascalpatrol_d018.html" title="User:Rascalpatrol">User:rascalpatrol</a></b> but rather to <b>User:rascalpatorl</b> (note difference in spelling - I noticed it originally which is how I wound up in my trouble from <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERascalpatrol_a2e6.html" title="User talk:Rascalpatrol">User talk:rascalpatrol</a> - as I figured out how to <i>get</i> to his talk page - as it can't be gotten to unless you realize the spelling change). He must be hand-typing it in rather than using the four-tildes sig method, in which case it's a deliberate deception.

<dd>Yeah, noticed him and a few others that looked to be one-off accounts, but not of the Friends of Bornmann variety. Apparently, sock incidents more than 4 days old, or something like that, aren't worth investigating, so I tried to keep it to the ones related to the AfD, and only mentioned the older ones to indicate a longer-term pattern. I don't think Wikipedia has the capacity to deal with fly-by-night users effectively, i.e., in many cases it's more efficient to just revert as with vandalism generally, than go through the tedious reporting process. But I am curious to see what becomes of my squealing. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 17:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi. No doubt you've seen Omar Jack's latest post, and Rich_H's, attacking me. I know these guys are trying to bait me into getting blocked again, but it ain't gonna happen. I'm wondering what to do about Omar Jack's personal attack on me, to whit that I am one of the people charged in the case etc. Obviously a violation of Wikiquette - but is there much point in getting a sockpuppet blocked? Also, not sure which of the many possible arenas to file a complaint with Wikidom is, off the various possiblites on WP:ANI. That personal attacks are being made in the course of an AFD by the same "people" who made personal attacks throughout the history of the article/talkpage strikes me as very ugly; I think they've realized they can't wantonly delete other people's posts on the AFD, as they were doing so consistently in the article, so it seems that they're doing "attack for attack". I'm disengaging, except for my latest rejoinder to Omar Jack's complaint about the stubbornness of my principles; I'm sure everyone else, other than the sockpuppets, saw the irony in his bleat but being a Scorp and all....it's amazing that "people" who've posted under 10 times on Wikipedia each are presuming to lecture "us" on what is and isn't acceptable content. If Mr. Bornmann and his allies are worried about someone discrediting his credibility/character in advance of the trial, no one could be doing a better job of that than they are doing themselves by such behaviour. Anyway, your suggestions about what to do about personal-attack-by-sockpuppet; should I go WP:ANI or would these comments warrant mention on the Sockpuppet Notice/Discussion (which you'll note none of them have sought to say anything on, other than complaining about it on the AFD)?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 00:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi on a different topic; just in the process of trying to whip up a Userbox for WikiProject BC members, and may make a stab at certain templates I think are needed. I posted about this on the project's talkpage but I'm getting the feeling that no one else has that page on their watchlist, as I've never gotten a reply there to anything.

<dd>Also, thinking of migrating some of the content from the Buchanan-Hermit sandbox to the project pages, e.g. the category hierarchy and other structural stuff. Thoughts?

<p>Made a stab at a userbox; check 'er out: <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_WikiProject_British_Columbia_2ba5.html" title="Template:User WikiProject British Columbia">Template:User WikiProject British Columbia</a> (use {{User WikiProject British Columbia}} ). Fudged around with the colours and borders for a while, tried to use colours taken from the dogwood but wound up blue-adjusting the background, not quite happy with the bkgnd colour but it's better than the grey-transparent on the Vancouver userbox. Trying to think which stubs are needed; I think one for mountain and moutain range stubs (there'll be hundreds of these...), though the dogwood won't do for that; could use it for parks stubs, though, no? There's already a protected area stub that has a thing from the US Southwest on it; might as well replace it with the dogwood (d'ya like the dogwood? It's from Wikimedia Commons...I thumbed it down though). Trying to remember which other stubs are needed....bio-stub I guess for biographies, I'm thinking one for communities/settlements, have to think what else.

<p>Just had a quick look at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and, while the personal attacks thing re their saying I'm someone involved in the trial is a doozy, what caught my eye was <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Now, filing a complaint about this would mean fingering rascalpatrol as so-and-so, and now Tompettyfan as the other so-and-so, and you're not supposed to "out" people's real ID in Wikipedia. But admins, or someone, could confirm that they are who they're pretending not to be, as I doubt they were smart enough to sign up under "mask" email accounts, more probably under their own regular email addresses; but esp. with Tompettyfan it's very clear from his edits that he's a Liberal. And it's very clear that rascalpatrol is a Liberal. Seems like pretty clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> but it's not as if they are abiding by any other Wikipedia guidelines, so why start now, huh? I guess the forum is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard</a> but I'm not sure if you have to be an admin to post there.</p>
<p>They're all chiming in on "delete" now, you'll notice, as I'd said that deleting the article would wipe the edit history. I don't think that's the case, as ultimately everything is archived <i>somewhere</i>, but it was interesting to say that and then watch them change their tune from "redirect" (and rascalpatrol's disigenuous "neutral") to "delete". Jammy Simpson contributes on comic books and sci-fi, by the look of his edit contribs (and <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavarian_porn.html" title="Bavarian porn">Bavarian porn</a>, whatever that is)..</p>
<p>Gotta actually go do some real life stuff....hunting around for a mountain-pic to use for the BritishColumbia-mountains-stub and replaced all the geo-stubs for communities/localities in the A and B sections of the geo-stub's category with the communities-stub (that's all so far). Also going to draft up a sandbox version of Dave Basi, and also one for EB; I'd post the link here but I don't know if you are, or I am, having my edit contributions watched. I'm not sure they're that smart about Wikitricks, maybe.....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 00:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Haven't done much on the sandbox thing, but again don't want to post its link here...when I've got some of it done, based on what's been deleted as well as various links KenWalker and JGGardiner have provided - also a Dave Basi page - I'll let you know; at that point I'll ask you to email me and I'll send you the link that way, if you'd care to review the material. <i>Then</i> we pull an ambush; zap a big edit on the page, put up a call for full protection; one of the sockpuppets will try and delete/revert the changes but the 3RR rule will kick in; but again they can always create another sock, but by the time they do hopefully the Protect request will have come into force; the Basi page will also have to be protected, as also the Ledge Raids page. They already hate me. They might as well have a good reason to...off to the gym, to "get back in my body" - been inside my head because of all this too much these last few days, if you know what I mean...but darn gosh it's gross outside, huh?.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 04:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sigh. I was trying to <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7Ebe_bold_3a70.html" title="WP:be bold">be bold</a> with my new stubs for the BC WikiProject, but I seem to have stepped on procedure/guidelines again; as per <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Skookum1#British_Columbia_stub_types|notice" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Skookum1#British_Columbia_stub_types|notice" rel="nofollow">on my talkpage</a> so will be having to deal with the SFD in the next few days; apology, plus making requests to get them made. I didn't know the stuff about the geo-stubs being automatically inclusive of this or that and how it can't be subdivided for mountains etc.....but it seems to me that the reality of the BC landscape can't really be comprehended by "flatlanders", and the Wiki rule sets weren't made with situations like ours; I swear there are mountains than people in this province!! Even named peaks here outnumber those in WA, OR, ID and CA <i>combined</i>, and that's not including unnamed ones. Just <i>named</i> mountain ranges along number in the hundreds. Likewise, BC has more ghost towns than the rest of British Columbia put together, and that's not even including "phantom" towns (promotions that never materialized, or which vanished within a few weeks); and we've got hundreds of small rural Indian Reserves and also non-native localities which are distinct if tiny; couldn't be lumped into an article on town two valleys and fifty miles away, for example.... And the reason for the bio-stub I wanted is because our particular history is very much one of individuals - "characters" - (rather than classes, genders or ethnic groups, but there's that previous discussion of ours I never got back to!). Bios of guys like <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanic_Brown_cf08.html" title="Volcanic Brown">Volcanic Brown</a>, Gustavus Blin Wright etc. - <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gassy_Jack_4d62.html" title="Gassy Jack">Gassy Jack</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Murray_e2e5.html" title="Ma Murray">Ma Murray</a> would fall into this category, if there articles weren't already not-stubs; I think I left <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_XII_aacf.html" title="Brother XII">Brother XII</a> as a stub, even though it's got some content - it could use a lot more (if you don't know who he was, have a quick read...). In the pioneer era many of these guys can get the politician stub - Frank Barnard of the <a href="../../../b/2E/x/B.X._Express_d9f8.html" title="B.X. Express">B.X. Express</a>, or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_George_Vernon_9d4c.html" title="Forbes George Vernon">Forbes George Vernon</a>. These were just guys who wound up as MLAs, MPs, just for a term or two; not professional pols; but because they got elected they get the politician stub. I'm not wanting everyone and everything to be a stub....I'm just aware of exactly how big the potential article infrastructure thing is for BC, given the complexity of our history, population and geography. Oh, speaking of which what did you think of the Local History WikiProject? And if you wouldn't mind, could you have a look at my comments on the Talkpage at Category:Scandinavian British Columbians?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further to previous, here's my SFD statements on these; any comments/support you might have would be welcome. I'll post a similar remark on the Wikiproject page and also next to the templates themselves....I was going to create an "islands-stub", too, given how many of the damned things we have...as also with the mountains-stub, which isn't listed as an SFD (yet, but it seems it might be). <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_types_for_deletion_Log_2007_January_6_7518.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion/Log/2007/January/6">Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion/Log/2007/January/6</a> <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bobanny, I just wanted to thank you for your continuous dedication to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/P%7EV_7a63.html" title="P:V">Vancouver Portal</a> and the <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVancouver_14fe.html" title="WP:Vancouver">WikiProject Vancouver</a>, as well as its relating articles. Thank you also for supporting my changes to the project, together, along with the other contributors we have accomplished much in the last couple of months. Its nice to have a friend. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 06:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah you're right Bobanny, in my growing frustration I didn't notice all the other users who are helping with the issue, thanks for your message. I agree with the idea of leaving him alone and just tagging him as he vandalises. I just hope he stops leaving messages on my talk page before I <a href="../../../k/e/t/WP%7EKETTLE_583e.html" title="WP:KETTLE">Kettlise</a> him, which is what I'm worried about. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 21:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Touch-ups on the article welcome of course.

<p>Hi; although I know you own Morley I wanted to let you know I served up some on <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldManRivers_0e5d.html" title="User talk:OldManRivers">User talk:OldManRivers</a> as he was interested in a certain passage to do with Moody's freeing of slaves as part of the land-survey of Burrard Inlet that was conducted by Moberley and Burnaby, with themselves and Moody and Admiral Baynes being the chief benefactors; one of the dirtiest colonial-era scandals, to be sure, but no newspapers around so no handy title to use for an article (the allocations were reversed due to obvious conflict-of-interest, with colonial politicians denoucning the "military clique" that had taken prime land for itself, by dint of Moody's sweeping powers as, jointly, head of the military in the colony, Commissioner/Minister of Public Works, and also Minister/Commissioner of Lands, i.e. responsible for the first land law, which is what these surveys were in fact the first application of, overturned as they were; but that and some details about First Nations in Stanley Park and elsewhere are on OldManRivers' talkpage, and include bits of other detail which might be useful for other articles, esp. in fact <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Vancouver_6293.html" title="History of Vancouver">History of Vancouver</a>....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you have “no opinion” then why do you keep reverting back to an inaccurate version? I most certainly don’t want an edit war either - all I want is for the information to be accurate and displayed in an appropriate way. If you look at similar pages then you’ll see that by far the most common arrangement is for English cities to be listed with only the English flag, Scottish cities with only the Scottish flag and so on. Let’s leave it for a while with only the Scottish flag and if anyone objects - which appears to be your concern - then we can discuss as it happens. To not edit a page simply because you fear someone might object is no reason not to change it! <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanaye_61e0.html" title="User:Kanaye">Kanaye</a> 20:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Bobanny, the length of your statement on FAR was approximately half of the extra text I felt was necessary to improve the Vancouver article. I do not demand a fully detailed chronicle of the past 75 years (this belongs into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Vancouver_6293.html" title="History of Vancouver">History of Vancouver</a>), just a short summary. This can't be that difficult. Why do you think that something else has to be deleted as compensation? Does it really make a difference if the lenght of the article is 78 KB instead of 76 KB? I will not contribute to this article because this should be done by someone who knows the city and I am already busy enough expanding the German version (that's the reason I actually started bothering, I just felt that something is missing). Now that <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a> has removed the article from FAR for "technical" reasons: Am I allowed to post it on Peer Review instead? --<a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoyager_ch_f521.html" title="User:Voyager ch">Voyager</a> 12:45, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
