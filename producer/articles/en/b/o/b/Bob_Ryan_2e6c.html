<p>In the fall of 1969 a vacancy on the <i>Globe'</i>s Celtics beat was created, and Ryan would take that job. While covering the Celtics Ryan would have a close relationship with the Celtics organization. Ryan would even go out to dinner with the team.<sup id="_ref-GB1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GB1" title="">[5]</a></sup> Ryan would sit at the press table 8 seats from the Celtics' bench, where colleagues referred to him as the "Commissioner," not unlike <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Gammons_7810.html" title="Peter Gammons">Peter Gammons</a>'s nickname. Boston Sports Media critic Bruce Allen<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> has said, "his passion is not faked."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>One night Hue Hollins, the referee, went to the press table to explain a call to Ryan during a time-out even though he was not obligated to. Another time Ryan wrote a column about the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Bullets_a2f4.html" title="Washington Bullets">Washington Bullets</a>' <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Mahorn_4282.html" title="Rick Mahorn">Rick Mahorn</a> and how he played dirty under the hoop. When Mahorn was called for a foul Gene Shue, the Bullets' coach, turned around and said, "that's your fault, Bob Ryan, your fault!" <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Johnson_dcba.html" title="Dennis Johnson">Dennis Johnson</a> was often annoyed with Ryan and would go up to the press table and say, "hey, Bob, keep it down. We got a game going on here" when Ryan sideline coached.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup> From Ryan's first column on <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Bird_e80c.html" title="Larry Bird">Larry Bird</a> headlined "Celtics draft Bird for oh what a future" to his last "Larry! Larry! Larry!" Ryan was always a fan of his and eventually co-authored a book with him.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Tom (Tommy) Heinsohn's book <i>Give 'em the Hook</i>, Heinsohn is negative towards Ryan. Ryan, who began writing for the <i>Globe</i> in Heinsohn's rookie season as a coach, would make friends with the players and vent their feelings towards Heinsohn, their fans, and their teammates, claims Heinsohn. Heinsohn didn't like how he didn't feel in control of his team. Heinsohn believes that Ryan started to "think of himself as another member of the family" and that he even started coaching the team through his beat stories. Heinsohn goes on to talk about Ryan's bloated ego and the fact that he was then thinking of himself as a basketball guru. Heinsohn also says while noting disapproval of Ryan that at the time anyone who lived in Boston and even remotely followed basketball read Bob Ryan.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> In recent years Ryan has been less critical of Celtics coaches, including <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Rivers_4522.html" title="Doc Rivers">Doc Rivers</a>, of whom he said, "I'm a Doc guy,"<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup> even though he is not well liked in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1982 Ryan would hand the torch that is the <i>Globe</i> Celtics beat to then-not well known <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Shaughnessy_bb02.html" title="Dan Shaughnessy">Dan Shaughnessy</a>, and later <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_MacMullan_265d.html" title="Jackie MacMullan">Jackie MacMullan</a>. He did this in order to go to <a href="../../../w/c/v/WCVB_996b.html" title="WCVB">WCVB</a> for a couple of years. Ryan ended up hating it and moved back to the Celtics beat in 1984 for two more seasons before getting promoted to general sports columnist in 1989.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 2003, Ryan appeared on <i>Sports Final</i>, a local sports talk show airing on <a href="../../../w/b/z/WBZ-TV_314a.html" title="WBZ-TV">WBZ-TV</a>. At that time, Ryan said that Joumana Kidd, the wife of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Nets_dd51.html" title="New Jersey Nets">New Jersey Nets</a> guard <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Kidd_8d49.html" title="Jason Kidd">Jason Kidd</a> needed someone to "smack" her for taking her son T.J., then 4 years old, to NBA play-off night games where they could be taunted.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup> He accused Joumana of being an exhibitionist and using the child as a prop to get television time. The show's host, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Lobel_81d3.html" title="Bob Lobel">Bob Lobel</a>, asked Ryan to retract his statement, but Ryan refused, saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>LOBEL:</b> You just don’t want to smack her. You don’t mean to say that.</dd>
<dd><b>RYAN:</b> Alright.</dd>
<dd><b>LOBEL:</b> I mean. Do you? Really, do you? Tell me you don’t.</dd>
<dd><b>RYAN:</b> Why should I say anything different here than I said all last playoffs last year?<sup id="_ref-GB2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GB2" title="">[15]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The comments struck a chord because in 2001, Joumana Kidd had been the victim of <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_abuse.html" title="Domestic abuse">domestic abuse</a> by her husband, Jason Kidd.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[16]</a></sup> Ryan would return to Boston to meet with executives at the <i>Globe</i>. Ryan later apologized, but the <i>Globe</i> still suspended him and barred him from television for one month. "Four weeks took my breath away. But I’ll abide by it," he later said.<sup id="_ref-GB2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GB2" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ryan would cover 20 <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_52b6.html" title="NBA">NBA</a> finals, 20 Final Fours, 9 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>, five <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowls</a>, the last 7 Olympics and many other events. In recent times Ryan has become less basketball-oriented and more general sports-oriented. He has also written for the <i>Basketball Times</i>.

<li>Ryan contributes to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Felger_c9c8.html" title="Michael Felger">Michael Felger</a>'s show.

<p>At 60, Ryan wants his retirement from the job to be graceful: "I’m not bitter. I enjoy my job and I still think I do it well, but they are chipping away, chipping away and they are making it far less pleasurable. I want to get out when I feel like getting out. If you stay around too long, there is no way you can dictate your terms," he said. Ryan also asked, "How do you explain to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_A._Smith_b9ff.html" title="Stephen A. Smith">Stephen A. Smith</a> that he has no idea of the game and how much fun it was? He thinks he knows everything, but he will never know what I know about the Celtics."<sup id="_ref-GB1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GB1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ryan is a history major from Boston College (class of 1968). He went to high school at The Lawrenceville School from 1960 to 1964. He and his wife Elaine have two children and are proud grandparents of triplets. They have been married since 1969.
