<p>Hi, I didn't realize this was such a contenteous issue. I can certainly understand your position, though. I live in Seattle, love my home city, and can't stand grunge music. ( I'm a hip hop fan. ) On the other hand, we're extremely well associated with the trend, and as I said, a Nirvana album was printed on the cover of a NY Times Finance section, so I thought I was doing something positive by pointing these associations out on the Seattle page. I'll defer to your experience here, as you have eons more than I do on Wikipedia. Just please understand I made these changes trying to help. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattleChronic_4b1d.html" title="User:SeattleChronic">SeattleChronic</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattleChronic_9c22.html" title="User talk:SeattleChronic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SeattleChronic_f958.html" title="Special:Contributions/SeattleChronic">contribs</a>) 23:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Hi, Bob,</p>
<p>I've responded to your suggestions at Criticism of Quebec Society or whatever the hell it's called these days. I hope I've been able to clarify that I'm not rejecting your opinions out of hand (I go on about this at some length). I noticed you're from Seattle, so I'll add here that you might expect a little testiness on this issue from a <i>petit gars de <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Henri_55c3.html" title="Saint-Henri">Saint-Henri</a> émigré</i>. From Canadians, generally, actually. The only thing that keeps us together is that every part of the country hates some other part, and everybody hates Toronto. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 23:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, we're still disagreeing about Quebec, but I would like to thank you for alerting me to the grey areas in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I agree the policy's intentions are good, but as I've said on the talk page there, further specification of what constitutes inappropriate inference is required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have always agreed with the policy in general. For example, i seem to recall <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductive_education.html" title="Conductive education">Conductive education</a> and related articles being extensively modified by their original poster after I pointed out some NOR-related issues. And I put an NOR tag on an article just the other day.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, although progress seems to be glacial, i think the discussion about criticism of Quebec society has helped clarify issues. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 13:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't aware of that rule, I'll keep it in mind next time. As for the editing, I was just trying to help, but I guess I was hurting more than I was helping. I am pretty sure that Seattle has a Mediterranean climate by definition, because for an oceanic or maritime climate (Cfb or Cwb), there has to be little to no difference between seasons. A Mediterranean climate (Csa or Csb) specifically has a driest month with less than 1/3 of the precipitation of the wettest month, in addition to hot (or warm in Seattle's case), dry summers, and cool, wet winters. As for the temperatures, I've heard a lot of different averages, and it veries from place to place, so those are just the averages I felt were most accurate, though I could be wrong. Anyway, sorry again to case trouble, but thanks for welcoming me nonetheless. <a href="../../../g/s/1/User%7EGS121389_653f.html" title="User:GS121389">GS121389</a> 01:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bobblehead; I looked at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Talk%7ESeattle%2C_Washington_2730.html" title="Talk:Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a> this morning to see if there was a consensus for the change that I proposed, expecting to make whatever changes to the article that seemed appropriate.

<p>Hi, Bobblehead,</p>
<p>Discussion about OR at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EControversy_over_criticism_of_Quebec_society_9531.html" title="Talk:Controversy over criticism of Quebec society">talk:Controversy over criticism of Quebec society</a> seems to have died out, unfortunately. However, you have converted me into a devotee of NOR. Although I still think the criteria are too broad, it's obvious there are many articles here which really are original research and consequently unencyclopedic (I was heartened to see that one of the worst transgressors, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_English_79ce.html" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>, has been flagged). Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any fields on Wikipedia which you think may require special attention because of the prevalence of OR; I've been thinking of going on a tear among the articles about entertainers, many of which read like press releases (which most probably are). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 14:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bobblehead. You reverted an edit of mine adding what I thought were relevant links to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> page, labelling them as "link spam". I put them there because I honestly thought they were relevant--they are sites to which I send friends and family who are visiting town--so I'd be most grateful if you could clarify what distinguishes those links as spam and the others in the same section as appropriate.

<p>In some articles on public transportation, I recently added some information and links about route planners based on text messaging. Reading the strict policy on external links, I see that some of these additions were in a gray area. It is not my intent to spam but to provide useful information, so please let me know how Wikipedia can provide this information appropriately. Riders of public transportation in particular cities want to know about two types of services, but information is nonexistant on Wikipedia. One type of service is web-based trip planners. The other type of service is similar but based on text messaging from mobile phones. The transit authorities typically provide the web-based service but merely encourage use of the text messaging services of other companies. If a rider of a particular transit authority's buses or trains needs information on the text messaging services, what is an acceptable way for Wikipedia to satisfy their need for such information? --rcauvin</p>

<dl>
<dd>The link you refer to in your revert request points to an old edit and therefor can not be reverted. I have refactored my comments so as to ensure they do not specifically attack anyone and are only comments of my learning experiences on Wikipedia since running into Travb.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My comments were in direct response to Travb's own comments, it is he that refuses to mediate and offered a lame compromise which in itself was not a compromise at all but an offer for me to agree to leave everything the way he has it. My statements are not personal attacks as at no time do I say I am talking about any editor specifically. I only state what I have learnt from Travb since I became an editor. At no time did I accuse anyone of being a sock puppet, my comment simply says that I know how to recognize one. Travb on the other hand continues to refer to me as a sock even though his case found no such evidence and I was vindicated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can read there are no personal attacks made towards Travb and therfor nothing to appologize for, if you wish to interpret my comments as negative towards Travb, then I suggest that it is only from your experience of seeing how he operates that you would be lead to such an assumption.</dd>

<p>hello, someone edited the link so that the notice was no visible to ordinary people typing in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>. This had the effect of removing the notice from view. The RFD was still there, but effectively invisible, since ordinary people would never see it unless they did a diff. What I've done is reverted this edit and made a note on the discussion page about it. Although I may have a difefreing view about what should be done than you do, I feel it is not a good idea to effectively reduce the opportunity of people to comment on the proposal whilst the dicussion is still ongoing. I'll be happy to see the discussion process come to a proper end and a decison reached and implemented, no matter what that particular decision is. As the proposer of the RfD, I thought I should alert you to this, and I hope I have not breached any guidelines in doing the reversion, as it has been my intention to act in good faith here. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 14:46, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was neutrally worded, non-inflammatory info regarding his law career that you deleted and replaced with less specific, somewhat inaccurate info. For example, he did continue to work for that firm part time after he became a state senator (but you deleted that...if Obama did it and applied for a job, he could get fired for hiding a job he had).

<p>I believe we have decided that the Liberian article ramains seperate and that we do not merge Firestone with Bridgestone. I think we have also covered what is POV and NPOV. I have made some changes to the article last night and today, adding a few images and cleaning up some of the duplicated statements. Please everyone have a look at the current article and offer your opinions.

<p>In May 2006, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Mission_in_Liberia_4180.html" title="United Nations Mission in Liberia">United Nations Mission in Liberia</a> (UNMIL) released a report detailing the state of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> on Liberia's rubber plantations. According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also noted that workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated since the houses were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s <a href="http://www.unmil.org/documents/political/liberiarubber.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unmil.org/documents/political/liberiarubber.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<dd>I removed this section because it has no source, this basically quotes from a document but the link provided does not exist. I have found a copy of the same document on <a href="http://www.stopfirestone.org/liberiarubber.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.stopfirestone.org/liberiarubber.pdf" rel="nofollow">StopFirestone.com</a>, however after reading through it, I can not find the statements that this section uses. The report does however say that the housing is being upgraded at the moment and the Bridgestone web site confirms this. The paragraph already exists within the Liberian article and does not need to be in here as well. The way I had it before was fine as it represented both sides equally. Your version has now shifted weight again by introducing statements that have no source and are therefor POV. <span style="font-weight: bold;padding: 2px;background-color: white;border: 1px solid green"><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01"><font size="2;" color="green"><b>Mobile 01</b></font></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User_talk%7EMobile_01_2f77.html" title="User talk:Mobile 01"><font color="red"><i><sup>Talk</sup></i></font></a></span> 04:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Intentionally or not, you are poisoning the atmosphere. When you attack me in the sockpuppetry case, does that make me want to compromise in articles? It would make most people angry and militant. Consider withdrawing putting a note asking that the matter be dropped and forgotten. In the past, both of us have stopped edit warring and let our level heads prevail. Let's do it this time.

<dd>Don't take it personal, Dereks1x, these things happen on Wikipedia. It may be completely coincidental that your edits are similar to the other users and the result of the SSP may completely exonerate you. The best thing you could do at this point is try to keep a level head, work out some compromise wording on the talk pages, and wait for a result. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 02:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RFCU done (I got the same advice at AN/I). We'll see, hopefully. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 03:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
