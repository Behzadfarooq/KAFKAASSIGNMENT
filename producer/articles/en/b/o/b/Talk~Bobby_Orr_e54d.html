<p><i>Bobby Orr is</i> considered <i>one of the greatest to ever play the game of hockey, after Wayne Gretzky of course.</i></p>
<p>It is my personal opinion that Bobby Orr could put Wayne Gretzky in his back pocket and skate away with him! Bobby Orr scored his points in a time when points were harder to come by and also it must be noted that when he(and the Bruins) began to run up the score on an opponent in a game he(or the Bruins) wouldn't rub it in by scoring as many points as he(and the Bruins) could have in order not to embarrass the opponent and also due to Bobby's personal modesty......according to Don Cherry on Hockey Night in Canada. Gretzky on the other hand was unembarrassable in his pursuit of points, going all out like a madman to the very end of each game trying with all his might to squeeze out that last point no matter what the score, often and mostly into an empty net! Mr Cherry also noted that the highest plus/minus rating Gretzky ever achieved was 89 while Bobby Orr regularly maintained a plus/minus in the 120's, the highest I believe -- according to Mr Cherry-- was a plus of 129 one year, and this in a time when they played about 10 fewer games in the regular season than what Gretzky would play! Add on about another 15% in extra games played and the equally resultant points, Orr would have had an astronomical 148 plus rating in his best season besting Gretzky by a truly incredible and astounding 59 more plus points rating. WE'RE TALKING A 66% DIFFERENCE HERE FOLKS!!!! THAT'S HOW MUCH BETTER ORR REALLY WAS FOLKS. NO JOKING AT ALL!!!! Orr played most of his career on one leg too and the great left winger Bobby Hull said that even on one leg Orr was way better than everybody else on two! Gordie Howe himself, one of the greatest 3 or 4 players to have ever laced up skates, said Orr was the best he'd ever seen. Orr incidentally said the same thing about Howe! Jean Beliveau said that Bobby Orr, when and if he made a mistake, recovered quicker and faster than any other player that he ever knew! It was not unusual for Bobby Orr to kill off a penalty all by himself either due to the fact that nobody could get the puck off of him when he got it, at least not very easily. It was said that Orr had 18 different speeds of fast leaving all the other skaters in the dust and could make impossibly tight turns. Bobby Orr was so great that he revolutioned the game and the defensemans position, something that can not be said about Mr Gretzky. Bobby Orr was the best bar none. 24.66.40.89 10:09, 12 December 2006 (UTC) Okay, I personally agree with that statement. I used to stay up way too late at night, watching the Bruins play hockey (those west coast games went on until midnight, Boston time), when I should have been getting a good night's sleep before my paper route.</p>
<p>And I'll never forget watching live as Bobby Orr scored the winning goal in May 1970, clinching the Stanley Cup 40 seconds into sudden-death overtime!!</p>
<p>But it's still just opinion. Let's leave it out *sigh*</p>

<dd>The statement "Bobby Orr is one of the greatest...." is opinion. The above statement is fact -- there are plenty of published opinions showing that he is considered by many to be one of the greatest, Gretzky being the greatest. Maybe adding "by many" after "considered" would clarify that. My favourite memory of Bobby Orr is those slow-motion rushes in which he'd skate the length of the ice at about five miles an hour and no one would come near him because they were afraid he'd make them look like fools. -- Anon 209.29.169.124</dd>

<p>I don't see it anywhere here, but I've read Orr had the best average for assists/game, at 1.31. (Of course, the '77 Guinness I saw it in also says Phil Espo had 7x100point seasons...)

<dd>Incorrect. Wayne Gretzky is the career leader with 1.320 assists per game, followed by Mario Lemieux (going into this season) with 1.145. Orr is third with .982, Peter Forsberg fourth with .905. Just a handful of other players (Coffey, Oates, Peter Stastny) broke .800. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:10, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wayne Gretzky is considered by MOST to be the greatest Hockey Player of All-Time.</p>

<dd>You are hardly presenting yourself as a paragaon of "gentlemanly" virtue here; you have engaged in sheer advocacy in the WG article, whereas my BO edits were defensible, fair, &amp; neutral. Therein lay the difference betwixt Ye and Thee. The fact that adherents of your cause such as Croat Canuck continue to vandalise both articles in the same redundant and biased manner speaks volumes about the agenda you have pursued thus far. It stops now in the interests of fairness and objectivity. WG was one of the greatest players of All Time, but he is not a god, or a religion. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrulyTory_da37.html" title="User:TrulyTory">TrulyTory</a> 14:13, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with RGTraynor and suggest Mediation before this gets any more venomous. "Croat Canuck continue to vandalise both articles in the same redundant and biased manner speaks volumes about the agenda you have pursued thus far." Whatever. I am far from an adherent from RGTraynor, as we've had our own arguments recently mostly about manner of international spelling between Canadian and American and had a few mini-edit wars. However, I can admit when he is right, and he is right in this instance. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> 20:51, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears this <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrulyTory_da37.html" title="User:TrulyTory">TrulyTory</a>'s sole purpose on Wikipedia is to take part in advocacy on behalf of Bobby Orr as the greatest hockey player of all-time. He's currently attempting to censor the relatively mild statement on the <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> page that Gretzky is considered by "many" (with appropriate and abundant citations) to be the greatest hockey player ever in a desperate attempt to advance the cause of Orr. Shamefully lame. If you are going to include "arguably the greatest of them all" (which is an opinion firmly in the minority) on Orr's page, then you have no right to object to Gretzky's page saying he is considered by many to be the greatest player ever (which is a view, coincidentally, held by...MANY...and supported with citations!) The short of it is that <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrulyTory_da37.html" title="User:TrulyTory">TrulyTory</a> is a POV-pusher in every sense.-R Esche 01:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There. If that's the language that's good enough for Wayne Gretzky, it surely is good enough -- and not one whit more or less POV, according to Tory and Pyles -- for Bobby Orr.

<dl>
<dd>it's not any better or worse than it was before, Traynor. My arguement the whole time has been that "greatest of all time" can never be determined...in any sport...so why bother. To include those words in 1 bio is just going to create edit wars for or against specific players over the title. And if it is going to be included in 1 bio then there's 15-20 other bios where the same words apply. As, I've posted before, the words "greatest of all time" do not appear in any bio in the Hockey Hall Of Fame...as it should be. Unless you can suddenly produce a 'way-back machine' and send some of today's modern stars back in time to go 1 on 1 against Eddie Shore...or try to score on a break-away against Bill Durnan. My own personal opinion on 'greatest of all time' is neither Orr nor Gretzky or Lemieux or Howe or Messier. But I have not injected those words into my favorite player's bio. You're always spouting about not using this place as a sandbox. But everytime you try to argue your case, you're just continuing to hand out pales and shovels. You'll figure it out someday...after this webpage eventually fades away. ~Mr Pyles</dd>

<p>While I decline to directly answer those who indulge in meatpuppetry, I agree that consistent spelling is a virtue.

<p>Was Harvey a fine point-gathering defenseman? Sure was, no question about it. Was he an all-time notable at it? Not remotely. Just counting Hall of Fame defenseman playing in the NHL contemporaneously with and before Harvey, he stands <b>twenty-fourth</b> in goals per game. No one would ever have described fellows like Lionel Conacher, Tim Horton, Red Horner, Allan Stanley or Ching Johnson as offensive defensemen, but they all scored more goals per game than did Harvey. Heck, Harvey just barely pipped Marcel Pronovost. Many contemporaries who aren't in the HHOF, such as Ott Heller, Glen Harmon, Doug Mohns and Flash Hollett, scored more goals a game than he did. Hell, even Al Dewsbury and Pat Egan managed that. Harvey didn't even lead his own team in points a full third of his career.</p>
<p>Red Kelly was a high scoring defenseman. Eddie Shore was a high scoring defenseman. But before I'd add Doug Harvey to the list, I'd add King Clancy and Hollett (who each had over half again as many goals as Harvey in half as many games played), Babe Pratt, Buck Boucher or Earl Siebert. The fact of the matter -- <i>fact</i>, mind you, not wishful thinking -- is that despite Harvey's legitimate claim to being the greatest defenseman of all time, he was not notable as an offensive force, either historically or during his own career. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 01:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wrong you are - again. Harvey controlled the pace of the game much like Orr, and when you consider the low-scoring of the 1950's, a Defenceman who tallied between 30 and 50 points a season is very good. Take 1955 as an example; Geoffrion led the league with 75 points. Harvey totalled 49 points. 65% of the leader's total. In '57 Howe led with 89 points, and Harvey totalled 50 points. In many ways, his seasons are not different than Red Kelly's - except Red scored more goals. Yet Harvey was judged superior to Kelly in terms of the Norris Trophy voting. Why is this? Because, he was judged to the a more "total" player than Kelly - as a defenceman. And Kelly was a great one. There is a triumvirate of great two-way defenders in NHL history, and they commonly go like this: 'Shore, Harvey, and Orr.' This has been the case among hockey men for decades. It is surprising that you find this so novel. Orr was NOT only a great scorer, but a great playmaker, a great defender, and a great fighter. Shore &amp; Harvey were the standard before Orr. Orr has been the standard ever since - and he didn't need Semenko to do his dirty work for him. Yeah, I threw that in for added measure... <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrulyTory_da37.html" title="User:TrulyTory">TrulyTory</a> 20:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely, Harvey's assist totals were "very good" by the standards of defensemen of his day ... although some might not consider having the likes of the Richards, Lach, Geoffrion, Moore and Beliveau finishing off your passes much of a hardship. Absolutely, Harvey was deemed superior to Kelly when it came to Norris voting. Yet how could that be, when Kelly outscored Harvey ten out of the thirteen seasons they played defense head-to-head? <i>Because Harvey was a superior defensive defenseman.</i> <b>Which is not what the section in question discusses.</b> What is surprising is not that I find the concept novel that Harvey was a great defenseman; that much is blindingly obvious. What is surprising is your insistence, wrapped in irrelevancies and straw man arguments, that he was one of the great offensive defensemen of all time. Which the evidence does not support, so failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. No doubt there are forums where your advocacy would be welcome and eagerly debated, but <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> applies here. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 00:06, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There you go again. Specious .... Orr was NOT just an Offensive Defenceman. He was a Two-Way Defenceman, as was Harvey. Harvey was a master with the puck in the transition zone, which allowed the Canadiens' forwards to move into the attack earlier in the sequence. It takes skill with the puck in order to do this. You keep falling back into Orr as "merely an offensive player" when he was not. He was a two-way Defenceman, who could and did control the TEMPO of the game and frame the attack - JUST LIKE HARVEY. I love King Clancy. I grew-up in Toronto where he was a living legend. But he is not talked about as the total transitionally dominant player that Shore, Harvey, and Orr were. Orr was about MORE than goals&#160;! Can you not understand that? <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrulyTory_da37.html" title="User:TrulyTory">TrulyTory</a> 13:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
