<p>Thanks for the pointer, but I've never seen "subhetrodyne" used anywhere else in any textbook or other reference material. It gets 0 Google hits (or did the last time I checked, yesterday). I'd prefer to squash this ugly and incorrect coinage as quickly as possible. Wikipedia articles unfortunately gets copied hundreds of times over on the Web and I'd prefer to have them accurate if at all possible. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 14:16, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>subhetrodyne</b> [sic] is <u>not the right spelling</u>, which probably accounts for the 0 hits. But I agree that it is unusual, and I understand your concern, particularly since <u>super</u> does indeed appear to historically derive from <u>super</u>sonic. Or maybe in this century it is time to start putting that archaic modifier to more practical use. Just a thought.</p>

<dd>Yes. I am used to separating sentences by 2 spaces, as I was taught long ago in high school. I have no clue what they are teaching these days. Without the nbsp, wikipedia displays only one of the spaces.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>can you please explain the significance of the brackets in <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/2/e/e2ec1408c32aa89628ad05362a9234e5.png" alt="[\hat s(t)]" /> which I notices in the "Hilbert transform" article? --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKYN_0594.html" title="User:KYN">KYN</a> 22:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for the confusion. I tried putting them in parens (), but then I had parens inside of parens. The brackets just looked better, but I have to admit that it gives the appearance of a deeper meaning. Please fix as you see fit.

<p>Looking over some of your edits, it seems to me your use of <a href="../../../t/e/x/TeX_cfe6.html" title="TeX">TeX</a> is often clumsy: you don't use \, between f(x) and dx; God only knows why you always use the matrix environment for "stacked" fractions \frac{a}{b}; you actually use "stacked" fraction <b>inline</b> rather than in "displayed" TeX, and that's uncouth ... several other problems. Take a look at some of my recent edits of articles you've worked on. Also, are you aware that the title phrase should be bolded at its first appearance in an article (see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style)? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:29, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi Bob,</p>
<p>i'm still at a loss as to why "disambiguating" <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinc_function.html" title="Sinc function">Sinc function</a> helped. now we'll have multiple occurances of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/a/3/0a3b3f91427e51b1fa425712d62004e0.png" alt="\mathrm{sinc}(x) \" /> meaning two different things. i would prefer if it was the normalized sinc all around, but losing that battle, adding the π to get <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/4/e/e4ea0e9298757952e5ac4700afd53791.png" alt="\mathrm{sinc}(\pi x) \" />is better than to have two inconsistent definitions.</p>
<p>also, i am still not clear what the "heuristic" basis for the sampling theorem does for anything. it doesn't prove anything and the explanation relying on that part of the DTFT article is circular. first we have to establish, independently, that sampling a signal causes its spectrum to be repeatedly shifted by multiples of the sampling frequency and overlap added. then, <i>after that</i>, to motivate the definition of the DTFT, you ask "what is the F.T. of that ideally sampled signal?" and the result, with a couple of substitutions <i>x</i>[<i>k</i>] for <i>x</i>(<i>kT</i>) and ω for 2π<i>fT</i>, is the DTFT. but to use that as a mathematical basis for the sampling theorem is circular. it serves no purpose.</p>
<p>lastly, you confuse the terms "aliases" with "images". e.g. an "anti-aliasing filter" is what goes before an A/D converter and an "anti-imaging filter" is what comes after the D/A. those copies of the original baseband spectrum shifted to multiples of the sampling frequency are <i>images</i> not aliases. if the signal is undersampled and a piece of the first image overlaps the baseband spectrum, that overlapping portion are aliases.</p>
<p>sorry to be so terse. i'm tired of typing too much at <a href="../../../l/u/t/User%7ELutzL_5d2b.html" title="User:LutzL">User:LutzL</a>.<a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 05:49, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, you guys have been working overtime. I hope it was worth it. Regarding the multiple defs of sinc(), I think the best that Wikipedia can do is to accurately describe the complexity of the outside world, not just the world of mathematicians or EEs. A textbook writer has the advantage of tunnel vision. But sinc() has two common definitions (and always will in the foreseeable future). And almost everyone who uses it is careful to specify which one they are using. Those who don't are either naive or arrogant. So people are accustomed to seeing sinc defined differently for math articles than for EE articles. They expect it. Unfortunately <u>that</u> is the standard that has evolved, and it is too pervasive for Wikipedia to fix, not to mention that neither side wants to give up their preferred definition. The <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/9/d/a9dd3feade5f32045cce5b183db92d87.png" alt="\rm{sinc}_{\pi}\," /> notation is rarely used and not self-evident; i.e., the casual reader will still have to look for the definition. And of course any given article is still free to locally define and use <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/9/d/a9dd3feade5f32045cce5b183db92d87.png" alt="\rm{sinc}_{\pi}\," />. Another advantage of the disamb page is that some articles mention the sinc() function in a non-specific way; i.e., they don't really care which definition you use. So those articles have the additional option of referencing the disamb page. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_K_df6a.html" title="User:Bob K">Bob K</a> 11:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i agree with you about the uselessness of the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/9/d/a9dd3feade5f32045cce5b183db92d87.png" alt="\rm{sinc}_{\pi}\," /> notation. to me the simplest thing to do is to say <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/9/e/b9e1765191eed151e1c0d692734954f7.png" alt="\rm{sinc}(\pi x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \," /> when that is what you want and to say <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/d/4/7d46b02cbb75be865ea083ea2216824d.png" alt="\rm{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \," /> when that is what is needed. i wrote that thing on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Talk%7ESinc_function_c8a6.html" title="Talk:Sinc function">Talk:Sinc function</a> because i thought it would be nice to change the default notation (forcing those who wanted <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/5/b/d5b2d6c197cb7881b4255791a6156fd6.png" alt="\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \," /> to say <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/2/a/d2ac2d52507e3ab1a1d6e038c3065be7.png" alt="\rm{sinc}(x/ \pi) \," /> but that met with enough resistance that i dropped the idea (since the default <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_Fourier_transform_0aab.html" title="Continuous Fourier transform">continuous Fourier transform</a> is not to my liking either. i just think that using <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/6/8/c6817be45204c80359529d78a3d45740.png" alt="\rm{sinc}(x) \," /> in all cases and then having to explain or reference which sinc() you're using is less concise than having <b>one</b> definition and tossing in a π factor when needed. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 00:55, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said <a href="../../../n/y/q/Talk%7ENyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem_1469.html#Mathematical_basis_of_sampling_and_reconstruction_theorem." title="Talk:Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem">9-May</a>, I do understand your quibble with the DTFT, and I can replace it with the Fourier transform. In fact the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&amp;oldid=44467606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&amp;oldid=44467606" rel="nofollow">19-March version</a>] (before I changed it) actually did that, except that it happened to use the label <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/8/9f82d189c6538bb1d9bb3221c8aa7e4a.png" alt="X_{dtft}(f)\," /> for the transform.

<dd>since the DTFT thing appealed to the PSF, why not use that proof instead?. i <b>really</b> do not like the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/8/9f82d189c6538bb1d9bb3221c8aa7e4a.png" alt="X_{dtft}(f)\," /> notation. it's another notational convention introduced that is neither necessary nor used anywhere else.</dd>

<dd>I was sort of expecting some resistance to the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/8/9f82d189c6538bb1d9bb3221c8aa7e4a.png" alt="X_{dtft}(f)\," /> notation, and it is unnecessary. I will do something about that soon (but not tonight). My reason for not embracing the PSF is that the PSF is not how most newbies get their first glimpse of insight into the sampling theorem. I was trying to make it easy to understand, and therefore fun. I don't care if it not rigorous, and I don't care if it is not labelled "proof". All I hope to do is convince some reluctant reader that sampling really works and that they can understand why and maybe even explain it to their friends. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_K_df6a.html" title="User:Bob K">Bob K</a> 01:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well, that so-called "rigorous proof" was meant to be that for the newbie. it was explicit and could be called "bloated" (i step-by-step evaluate some expressions), but it isn't deep or complicated. it is about the conceptually simplest proof i can think of. most EE textbooks that do it are almost the same except they don't represent the dirac comb as a Fourier series and apply the frequency shifting operation, instead they identify the F.T. of the dirac comb as another dirac comb in the frequency domain and then apply convolution in the frequency domain. i have always considered that to be a bit harder for the newbie to grasp. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 03:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you look past my unfortunate labelling, you will see that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/8/9f82d189c6538bb1d9bb3221c8aa7e4a.png" alt="X_{dtft}(f)\," /> is just what you have described<b>...</b> the convolution of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/4/6/b46824dbe142795dce9550ef2f17e90b.png" alt="X(f)\," /> with "another dirac comb in the frequency domain". So I think your issues are<b>:</b>
<ol>
<li>labelling</li>
<li>Fourier series vs. comb</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I agree to fix the labelling. And as you said, the comb is the method preferred by EE texts. (So I am in good company.) So apparently I have a "proof" afterall. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_K_df6a.html" title="User:Bob K">Bob K</a> 11:14, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also understand your distinction between <b>alias and image</b>, and in certain contexts (such as <i>anti-aliasing filter</i>) I can see that it is useful. But the word <i>aliasing</i> (in the discrete-time sense) is also used more broadly than that, and I did not have to look very far for an example<b>:</b> <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliasing.html#Aliasing" title="Aliasing">Aliasing#Aliasing</a>. Maybe that article should explain the narrower definition as well. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_K_df6a.html" title="User:Bob K">Bob K</a> 01:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
