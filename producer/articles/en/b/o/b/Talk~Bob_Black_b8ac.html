<p>This looks like someone's self-aggrandizement. <a href="../../../-/-/_/User%7E--_April_95d9.html" title="User:-- April">-- April</a></p>
<p>Actually, Bob Black's name is indeed known in underground publishing circles...usually as an egotistic jerk. But his 'Abolition of Work' is somewhat famous. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a></p>
<p>Black is indeed a well-known author and personality in the anarchist milieu. He clearly meets the "more famous than an average college professor" test and is deserving of an article here. The article certainly needs some work - beyond an account of "l'affaire Hogshire", its merely a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a> and the article is not well organized. The Hogshire stuff probably needs a rewrite for NPOV purposes. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter Werner</a> - 2005/06/14.</p>

<p>This is Bob Black. I have only just seen your listing for me; I was unaware of your existence. I suggest some corrections.</p>
<p>You state that I am disliked by many because of the Jim Hogshire affair. But you also correctly say that I have criticised many other anarchists. For many whom I had previously criticized -- like Fred Woodworth and Chaz Bufe -- the Hog business was merely a welcome pretext for revenge. In fact, even those I have criticized long afterwards, such as Bill Brown and Murray Bookchin, then suddenly publicly developed an indignant interest in an ancient scandal they had ignored for years.</p>
<p>I was not attacked by "other publishers" because I have never been a publisher. The publishers who turned on me, Lompanics and Feral House, were Jim Hogshire's publishers in whose self- interest it was to exploit the incident to publicize his books. In the case of Adam Parfrey/Feral House there was also the element of solidarity, since he too is a narcotics addict (heroin, which is reportedly now Hog's drug of choice). His absurd letter never attracted more than about 30 signatories, most of them Loompanics or Feral House employees, prior enemies of mine, drug addicts and my ex girl friend. As Rev. Crowbar of Popular Reality wrote, what's most impressive is who didn't sign.</p>
<p>Since you choose to say more about the Hog affair than about all the rest of my activity, you might at least include links to sites like Spunk.org where you can read some of my side of the afair, in "My Date with Jim Hogshire" and "Letter to Doomed Planet and Pistil Press." For an example of an anarchist publisher -- Green Anarchist [London] -- who extends critical support and an analysis of my critics, see John Connor's letter at the Bob Black pages at www.inspiracy.com, which is also where to find more of my texts in one place than any other. I don't operate it, it belongs to Rodney E. Griffith. I don't recogize the website address you say is "my" website. I've never had my own website.</p>
<p>The Hog afair ended in anticlimax. Hog raised probably thousands of dollars by pledging to go to trial as a test case for his legally ludicrous theory that possession of opium is legal if you made it from legally obtainable ingredients. (There was already case authority to the contrary.) Instead, he copped a plea to a misdemeanor. The money for the trial ended up in his opium teapot. Then it turned out that, with his 15 minutes of fame behind him, Hog was after all nothing more than a junkie. He's burned out. He hasn't written a book in 8 years (I've written 2, and other things). Asking about him from Seattle contacts a few years ago, some said they never heard of him, others that they've heard nothing in years, and one ho repeated a rumor that Hog is now a heroin addict, fulfilling another of my prophecies.</p>
<p>In other matters: I don't consider myself an "anarcho- primitivist." The anthropologist's name is Richard Borshay Lee, not Richard Borshoy Lee. The linkto the Swedish site was new to me -- I'd heard of a Swedish translation of "Abolition of Work" but never saw it. You could also provide links to translations into some other languages, everything from French to Finnish.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I respect your work, but...:"he boasted that he had informed on Hogshire to the police leading to the latter's arrest." Is that really true? I hope not, man. At least not "bragging" about it. We shouldn't associate with the police unless we're throwing tear gas canisters back at them&#160;;) (P.S. i bought your book online the other day, should come in the mail soon) --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 03:40, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respect Black's work too, but it is true. Actually the letter to Seattle PD wasn't anonymous, [<a href="http://www.seesharppress.com" class="external text" title="http://www.seesharppress.com" rel="nofollow">See Sharp Press</a>] (operated by Chaz Bufe) has a scan of the original letter, it is addressed from "Robert C.

<p><i>More corrections added 4 Feb 2005:</i></p>
<p>Never mind the quotes, your short text is seriously inaccurate in many ways, some significant, some not so.</p>
<p>I was never a criminal defense attorney, not when I was young, and not anytime since. Because, like most American lawyers, I am not a litigator. I am unaware that anyone has ever made this claim before you published it, or since.</p>
<p>My former publisher Loompanics did not stage a "book-burning" of my books. Mike Hoy would never do that -- it would destroy his reputation. Rather, he sold off the copies of "The Abolition of Work" until they were gone -- and scrupulously paid me royalties. If you don't believe me, ask him. Again, this is a fairy tale never told before.</p>
<p>I didn't have dinner at Jim Hogshire's house. The weird thing about Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hog is that (because of the dope they were on) they had no appetite, as Hog told me, they didn't eat, except reluctantly, there was no food in their refrigerator. We nibbled on crackers. Again, I've read 10 articles put up or ghost-written by Hog but none of them ever said this. So I think you should take my word for it unless Hog or his EX-wife (all this made her fed up with Hog) contradicts my story. But they will not, because they have both descended into narcotic oblivion. You won't even be able to find them. They may be dead. Whoppie!</p>
<p>I never made a phone call to the Seattle police. Hog, by his own admission, did make a phone call to the Seattle police to bust ME, but that is likely another of his lies, especially considering what the cops might see if they visited his apartment. Still, if true, it means that he snitched on me before I snitched on him. Rather, I went back to Albany, thought hard about it all, and then WROTE TO the Seattle police (who had already heard of him, it turned out). A dirty business but necessary to my honor.</p>
<p>You go wrong in supposing that the hysteria and witch-hunt whipped up, for business reasons, by Hog's publishers Loompanics and Feral House, 9 years ago, still matters. I am more active, more creative, indeed more famous than ever -- just do a Google search on me (and on Hog) and you will be convinced. I am an anarchist of worldwide importance, translated into a dozen languages. Who's ever translated Jim Hogshire? Even most of my political enemies are too embarrassed to bring up the Hog scandal. Bookstores controlled by anarcho-Stalinists, such as Lucy Parsons Center, bring the Hogshit up, but only as a transparent pretext for banning my books because they are revolutionary.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would help if you include my mailing address in your listing in case any of your readers has questions.</p>

<p>I got real tired of each paragraph being a single line high.</p>
<p>This entry on Bob Black does a disservice to the range of Black's writings and influence on contemporary anarchism. It's true that "many anarchists" and "many publishers" dislike Black. There are a few anarchists who are critical of Black, but there is simply no evidence of widespread hostility towards Bob Black.</p>
<p>Black is a provocative writer and thinker. Attempting to use his personal life to discredit his intellectual work is just an example of intellectual laziness. -- Chuck0</p>
<p>Are all anarchists so used to protest that when it comes time to actually do they still just protest? Here we have two prominent representatives of DIY, not Doing It Themselves. Mr Black, if you aren't a primitivist, change it, if they got the anthropologist wrong, change it, etc etc. I could understand not wanting to bother, even respect not giving a damn what others think about it, but that you would write a 6 paragraph essay in the comments section and not make a single change that actually matters is damned weird.</p>
<p>And Rev Chuck, the informing affair was not brought in to 'discredit his intellectual work', it was brought in because this is an article about Mr Black, and while his personal life might be irrelevent to a discussion of his work, it's not out of place in an encyclopaedia article about him. If you feel more is needed on his work, then by all means bring it in. DIY.</p>

<p>Bob Black PO Box 3142 Albany, NY 12203 USA</p>
<p><a name="My_understanding..." id="My_understanding..."></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBob_Black_b8ac.html" title="Edit section: My understanding...">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">My understanding...</span></h2>
<p>My understanding is that Bob Black does not use a computer, or if so, rarely does. Most of his writings being available online have mostly been due to friends posting them or posting his responses. While he may not be a primitivist per se, he does write for Green Anarchy occasionally, and to my understanding has a dim view of technology. If he doesn't correct things on here, its probably because he's not the one actually posting his responses.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder about some of the quotes that have been taken out of context, particuarly the welfare one (he was on welfare at the time, this is true, and he's generally admitted to being poor well, just about all the time...is this supposed to be some personal dig?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the edits here are probably geniunely written by Black. They came from an anonymous IP that belongs to an AOL proxy (and were originally put in the main article, not this talk page) so either he has a computer or is using someone else's. The tone fits his style, echoes things he's written before and doesn't say anything particularly trollish as would be expected from a forgery.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the quotes added anonymously seem like slander. What does it matter to wikipedia if he was/is on welfare? The piece that the quote came from is at least several years old, maybe as much as ten. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 12:48, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh I agree they're genuine. I'm just saying he himself probably didn't type them up. I've seen a number of posts or messages from Bob Black which were basically him writing stuff for other people to type up and post online. He has also posted on Flag (an anarchist discussion forum) a couple times, but evidently has a tendnecy to triple post or not be able to use things on the forum. My understanding, like mentioned above, is he generally steers clear of computers just like Hunter S. Thompson did (who used a typewriter to his death and was known for having a ridiculously hard time using even a fax machine, or what he called The Mojo Wire). Some people just don't care to use or even learn how to use computers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the welfare thing, thats also only a dig if you really view monetary success as crucial. Anyone whose read Bob Black's work (abolition of work anyone?) understands he probably doesn't give a damn. It seems irrelevent to the discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The big issue is that, at the end of the day, Bob Black is lightning rod of controversy most of the time, from within the anarchist community, to the hallowed halls of zinedom. Most, if not all people, declare he probably is a very large asshole. Other people (particuarly the guys at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimethinc.html" title="Crimethinc">Crimethinc</a> and various anrcho-primitivists) seem to like him alot. Other (Murray Bookchin, etc) don't. The endless prattle about it seems to mostly have died down, though occasionally it flares up whenever the split between left and post left anarchy flare up (which has increasingly happened lately).

<p>Bob Black is brilliant!!! "The Abolition of Work" is a Masterpiece!!! I read it years ago and I cherish every word of it.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 00:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I agree. I reprinted it like 12 years ago. It may be that Bob Black face-to-face could be hard to put up with, but I think his writing is decades ahead of the tired crypto-Stalinist crap his detractors are always trying to push. I find he's spot-on with his analysis of the left and is one of the few in "anarchism" who are worth reading. 71.19.38.228 01:24, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Horseshit. It's not slander to mention that they turned around and DID THE EXACT SAME THING. You can read the goddamned article yourself. Don't hit me with "it's probably slander". It's going back in. SiberioS 04:48, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really tire of the useless arguments back and forth about (a)s calling cops. It serves no purpose; most people will have to deal with cops sooner or later as a matter of pure pragmatism. Ideology or being a "good anarchist" has nothing to do with it. But I suppose Wikipedia isn't the place to grind that ax. Keep it in. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 12:38, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a useless argument when considered in context. If Bob Black was a catholic theologian, than yes, it would be irrelevent. But he isn't and the Wooden Shoe isn't a Bible Bookstore. Both make open and avowed claims to their own political affiliation, which is "anarchism", and in the case of the Wooden Shoe (unlike Bob Black who has willfully admitted to and his proclivity to use the legal system before this incident ever happened) has made their opinion known on the issue of using the cops for ANYTHING, particuarly in moments of bodily endangerment. They uniformly condemended Bob Black for "Grassing" and took all his books down. They said it was unacceptable to call the cops after the fact and once out of harms way. Members of the same collective than turned around and did exactly what they criticized Bob Black for. Thats not a "useless" argument, thats a very relevent one. If its useless to other anarchists its because it offends them that someone might actually pointout (a) their rank hypocrisy and/or (b) how little they hold to the very political leanings they confess to believe in.SiberioS

<dd>It seems we more or less agree. I didn't look at the context of your addition closely before I reverted it. My apologies. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 18:42, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>(the following was added to the end of the main article, along with numerous edits which were preserved)</i>:</p>
<p>NOTE TO THE EDITOR (not for publication_:</p>
<p>This is Bob Black. I've made some corrections above, but several matters are so tangled that you will have to decide what to make of it.</p>
<p>The head-slamming incident confuses two incidents. One, at the Gorilla Grotto in San Francisco, involved a certain John Law slamming my head into the sidewalk, the most violent point in a feud with Grotto proprietor Gary Warne, who later became a policeman, then died. I sued Law, not for battery, but for a later libel. After a few months battling his lawyers, I dropped the suit, but it cost him $3,900.</p>
<p>Four years later, after 5 physical attacks on me by Processed World goods, I did a pie hit -- actually, it was yogurt (an in joke -- against PW honcho Chris Carlsson, who proceeded to beat me up, spit in my face, steal $120 from my wallet, and get me arrested. I never sued PW. PW had sued me trying to get an injunction forbidding me to post flyers "mentioning" PW, but the court refused as that is unconstitutional. I was already planning to leave the area and did so in summer 1985. 5 years later the charge was dismissed, presumably because of the statute of limitations, although I haven't researched the point.</p>
<p>I didn't maneuver my way out of Hog's apartment. He completely ignored the fact that I was holding his wife in front of me, and trained the rifle on her. Eventually I gave up, Hog finally got out of my way and I left at 2:00 a.m. Note that Hog was not arrested for conspiracy, he and his wife were arrested on separate charges (it always happens at a drug bust that everybody present is arrested, but charges against her were soon dropped). Hog was not "apprehended," if this means arrested against his will: law enforcement made no attempt to locate and arrest him, contrary to his claim to be a prominent enemy of the state. If he were, the Feds could have prosecuted him without regard to the State's plea deal, not only on drug charges but as an interstate fugitive (a felony).</p>
<p>About Hagen-Brenner, I do not recall any anarchists, or anybody at all, criticizing me. In that case "going to the police" meant calling to have an apparent unexploded or partly exploded bomb removed from my apartment. Maybe somebody did, but I don't remember it.</p>
<p>I deleted the reference to an "exchange" with Bookchin because he has never replied to my criticisms, although he has replied to John Zerzan, David Watson, John C. Clark, etc. -- just as I was conspicuously omitted from the rogues gallery in "Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism" in the first place. Why? He knows I'll just fuck him up even more. Instead, he subsidized a See Sharp Press reprint of a libelous old pamphlet on the Processed World affair.</p>
