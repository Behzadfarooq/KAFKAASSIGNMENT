<p>Hello! Ill just cut to the chase here- please stop removing the unit name from numbers in tables. It make is more difficult on the long lists to see which numbers what and requires re-entering units when c&amp;p'ing. I don't, however, have a problem with seperating them into columns- I think thats fine. Also, please don't use that exact table coding- for example these tables do not need a fixed/locked width, and while the 5-segment system has its merits- its difficult to change that code to get proper looking gridlines. (at least with my knowledge of code). I appreciate your 'grudge' work on all these rather un-exciting units, but I would much prefer conversions, etc. then these kind of formating things. Good luck on your units work! <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyengine5_c699.html" title="User:Greyengine5">Greyengine5</a> 03:16, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again! By 5-segment I just meant leaving out gridlines and just putting a line across every 5 rows on the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">Skyscraper</a> page. That code for that particular case (and for a couple others) also had a fixed/locked with, which wrap lines before there needed to be in many cases. While the tables do <i>look</i> nicer, and cleaning up pages is very noble work, the pages are harder to work with and to read. Looking across is harder without gridlines and requires more double checking to make sure your in the right column. With no units attached to the numbers, they have to be re-added when cut&amp;pasteing and cross checked to make sure the right numbers are witht the right units. Also, when your looking down a column to know what spec is there you have to look across and check more often to see what the category is, whereas when the units are there its much easier. Once again, <i>please</i> stop changing the tables in this way as it creates difficulty with these tables. I do fully appreciate your work on units (being time consuming, etc.)- just not quite in this form. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyengine5_c699.html" title="User:Greyengine5">Greyengine5</a> 04:21, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh I didn't mean to restrict yourself to unit conversions. It was just the practice of stripping units off numbers on those tables. For most tables the 5-segments system is probably just as good as full gridlines so thats not such big deal. On some of those pages (the longer lists)I added an alternating gray/white backround, as a alternative to gridlnes. I can understand gridlines, which, while handy, can be a mixed bag in how the table looks. Also, I dont have a problem with seperating the data into seperate columns like you'v done. The code thing is minor as thats easy to remove- not being an expert on code either-I think its was ' width=40% ' or something like that. So just to re-hash, the main thing was the units/numbers issue and more rather then less gridlines (which the best number for is always bit subjective anyway). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyengine5_c699.html" title="User:Greyengine5">Greyengine5</a> 17:24, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bobblewick- may I ask why you are removing visible user instruction messages from pages like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_musicians_in_the_first_wave_of_punk_music.html" title="List of musicians in the first wave of punk music">List of musicians in the first wave of punk music</a> etc? As a person who spent lots of time and sore fingers alphabeticising some of these otherwise totally randomly ordered lists I think it's better that editors are reminded to insert their new contributions in the correct place rather than just stuck on the end of what is already there. Maybe there is a policy on this now that I missed (I used to be very active but only dip in now and again these days), but I'll post this message to village pump as well in case anyone else wants to discuss <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 19:29, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Both the "metre" and "meter" spelling of the units, and "litre" and "liter", and their multiples and subdivisions, are acceptable spellings. You can change them to make usage within an article consistent; changing them just for the sake of change is likely to piss people off.</p>
<ul>
<li>The corollary is that if you add something in which the existing spelling is consistent, follow that spelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>This of course applies to many other spelling variants, such as "honor" or "honour", "carcass" or "carcase", etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Thanks for pointing that out. I usually resist the temptation. In the case of a specific article on units, I thought that the 're' spelling was accepted, but perhaps not. As you suggest, it is better to avoid holy wars on spelling. It does not worry me too much. Perhaps I should have left it unchanged. Mea culpa.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Same goes for the symbols "l" and "L"—see <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litre.html" title="Litre">litre</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:36, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. I know about the two options of 'l'/'L' symbols.</dd>

<p>Incidentally, I was interested in your suggestion that wing loading should be in force units. I had never thought of it like that and it makes some sense. I see that you have reverted some of your changes but it was interesting to question it. In any case, I think that it is redundant for aircraft articles to state a measure that is merely the ratio of two other measures already stated. Most readers don't care, and those that do care can calculate the ratio from the information provided. Wing loading and power to weight ratio are examples in that category. My main concern was to see SI units rather than 'kgf'.

<p>I calculated it off google. I wouldn't let anyone give you trouble on how they are ordered, as most native english speakers use english units anyway -its just a matter of catering to the majority.

<p>Hi Bobblewik,</p>
<p>I've noticed that you have spent a considerable amount of time placing spaces between numbers and units of measurements on many pages to do with sport and now I have read the section relating to this <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a> I see that a space is not the correct way around this but in fact a non-breaking space should be used as in 25&#160;lb and not 25 lb or 25lb. Just thought if you were going to continue with doing this it might be an idea to stick to the Manual of Style otherwise the use of a space is as incorrect as no space.<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScraggy4_3045.html" title="User:Scraggy4">Scraggy4</a> 21:02, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip, I didn't know that the manual of style said that. It is a lot more effort but I might try it sometime.<br />

<dd>I added the recommendation. It means that (a) an awkward line wrap can't separate a number from its unit; and (b) you can put units in tables without the risk that the units will wrap when the table is squashed. For example, the tables at <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">Skyscraper</a> looked very bad before I inserted a bunch of &amp;nbsp; just now. However, it's just a recommendation: use an ordinary space if its convenient. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 00:40, 2004 Jul 23 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again Bobblewik - I've recently had a question in relation to WP Aircraft about spaces before imperial units. I've taken a look at the Wikipedia conventions, which suggest a space (ie, "25 ft" over "25ft"). Do you know of a standard <i>outside</i> Wikipedia that spells this convention out? Just taking care to cross the t's and dot the i's... --<a href="../../../r/l/a/User%7ERlandmann_a23c.html" title="User:Rlandmann">Rlandmann</a> 13:33, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ISO 31-0 and the UK equivalent BS 5775 apparently recommend a space before the unit, but I have not seen the original text of either. I also find the recommendation in:</dd>

<dd>The scope of the references certainly includes metric units. Whether the authors would recommend the same format for non-metric units is unclear to me. It may be implicit in the IEE reference and the unseen ISO and BS references. I would be surprised if any respectable author/editor would specifically want all copy to have spaces before metric units but not before imperial units. However, to answer your specific question, I am not aware that the recommendation for a space includes imperial units.<br /></dd>

<p>I'm really happy that you're inserting metric units into so many articles! One suggestion, though: Can you use the &amp;nbsp; before your units like the style manual suggests? It really does look nicer. Thanks again! --<a href="../../../s/f/o/User%7ESfoskett_16b5.html" title="User:Sfoskett">SFoskett</a> 20:51, Sep 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for adding the spaces to the Jaguar engine articles, but can you please use non-breaking spaces instead? That is the standard, and it makes the articles look much better.

<dd>I agree that they should be there. They are on my list of 'good things' that should be universal on Wikipedia. I remember our previous discussion in September. I admit to being reticent about non-breaking spaces being on my extensive list of things that I do, but I support your campaign for them. My reticence is partly because some people are hostile to metric units and I sometimes want to keep the changes minimal to reduce the chances of my whole edit being reverted. I sometimes put a remark in the comment field if I add spaces, I will try to do this more often so that you can examine my edit history. I am sure that you do as I do, and search for terms like '35mm' and '7.62mm' in need of spaces. If you don't, then perhaps you might like to try. In any case, keep up the good work. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 19:15, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no general rule that you need to keep a measurement from breaking at the end of the line between the number and the unit of measure. There are times when it is desirable to put in that nbsp, but the considerations then are the same for English units as they are for metric units.</p>
<p>Some further thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't follow any hard and fast rules, it's mostly common sense.</li>
<li>You might want to do it, for example, when talking about a "3&#160;A fuse"; it won't result in any ugly gap at the end of the line.</li>
<li>You might want to do it if the measurement is at the end of a paragraph; if the line is going to break anyway, it might as well include the number too.</li>
<li>You might want to do it in tables which include dual measurements in two different systems of units, to force any break between the two different systems rather than within one of them</li>
<li>It is important to use it to keep from having breaks within the number, as when numbers are written in the 1&#160;234&#160;567.89 kg format (Wikipedia Style Guide says use commas in these numbers, however).</li>
<li>It is important to keep from having breaks within the components of the unit of measure, e.g. 234 W&#160;m<sup>-1</sup>&#160;K<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
<li>It is much preferred to allow a break between the number and the symbol than either of the last two cases.<br /></li>

<dd>It used to be the case that I did not use nbsp. My priority has always been to get the metric units there. It is a <i>nice to have</i> if the break is not between the number and the symbol. However, I got so many requests for nbsp from people that I decided to use it, even though it requires more effort. This was on the basis that some of those people would support metric values if done in that way. That extra effort is certainly something I can give up quite happily.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your thoughts are illuminating. I had not thought about it in that detail but what you say makes sense to me. Now that you have brought it to my attention, I may modify the way that I use nbsp.

<dd>I don't know why, but my browser is breaking the above 234 W&#160;m<sup>-1</sup>&#160;K<sup>-1</sup> after the W when I few this. Strange! Okay, I maybe figured it out; it just did that when I was viewing the "differences" page, not when I view it normally.</dd>

<dd>But in any case, it did remind me of something else; using &amp;minus; will keep it from splitting between the negative sign and the number, which may not matter in the case of these superscripts but is a good thing to keep in mind with negative temperatures, for example.

<dd>Yes I know that html does not show double spaces. With html pages, I sometimes paste the text into a word processor and run a spell checker. Eliminating double spaces is something that I do without thinking. It is a carry-over from checking non-html copy. I do it by global search and replace so it doesn't take much effort.

<p>Hi Bobblewik, i just noticed your changes to the athletics pages re: 1500m vs 1500 m. Excellent changes, I find this typo a lot too and try and fix it when I can. I have a nother issue too. I have a tendancy not to use a comma for a four unit number i.e. 1500 m or 5000 m races. For longer races I have a preference to use a space, i.e 10 000 m not 10,000 m. What is the convention with regard to the use of a comma? <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 20:18, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the space is mentioned in a standard as an internationally accepted thousand separator but I can't recall where. The problem with the comma is that it is regional, some regions use the period for thousands and the comma for decimals. I am also quite happy with your preference for 4 digits without comma. However, I have plenty of people complaining about the addion of metric units and I don't want to adopt style conventions that might give people more reason to be hostile to my changes. What you say makes sense to me and I support you if you want to raise it for discussion or make edits to articles in the way you describe.

This is really bizarre since the original distances were measured and published in metric. The author must have converted them all to imperial and then cut out the metric version.

<p>Hi Bobblewik. I noticed you removed several hyphens from <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_777.html" title="Boeing 777">Boeing 777</a>. I was not able to find official Wiki Style advice on hyphenation of compound adjectives, but <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compound_noun%2C_adjective_and_verb.html#Hyphenated_compound_adjectives" title="Compound noun, adjective and verb">Compound noun, adjective and verb#Hyphenated compound adjectives</a> covers it pretty well. For example, I think "large-scale," as an adjective, should be hyphenated. A quick Google query finds that usage dominates in Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22large+scale%22+site%3Aen.wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22large+scale%22+site%3Aen.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I have also noticed that a lot of engineering print media consistently hyphenates number+unit combos when used as adjectives, e.g. "two 75,000-lb. Rolls Royce Trent 875s." Maybe there are examples to the contrary? —<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleminra_45b2.html" title="User:Fleminra">Fleminra</a> 01:07, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not an automated process. It is all done by hand. The priority was the unit changes. Whilst I was there I did some changes that are of secondary importance to me such as removing low added value links such as years and replacing '-' with 'to'. If you disagree with these changes of secondary importance, feel free to revert them and leave it with the unit changes. I can discuss my reasoning about these secondary changes with you if you like but perhaps it would be better in a more generic place such as the manual of style talk pages (where misunderstanding about date links are discussed frequently).

<p>Aloha. A few times I've run across your conversions of units of measure, and have been finding it helpful. The one thing that sticks out, though, is when you use the abbreviation for pound (lb). When using it in the plural (e.g. 155 pounds) it's supposed to have the "s" at the end (155 lb<b>s</b>). Typically you've been leaving this off, but on the page <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora_Snow_47bb.html" title="Aurora Snow">Aurora Snow</a> you removed an "s" that was already there. I've added it in the few cases I've seen. Please keep this in mind, and continue the good work! <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahasrahla_5227.html" title="User:Sahasrahla">Sahasrahla</a> 20:17, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This topic occasionally crops up. I am not aware of any references that say units of measurement should be suffixed with an 's' in the plural. There are a few that say they should not, including the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a>: <i>yd for yard (not yds), mi for mile, lb for pound (not lbs)</i>. If we do it for lb, we would need to do it for kg to be consistent. It is common to see 'lbs' but it is by no means the default. However, I do appreciate you discussing it with me. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 20:42, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the best of my knowlege, the rule is inconsistent. In metric, the unit abbreviations are the same for singular and plural, and the same is true for most common Imperial units, with the exception of the pound -- possibly because the abbreviation for the pound was borrowed from the French, while the full name is English. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 21:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Bobblewick. There are some style guides which tolerate either. The ones which only accept one almost universally insist on lb (including the Wikipedia Manual of Style and the U.S. GPO Style Manual 2000). I can't think of any which insist on adding an s in the plural. English borrowed the symbol from Latin, not from the French <i>livre</i> (which might have used the Latin symbol as well--and in Latin there is no s in the plural. Another problem with "lbs" is that the people who use is are indiscriminate, using it for the <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound-force.html" title="Pound-force">pound-force</a> as well as the mass unit, and thus not properly distinguishing lbf (you don't see lbfs, and maybe rarely lbsf which is more likely to be somebody's usage for pounds per square foot). <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 21:55, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You added several metric equivalents to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. I removed one: where the Strip is described as a "four and a half mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard", you added "(800 m)". Now, I'm no metrics maven, but I've walked up and down the Strip a fair amount, and it's longer than 800 m. I would've just changed it myself but I don't know what conventions you and others follow about rounding (since the "four and a half mile" figure is obviously somewhat inexact, how many significant digits should the metric equivalent use?). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:48, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for spotting the error, James. And thanks for suggesting a number of significant digits, Carnido. I scanned the text and saw "a half mile stretch" and converted that. There is only one significant digit in 0.5 miles so I put 800 m. If I had read the text correctly, I would have read "four and a half miles" as "4.5 miles". Thus I would convert it to '7.2 km'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, metrication is part science and part art. Matching significant digits is a useful guide, but it is not the only one. As Carnido suggests, the "half mile" may suggest a granularity of 0.5 miles. The measured value might be in the range of 4.25 to 4.75 miles (6.8 to 7.6 km). The metric writer might simply say that the Strip is '7 km' long.</dd>

<p>I notice that you've been altering things like General Specifications in the USS <i>Eisenhower</i> article to General specifications instead. Please stop doing that. They are headings, ie titles.

<p>I understand why you are editing the names of Templates to have the first word in uppercase and subsequent words in the Template name in lower case. .....But why are you editing the text inside the Template using the same rule. ie A proper noun such as <b>Windsurfer Boards</b> is not correct if changed to <b>Windsurfer boards</b> (ie Which <b>Windsurfer</b> do you want the reader to <b>board</b>?!).

<dd>Hmm. You are correct to suggest that I am applying the same rule to both i.e. 'lower case initial letters for common nouns'. The term 'windsurfer board' is used to denote a class of objects (common noun), such as 'saloon car' or 'username' rather than a particular object (proper noun) such as 'Ford Focus' or 'Boatman'. If 'Windsurfer Board' is a brand name, then it would indeed be a proper noun.

I am following long-standing practice in the Ships wikiproject in the capitalisation of the table. It could be argued that the changes to the table I have made to include the Propulsion and power, Sensors and processing systems and Electronic warfare and decoys rows is inconsistent in that respect. I think it would probably be a good idea to say about those on the Wikiproject talk page to see what people think about the capitalisation issue.</p>
<p>However, you are again engaged in your incorrect alteration of titles which should have capital letters on all but minor words to only a capital letter on the first word and lower case on the rest. As I have said before, that is incorrect in normal English usage, and so it should not be in the policy of the Wikipedia. I did look over the archives of how that recommendation came into being and it does seem to be the arbitrary decision of a couple of users who appear not to know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>I do not have a right to demand that you stop editing the table in this fashion. However I would ask that you stop doing it please.</p>
<p>That said, I greatly appreciate your efforts to update the templates for ships I have created using only imperial values with the appropriate metric values. That is a very valuable service that you provide for the Wikipedia which is under-rated. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 16:43, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am aware of the style that you prefer and I did not notice that we were reverting each other. I also appreciate your work and do not want to get into a style war with you of all people. Perhaps we should debate this in the Manual of Style and I hope that we can both learn a bit more from each other about the merits of each style. The Manual of Style supports my style but, as you suggest, some of the recommendations can be arbitrary. My current priority is improving the use of units. I frequently make non-unit edits but they are usually of secondary priority.</dd>

<dd>In the interest of cooperation, I will do as you ask. So feel free to implement your own preference and/or undo any changes that I have made to capitals in ship articles.

<p>The bot has moved around some articles that had Quidditch capitalized, I don't really understand why, as I think it was fine to have Quidditch capitalized.

<dd>That was no bot, it was me. I checked: the Wikipedia Manual of Style; the use of capitals in other articles; the use of capitals in game articles. I concluded that 'quidditch' is not supposed to have capitals.

<p>When you altered the document, you broke many links. Wikipedia links are case-sensitive, after all. You also did not consistently alter the links with the word "prehistory" in them.</p>
<p>If you <i>really</i> feel you need to alter the sentence structure, alter it like this: ((StarCraft Secret Missions|StarCraft secret missions)). Otherwise you'll just break the links again.</p>
<p>All of the templates I have seen use lots of capitals, however, so it's probably best if the template is left alone. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimera757_0968.html" title="User:Kimera757">Kimera757</a> 16:30, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct in assuming that I went by the lower case 'b'. I know that 'MB' should mean megabyte. Where people put 'Mb' to mean megabit, I have been changing it explicitly to 'Mbit'.

<dd>It is my opinion that this is a useful and appropriate technique is the disambiguation of many units of measure, and in other cases as well. Just take a stab at what might be correct. Once the existence of the ambiguity has been pointed out, those who know the details can sort it out, and will be quite likely to correct you if you have guessed wrong. Without pointing it out, however, the ambiguity may linger for a long time. Just a little philosophosizing on my part. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:00, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

People should consider the number of links per article/screen and the value of links to the reader. Linking every instance of a possible link seems too mechanistic.

Previously, in the entry for Guy Bono on that page, one could just click the obvious link to "PES". Now, one might think that "PES" is not linked at all (although "ALDE" on the line immediately above is linked). Or, if one knows how the article has been damaged, then one can scroll around searching for a link to "PES", but how many users will know to do that, and of them, how many will like it? The same applies to almost all the articles that contain tables in which the cells are links. —<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarrett_905e.html" title="User:AlanBarrett">AlanBarrett</a> 21:39, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your feedback. Please assume good intent. I think the articles are better without repeated links, otherwise I would not have edited them. If you think that repeating links once per screen is reasonable, then I can understand that. It would mean that the 814 links to LINEAR in the asteroid article would be 25. The Manual of Style has a generous guideline of 10% links per article. My edits brought the percentage down in the article you mention from 59% to 51%. It is still overlinked. If you are unhappy with what I did, just go ahead and revert them. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 23:05, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In ordinary paragraphs of text, 10% links seems like a reasonable limit. In tables, such as those in the asteroid articles and the politicians article I mentioned before, I think it's useful for every cell to be linked. I think the difference is in how the article is used: paragraphs are usually read from beginning to end, so linking a term more than once in a paragraph is pointless (the reader will already have seen the first link by the time they get to the second link); but tables are often searched to find a particular entry of interest, and the reader might easily ignore everything outside the one entry of interest, so it's useful if the entry of interest has links for all the useful terms. —<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarrett_905e.html" title="User:AlanBarrett">AlanBarrett</a> 19:50, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're quite right about the text of an article - multiple links are unnecessary. But in things like the info boxes and engine lists, I feel that they are called-for. For example, a reader might just scan the text and jump to the info box to see which engines were used in a third-generation Honda Civic. They would want to click directly on the engine link, not scan up to see where it was linked.

<p>I've for long been pretty suspicious against the habit of some wikipedians to change references in order to avoid re-directs.</p>
<p>My impression is that a few disadvantages arise from this habit:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no information on the referred page on the connection between the initial referred term and the article one has arrived at.</li>
<li>When (if) a redirect is made into an article (like <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonians.html" title="Estonians">Estonians</a> that for long was nothing but a redirect to <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>), the original references (intended to be to Estonians) will continue to point to the broader term (i.e. at Estonia) if someone has circumvented the redirect with a pipe, which will be hard to find except with the help of a script that checks all pages referring to the broader term.</li>
<li>If the reason for the redirect is an alternative spelling, the result too often will be that the article is changed <b>only</b> at the reference and not systematically, which lead to strange effects and suffering uniformity with regard to capitalization and/or language variety.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are advantages too — technical, I guess. But I would urge you to consider these aspects when you insert <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Redirect_pages_fd15.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages">Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages</a> additions.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
Thanks for your feedback. It took me a while to find your page from just your name. If you sign your comments with 4 tildes (~), then Wikipedia puts a link that I can use directly.</p>
<p>At your request, in the Swiss references to area, I am now leaving the orders of magnitude untouched. You may have already noticed this.</p>
<p>As far as rounding is concerned:<br />
I round to the nearest km² partly because I think it is usually enough for the reader but also for the appeal of integer values. I get the impression that you think more precision is appropriate. I can understand that, particularly where the area is small. In another application, I used a default precision of 1 km² but increased precision to 0.1 km² for all values less than 5 km². My main concern is that area is described in m² or km² rather than hectares. The precision is of secondary importance to me.</p>
<p>So if you are happy with area being described in m² or km², then I will be happy to take your guidance on precision (e.g. including leaving precision at 0.01 km²). Leave a reply on my talk page.<br />

<dd>The text contains the unit 'acre' and I wanted to add metric values. Unfortunately I could not understand the meaning of:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>In 1799, thin-chaffed wheats were seriously injured; and instances were not wanting to show, that an acre of them, with respect to value, exceeded an acre of thick-chaffed wheat, quantity and quality considered, not less than fifty per cent.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It was not just that one sentence, the article contains quite a bit of text like that. As is so often the case, the fault lies with text taken from Household Cyclopedia of 1881. Perhaps I should have mentioned that. I will add a comment to state my reason. If you can understand what that text means, feel free to revise it into plain english. I could not understand it at all.</p>

<p>I could not put it in good english. but I think that in 1799, thin-chaffed wheat were damaged to such a point their yield and quality was about 50% only of thick-chaffed wheat. 50% of yield is easy enough to measure. Quality is less easily measurable though in terms of percentage. I think this is just a ponctual event, and has no interest whatsoever in the long term. So, should be discarded.</p>
<p>What is bugging me is not so much the amount of articles with tags, that the fact it is so proeminently adverstised to the reader. Our kitchen and our administration should not interfere with our final product.

<p>Nod. But I wonder if a solution might not to improve the current text displayed on the page. Perhaps by having it shorter, smaller and at least at the end of article&#160;? Perhaps the best is only to add the category "clean up" and nothing else&#160;? (so a list of articles to improve is still visible &#160;?)
