<p>The majority of people I know who have an informed opinion about income tax would rightly challenge your presumed authority to use Wikipedia as a cyberspace soapbox for your views about the Federal Income tax. What makes your views correct and others' views incorrect? Shall I post the erudite and rational arguments of Bob Schulz (<a href="http://givemeliberty.org" class="external free" title="http://givemeliberty.org" rel="nofollow">http://givemeliberty.org</a>) to Wikipedia and let YOU rebut them?</p>
<p>You might find it interesting that NOBODY in the Federal Government has rebutted either Conces or Schulz's request for admissions - letters that pose their assertions in a confirm/deny style. What does that tell you about government honesty? The DOJ says they answer the questions with prosecutions. Why? Because they operate in utterly corrupt courts where defendants have no possibility of a fair trial. As I have pointed out, the Robert Lawrence case shows a clear example of how the defendant had to use a timing trick to win, and for that the DOJ moved for dismissal with prejudice, not because of the lie of a recalculated difference in the tax owed, but because the DOJ did not have time to corrupt the court before the end of the speedy trial window. How do they corrupt the court? By intimidating the judge, conspiring with him to prevent the entry of defense evidence, packing their ringers in the jury, and preventing the jury from hearing defense evidence.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the government cannot cite a law that makes the average citizen subject to or liable for an income tax, and the government routinely enters lies into the master files and other systems of records to make it seem like a person has taxpayer status when the person owes nothing. Since the Constitution prohibits a direct tax against the people, 26 USC does identify numerous taxable activities, but the typical IRS victim does not engage in any of those activities. Thus, the W-2 and 1099 constitute false and fraudulent reports of taxable income that do not and cannot refer accurately to the respective IRS victims. IRS agents know this, but file Substite Returns anyway.</p>
<p>I don't make this stuff up. I have witnessed the master files for many people who battle against the planet's biggest criminal racketeering organization (the IRS) which the planet's biggest law firm (the DOJ) supports. The unfairness of the contest between citizen and government eclipses that of the contest between David and Goliath.</p>
<p>And you seem unable to do anything but apologize for the criminals in government who illegally and directly impose the income tax upon people who don't owe it.</p>

<p>Famspear, you seem reluctant to make yourself available for correspondence, while rushing too quickly to judgment.</p>
<p>I posted the text from Charles Conces' Report on Income Tax Liability which proves wrong the comments on <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax_in_the_United_States_52c5.html" title="Income tax in the United States">Income tax in the United States</a>, particularly those regarding the meaning of the 16th amendment. I figured since the author lied about that, the public deserved to know the truth. I'll post specific rebuttal on that link at the appropriate place, and make a new page for the report.</p>
<p>Conces makes his information publicy available without copyright notice, so it is freely postable elsewhere, and it should be on Wikipedia. For more information see:</p>

<p>I encourage you to work a little more diligently to provide accurate information about the onerous and unconstitutional implementation of income tax as a sledge hammer on the heads of innocent Americans who don't owe it, but whom the IRS chases down and abuses like some kind of modern Gestapo, helped in no small measure by attorneys like you. The above article on <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_Tax_in_the_United_States_b9c9.html" title="Income Tax in the United States">Income Tax in the United States</a> shows lack of neutrality by claiming the 16th amendment removed the restriction of apportionment. In fact it did not repeal the apportionment requirements of direct taxation, but rather put income tax into the category of an excise.</p>
<p>You lied above when you said Conces' proofs were not verifiable. The text provided an abundance of Supreme Court rulings to prove its assertions.</p>

<dd>Dear BobHurt: I'm not sure what you mean by the statement that I "seem reluctant" to make myself "available for correspondence." Please do not engage in name calling or personal attacks, such as calling me a "coward." You may want to read the Wikipedia rules and guidelines on personal attacks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are now admitting that you posted the Charles Conces report material. Posting this material in Wikipedia violates Wikipedia rules regarding original research, verifiability, and neutral point of view. Also, there are no "lies" (that I know of) in the article on <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax_in_the_United_States_52c5.html" title="Income tax in the United States">Income tax in the United States</a>, and you have identified none.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your statement that I lied when I said Conces' proofs were not verifiable is incorrect. The text did not provide any Supreme Court rulings that prove the assertions. In fact, the phony nature of these kinds of postings has been repeatedly exposed right here on the pages of Wikipedia. These postings are <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester.html" title="Tax protester">tax protester</a> rhetoric, and represent the kind of arguments the courts have uniformly ruled to be not only without legal merit, but also legally frivolous.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your encouragement to me to "work a little more diligently" -- more diligently than what? I am certainly working diligently to edit Wikipedia and to see that may edits -- and those of others -- <b>follow the rules of Wikipedia</b>.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I argue that your additions to Wikipedia are intended to pursuade Wikipedia readers about what you call the "onerous nature of the current implementation of income tax as a sledge hammer on the heads of innocent Americans who don't owe it." You refer to the IRS as an agency that is chasing down and abusing people, and you are comparing the IRS to "some kind of modern Gestapo." Your rhetoric speaks for itself. Wikipedia is not the proper place to try to persuade other people that the IRS is abusing Americans (though certain IRS employees have of course been caught doing that very thing). The Federal income tax at least arguably is onerous, etc. Wikipedia, however, is not the proper place to do what you are trying to do. Wikipedia is not properly used as a cyberspace soapbox for people on a mission to "expose" what they see as IRS abuses.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I do not represent the Internal Revenue Service. "Attorneys like me" (to paraphrase the words of your <i>ad hominem</i> attack on me ) and CPAs and other tax professionals represent <b>American taxpayers</b> in dealings with the IRS -- and I suspect that <b>attorneys like me</b>, etc., do more in one typical month to help Americans with real tax problems with the IRS than you will ever hope to do by posting the false information you have posted in Wikipedia.</dd>

Dear BobHurt: I should also mention another thing. You may not have been aware that "Charles F. Conces" has had his own legal problems with respect to Federal income taxes. In the interest of full disclosure, the following is the text of a news release from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), dated April 25, 2006, and found at the web site for the Department of Justice:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>COURT ORDERS MICHIGAN MAN TO HALT TAX-FRAUD SCHEME AND STOP PREPARING TAX RETURNS FOR OTHERS</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Justice Department announced today that a federal court in Grand Rapids has permanently barred Charles Conces of Battle Creek, Mich., from preparing federal tax returns for others and promoting several tax-fraud schemes. The civil injunction order, signed by Judge Gordon J. Quist of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, was entered against Conces and his organization, the National Lawman Committee for the Public Interest.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The court concluded that Conces “promotes tax evasion by creating and selling materials designed to obstruct the administration of the income tax laws.” The court also noted that Conces promotes the use of the so-called “zero return,” described by the court as “a return showing that the taxpayer has no income based upon the faulty premise that income is not taxable under the income tax laws.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to halting sales of his materials, Conces must also notify his customers of the injunction and give the Justice Department a list of his customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and Social Security numbers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Justice Department has obtained injunctions against more than 175 tax-fraud promoters and tax preparers since 2001. More information about the Justice Department’s efforts against tax-scam promoters can be found at <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/taxpress2006.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/taxpress2006.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/taxpress2006.htm</a>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's the end of the Justice Department news release.</p>
<p>One of the rules or guidelines in Wikipedia is that Wikipedia editors assume good faith on the part of other editors, at least until that good faith is no longer deserved. Although the "Charles F. Conces" mentioned in this news release appears to be the same "Charles Conces" upon whom you are placing your reliance, I assume that you were unaware of Mr. Conces' legal problems -- especially regarding tax fraud schemes; otherwise you would have disclosed them. Whether Conces is guilty or not is not for me to say, but we need to disclose relevant legal problems he is having if we're going ask readers of Wikipedia to rely on Mr. Conces (who apparently is neither a lawyer nor a CPA) as an accurate, non-fraudulent source of tax "law." (I respectfully submit to you the proposition that under the rule of Wikipedia, Mr. Conces probably is not going to be acceptable for this purpose.)</p>
<p>I also assume, from your erroneous interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment (in your comments above regarding apportionment) that you have not actually studied the actual texts of the court decisions and other materials cited by Mr. Conces, etc.</p>
<p>One of the basic concepts in Wikipedia is that you do not have to be an expert in a particular field to edit in that field. In tax law, you do not have to be a tax lawyer or a CPA, for example, to make edits. However, <b>you are held to the same knowledge standards as the experts</b>. You cannot simply copy and paste someone else's commentary or "research" about cases and statutes. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Generally, before a lawyer cites to a particular court decision, he or she analyzes the actual text of the court decision itself -- the actual, full, verbatim text, and not someone else's phony "summary." One of the problems we have had here in Wikipedia consists of repeated attempts by tax protesters to dump false quotations from cases, quotations taken out of context, false statements that a particular court in a particular case essentially ruled one way where the court actually ruled the opposite, etc. The Conces materials contain several instances of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Please read the actual, verbatim texts of any materials you cite, and do not copy and paste original "research" from other internet web sites. Please also be advised that if you are going to <b>set yourself up as have equal or better knowledge of the tax law than tax lawyers and CPAs</b>, you are going to be held to the <b>same standards of knowledge and research</b> as tax lawyers and CPAs. That means you are going to be "called down" on errors you make which you, as a non-lawyer, non-CPA, cannot even be aware of, due to your lack of expertise.</p>
<p>I see that you were in the submarine service. Thanks for your service. One of my best friends also served. I will not presume to lecture you on the inner workings of a submarine. You, however, are free to lecture me (here in Wikipedia) on the intricacies of the tax law; if you do, however, you are going to be held to the standard of knowledge of a legal expert (not just a tax law expert), and you will be expected to know everything that a legal expert knows.

<p>You are right that I am a new user, and I shall do my best to abide by your suggestions. I believe private correspondence would make more sense than this public venue for our exchange. After all Wikipedia is not a chat room (or is it?).</p>
<p>The subject entry says this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Passage of the Sixteenth Amendment</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In response, Congress proposed the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_c0e8.html" title="Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Sixteenth Amendment</a> (ratified by the requisite number of states in 1913), which states:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> held in <i><a href="../../../b/r/u/Brushaber_v._Union_Pacific_Railroad_0443.html" title="Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad">Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad</a>,</i> <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=240&amp;page=1" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=240&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">240 U.S. 1</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>)</span>, the amendment did not expand the federal government's existing taxing power but rather <b>removed any requirement for apportionment of income taxes</b> (meaning tax on profit or gain from any source) among the states on the basis of population (i.e., regardless of whether the tax was deemed direct or indirect).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above contention (that the 16th amendment removed any requirement for apportionment) is false, as proven by the very same U.S. Supreme Court ruling the article cited.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“… <i>the contentions under it (the 16th Amendment), if acceded to, would cause one provision of the Constitution to destroy another</i>; that is, they would result in <i>bringing the provisions of the Amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment into irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned</i>. … This result, instead of simplifying the situation and making clear the limitations on the taxing power … would create radical and destructive changes in our constitutional system and multiply confusion.” <i>BRUSHABER v UNION PACIFIC R. CO., 240 US 1, 12 (1916)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So you see, had the article contended correctly, then the 16th amendment would have exempted the income tax, imposed as a direct tax, from apportionment, but the Court clearly said it does not exempt direct tax (income or otherwise) from apportionment. It merely forces income tax into the class of excises. Thus, the 16th amendment actually does not repeal the apportionment requirement for direct income tax, and it does not repeal the firm denial of Congress' power to tax the people directly:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included in this union, according to their respective Numbers…” <i>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, sec. 2</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; " <i>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, sec. 8, clause 1</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.” <i>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, sec. 9</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court corroborated this interpretation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Nothing can be clearer than that what the constitution intended to guard against was the exercise by the general government of the power of directly taxing persons and property within any state through a majority made up from the other states.” <i>Pollock vs. Farmers’ Loan and Trust Co., 157 US 429, 582 (1895).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The article failed to point out that the Constitution prohibits Congress from directly taxing people, their labor, or their property because of the historical abuse the founders had suffered from tax agents of King George. That's the Constitution gave Congress the power to tax only the states directly. All of this was based on recognition of the inherent wrongness of the government hindering pursuit of happiness through abusive direct tax agents like the IRS.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The patrimony of the poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his own hands, and to hinder his employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper, without injury to his neighbor, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman and of those who might be disposed to employ him.” <i>Butcher's Union Co. v. Cresent City Co., 111 US 746, 757 (1884).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“The court held it unconstitutional, saying: 'The right to follow any lawful vocation and to make contracts is as completely within the protection of the Constitution as the right to hold property free from unwarranted seizure, or the liberty to go when and where one will. One of the ways of obtaining property is by contract. The right, therefore, to contract cannot be infringed by the legislature without violating the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Every citizen is protected in his right to work where and for whom he will. He may select not only his employer, but also his associates.” <i>COPPAGE v. STATE OF KANSAS, 236 U.S. 1, 23 -24 (1915).</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>“That the right to conduct a lawful business, and thereby acquire pecuniary profits, is property, is indisputable.” <i>TRUAX v. CORRIGAN, 257 U.S. 312, 348 (1921).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“… using of anything whereby any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty they had before or hindered in their lawful trade,' All grants of this kind are void at common law, because they destroy the freedom of trade, discourage labor and industry, restrain persons from getting an honest livelihood, and put it in the power of the grantees to enhance the price of commodities. They are void because they interfere with the liberty of the individual to pursue a lawful trade or employment.” <i>Butcher's Union Co. v. Cresent City Co., 111 US 746, 756 (1884).</i></dd>

<dd>“A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the Federal Constitution.” <i>MURDOCK v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, 319 US 105, at 113; 63 S Ct at 875; 87 L Ed at 1298 (1943).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Thus, in the matter of taxation, the constitution recognizes the two great classes of direct and indirect taxes, and lays down two rules by which their imposition must be governed, namely, the rule of apportionment as to direct taxes, and the rule of uniformity as to duties, imposts, and excises.” <i>Pollock, 157 US 429, 556 (1895).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“The court, fully recognizing in the passage which we have previously quoted the all embracing character of the two great classifications, including, on the one hand, direct taxes subject to apportionment, and on the other, excises, duties, and imposts subject to uniformity, held the law to be unconstitutional in substance for these reasons: Concluding that the classification of direct was adopted for the purpose of rendering it impossible to burden by taxation accumulations of property, real or personal, except subject to the regulation of apportionment,…” <i>BRUSHABER v UNION PACIFIC R. CO., 240 US 1, 12 (1916)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Evidently Congress adopted the income as the measure of the tax to be imposed with respect to the doing of business in corporate form because it desired that the excise should be imposed, approximately at least, with regard to the amount of benefit presumably derived by such corporations from the current operations of the government. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. 220 U.S. 107, 165 , 55 S. L. ed. 107, 419, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912 B. 1312, it was held that Congress, in exercising the right to tax a legitimate subject of taxation as a franchise [231 U.S. 399, 417] or privilege, was not debarred by the Constitution from measuring the taxation by the total income, although derived in part from property which, considered by itself, was not taxable.” <i>STRATTON'S INDEPENDENCE, LTD. v. HOWBERT, 231 U.S. 399, 417 (1913)</i></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“As has been repeatedly remarked, the corporation tax act of 1909 was not intended to be and is not, in any proper sense, an income tax law. This court had decided in the Pollock Case that the income tax law of 1894 amounted in effect to a direct tax upon property, and was invalid because not apportioned according to populations, as prescribed by the Constitution. The act of 1909 avoided this difficulty by imposing not an income tax, but an excise tax upon the conduct of business in a corporate capacity, measuring, however, the amount of tax by the income of the corporation, with certain qualifications prescribed by the act itself.” <i>STRATTON’S INDEPENDENCE, LTD. v HOWBERT, 231 US 399, 414-415, (1913)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The individual, unlike the corporation, cannot be taxed for the mere privilege of existing.

Fisher, 135 Or. 180, 292 P. 813, 819 (Ore. 1930)</i></dd>

<p>My main problem with your attack of my posting is that you accused me of using Wikipedia as a soap box, implying that I was using it to denounce or complain, not to inform. I could say the same of the author of the subject article. Clearly, the author lied about the meaning of the 16th amendment, as though Wikipedia is some kind of soap box from which to propound lies under the guise of "neutral point of view." There is nothing neutral about that lie, is there?</p>
<p>I don't know or care who wrote the article, but I intend to see it corrected so as accurately to reflect the truth. The neutral point of view must not include siding with the government or the IRS. QUITE OFTEN, the government is DEAD wrong. By that I refer to judges, U.S. Attorneys, legislators, and agents of the executive branch, individually and collectively. The Neutral Point of View demands that Wikipedia present those areas of wrongness evidentially, for they have every bit as much validity as the government view.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wikipedia should not denounce people who use the constitution and case law, as I have above, by putting their arguments in a negative category such as "tax protesters." That is anything but neutral, and it impugns without foundation the righteousness of their assertions.</p>
<p>Yes, federal judges throw people in jail all the time for income tax law violations. But if the above court rulings are correct, they show that any implementation of a direct tax upon the people in the guise of an indirect (excise) income tax is a fraud and a violation of the intent and purpose, not mention of the direct language, of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>What does that tell you about our courts, our Treasury Department, or our president who pushes the IRS hard to go after people and forcibly extract taxes from them directly?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I sat in a meeting in which an associate told me Chief Justice Rhenquist once said in a public forum something like this:</p>
<p>"Isn't it wonderful to live in a country where everyone in our federal prisons is there vountarily?"</p>
<p>The Justice was making the point that district federal courts have jurisdiction only in the territories allowed by the Constitution, and that acceptance of jurisdiction outside those territories is optional for the Defendant.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, byCession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;" <i>U.S. Constitution, Article I, Sec. 8, clause 17.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And U.S. Attorneys, according to section 644 of their manual, must recognize that territorial limit in criminal cases. Thus, Americans are not even subject to the jurisdiction of federal courts outside those territories, and most of the states are outside that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Administrative Procedures Act, as supported by Chrysler v. Brown, and State of Ohio DHS v U.S. DHHS, very clearly describes and defines the requirement of <b>substantive regulations</b> to give force and effect to IRS enforcement provisions in 26 USC 7402 and 7604, but no such regulations exist.</p>
<p>By failing to reveal these important facts to the public, the courts allow the IRS to run roughshod over the American public, implementing a direct tax that no federal court can lawfully enforce, except by voluntary submission to its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Most people stamd abysmally ignorant of the above realities, and articles like that on Wikipedia about the income tax attempt to keep them that way. So much for its "Neutral Point of View" flim-flam.</p>
<p>Chuck Conces has researched the above matters thoroughly, and he has created an "Inquiry" which I invite you to take and respond to. You can find it here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/national_lawman/message/553" class="external free" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/national_lawman/message/553" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/national_lawman/message/553</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will test your own truthfulness about the income tax. I'd love to receive your answers.</p>
<p>Yes, I know Chuck Conces has his own tax problems. Every American who tries to hold the IRS to the law does get in trouble. Why does this remind me of the "taxation without representation" complaints of the early American Colonists? Corrupt congress writes laws no ordinary person can understand, and when some sharp persons do ferret their way to proper understanding, corrupt IRS agents attack them with a corrupt US Attorney, who hauls them into court before corrupt federal judges. You know that in establishing precedents through so-called "case law" the judges thereby don't merely interpret the law, they actually change the meaning of the law. How else could the 2nd amendment be completely ignored in places like New York City where you can be jailed for shooting a burgling rapist who enters your home while your family is asleep? How else could so many citizens be jailed and robbed of their assets for not paying direct taxes they don't owe?</p>
<p>I encourage you to answer the questions on the above Inquiry. Then we'll see whether your point of view is neutral.</p>

<p>Dear BobHurt: Finally I'm able to get to some of your comments from May of 2006.</p>
<p>First of all, most of the cases you cited have already been cited here in Wikipedia. Specifically, the following cases are falsely cited over and over by tax protesters on the internet and here in Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Coppage v. Kansas</p>
<p>Truax v. Corrigan</p>
<p>Butcher’s Union Co. v. Crescent City Co.</p>
<p>Murdock v. Pennsylvania (Jones v. City of Opelika)</p>
<p>Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.</p>
<p>Stratton’s Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert</p>
<p>Redfield v. Fisher</p>
<p>Know why? Because on the internet, tax protesters repeatedly copy and paste the same citations to the same cases. This stuff has been passed around on the internet for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, before we get into the materials and the specific reasons why the materials are incorrect, we need to understand some stuff about legal analysis. Let’s talk mainly about analysis of case law.</p>
<p><a name="Some_basic_rules_for_analysis_of_case_law" id="Some_basic_rules_for_analysis_of_case_law"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobHurt_01b9.html" title="Edit section: Some basic rules for analysis of case law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Some basic rules for analysis of case law</span></h3>
<p>First, before you cite a particular court decision you should study a <b>verbatim reprint of the actual text of the court decision</b> – not some tax protester’s “interpretation” or “summary.” In law, you should be looking for something called <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_authority.html" title="Primary authority">primary authority</a>, which means the actual, verbatim texts of constitutions, statutes, treaties, regulations, court reports, etc. If you do not study and understand the actual text yourself, you will eventually get into trouble.</p>
<p>Now, we want to say something in particular about an important difference between statutes and court reports (also called “court opinions” or “case law”). When analyzing the texts of court reports, you must learn to distill something called the “holding” of a case. A holding in a case is basically a court’s ruling in the case. A case can have one or more holdings. Sometimes the holding is clearly stated in the text of the case. Sometimes the holding is not as clearly stated. Unfortunately, learning to determine the holding or holdings cannot be done by studying only one or ten or a hundred cases. This skill is developed by analyzing literally thousands of cases of all kinds on subjects including property, contracts, torts, procedure, constitutional law, criminal law, and so on.</p>
<p>You will never learn everything you need to know about tax law merely by studying tax law. Why? Because many of the legal concepts applied in tax law are not discussed or explained in the texts of the tax cases. The judges who write the decisions for lawyers, not for a lay audience.</p>
<p>Next – and this is oversimplified – you determine the holding or holdings of cases by looking at what the parties were actually fighting about, and then looking to see which of those “fights” were actually decided by the court. That means you cannot simply copy and paste quotations from the text. A MERE QUOTATION FROM THE TEXT OF A CASE – EVEN IF IT’S A VERBATIM QUOTE – IS NOT NECESSARILY A RULING IN THE CASE.</p>
<p>Having read the above paragraphs, you probably now know more about case law than the tax protesters do, or at least more than about 99% of the tax protesters.</p>
<p><a name="The_holding.28s.29_of_a_case" id="The_holding.28s.29_of_a_case"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobHurt_01b9.html" title="Edit section: The holding(s) of a case">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The holding(s) of a case</span></h3>
<p>A related concept is that anything that looks like a “ruling” that the court states in the text of the case that does not constitute something that the parties ACTUALLY FOUGHT ABOUT is not really a ruling in the case. It’s not a holding in the case. Thus, most of the text of a court decision – even where the court is stating what appears to be a “rule of law” -- is not part of the holding or holdings in that case. Now, there is a technical legal term that describes this verbiage that appears to state a rule of law but which is not really a ruling (a holding) in the case. All lawyers in English common law systems (such as England, the United States and Canada) learn this term in the first few weeks of law school. I am deliberately not going to tell you what the term is (at least not right now).</p>
<p>What this means is that a lawyer cannot simply take a quote from the text of a court decision and say that the quote is a “rule for which that case stands.” If you do such things consistently, you may well eventually be publicly humiliated in the presence of other lawyers, and maybe in the presence of your client, and maybe in open court.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p><a name="Non-experts_in_Wikipedia" id="Non-experts_in_Wikipedia"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobHurt_01b9.html" title="Edit section: Non-experts in Wikipedia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Non-experts in Wikipedia</span></h3>
<p>In Wikipedia, non-experts are allowed to edit in fields of expertise. Indeed, you often will not know the level of expertise of a fellow editor who is editing in the article you are also working on. Some editors disclose their credentials only rarely – maybe only in the editor’s user page, or only when someone else brings up credentials.</p>
<p>With the privilege of “editing in areas of expertise without having expertise” comes a related burden, however. The burden is that YOU AS A NON-EXPERT ARE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS OF KNOWLEDGE AS THE EXPERTS. If you screw up, and expert may well call you on it.</p>
<p>For this reason, if for no other reason, Wikipedia users should also avoid making personal attacks on other editors in Wikipedia or calling another editor a liar, or referring to text in an article as a “lie,” especially where the user commenting on an area where he or she has no formally recognized expertise.</p>
<p>Law, medicine, accounting, theology, engineering, physics, mathematics – these would be examples of relatively complex bodies of knowledge where people spend years of formal study and real world experience to attain not only an advanced level of knowledge, but specifically to attain sufficient knowledge that the person’s expertise is formally recognized by other learned persons in that field. And expert status is not something you or I can claim for ourselves in the pages of Wikipedia. Expert status also is not something you or I can claim for ourselves by studying on our own, no matter how much we study. Expert status is something that can only be granted to us by other persons – people already generally recognized as experts in the field, or generally recognized as competent to grant someone the imprimatur of “expert.”</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobHurt_01b9.html" title="Edit section: The Brushaber Case">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Brushaber Case</span></h3>
<p>All right, now let's look at this statement you made:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The above contention (that the 16th amendment removed any requirement for apportionment) is false, as proven by the very same U.S. Supreme Court ruling the article cited.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry, that is incorrect. The Sixteenth Amendment removed any requirement that income taxes be apportioned among the states according to population. As, as explained below, the Court in <i>Brushaber</i> ruled that, based on the U.S. Constitution, as amended by the Sixteenth Amendment, an unapportioned Federal income tax was not unconstitutional. Look, <i>Brushaber</i> is a LEADING CASE. You have to understand that legal experts have studied this case in depth.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing to remember about <i>Brushaber</i> is that the income tax in that case was not apportioned among the states according to population. (In fact, no Federal income tax has ever been apportioned among the states according to population.) Because the tax was not apportioned, Mr. Frank Brushaber was trying to get the Federal income tax law declared unconstitutional. Again, as explained below, the Court ruled against him.</p>
<p>The following quote from <i>Brushaber</i> is false: "the contentions under it (the 16th amendment), if acceded to [ . . . ]”. The parenthetical phrase (“the 16th amendment)”, which does not appear in the text, is a tax protester’s attempt to disguise the fact that the word “it” was actually referring to the word “proposition” in a prior sentence. Guess what! The “proposition” in question was a losing proposition made by Mr. Frank Brushaber. The “proposition” was <b>rejected by the Court</b>.</p>
<p>Now, it's OK to insert parenthetical or bracketed explanatory language into a quotation -- but you should normally follow up with a statement that you yourself have inserted the parenthetical or bracketed verbiage (i.e., this tells the reader that the verbiage is your own explanation and is not in the original text).</p>
<p>And more directly to the point, the verbiage you insert must be ACCURATE. The verbiage cannot leave a false impression about what the quote was saying. Go back and read the actual text of the Court's decision. Again, the "contentions" were the contentions of Mr. Frank Brushaber, the LOSING PARTY IN THE CASE.</p>
<p>Frank Brushaber argued that because the income tax under the 1913 statute (enacted after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment) was not apportioned among the states according to each state’s population, the income tax was unconstitutional. The Court rejected his argument and ruled that the unapportioned income tax was CONSTITUTIONAL!</p>
<p>Now, let's look at this comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[ . . . ] the Court clearly said it does not exempt direct tax (income or otherwise) from apportionment. It merely forces income tax into the class of excises. Thus, the 16th amendment actually does not repeal the apportionment requirement for direct income tax, and it does not repeal the firm denial of Congress' power to tax the people directly [ . . . ]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>False! First, the Court did NOT say that the Sixteenth Amendment does not exempt an income tax from apportionment. Essentially, the Court said that the Sixteenth Amendment DOES repeal the apportionment requirement for "direct income tax". The income tax –whether considered direct or indirect -- was upheld.</p>
<p>Next, under American law there is <b>no such thing as a "denial of Congress' power to tax the people directly"</b>. Indeed, the Constitution <b>specifically grants the power to Congress to impose direct taxes</b> without any limitation as to the KIND of direct tax (the apportionment requirement is a separate issue). Go back and read your copy of the full, actual text of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Forget about an income tax for a moment. Let’s talk about something called a “capitation.” The Constitution specifically mentions a "capitation." That's a head tax, and it’s a direct tax. Even today, Congress could legally enact a head tax on every man, woman and child in the country. (Say, for example, a law that says everyone has to pay exactly $10,000 a year in tax.) A capitation would be a direct tax, and because it would not be an income tax, it would not be covered by the Sixteenth Amendment. That means that a capitation, as a direct tax, WOULD be required to be apportioned among the states by population. (Interestingly, that would be relatively easy to do -- just impose the same dollar amount of tax on each and every person.) DIRECT taxes are SPECIFICALLY allowed under the plain language of the Constitution, and a capitation would be an example of a direct tax.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether you understand what you’re reading when you say that “the Court clearly said it [the Sixteenth Amendment] does not exempt direct tax (income or otherwise) from apportionment”. Think about what Mr. Frank Brushaber was fighting about. The income tax in the <i>Brushaber</i> case was an unapportioned income tax, remember? Mr. Frank Brushaber CONTENDED that the 1913 income tax was unconstitutional because the income tax –which had not been apportioned among the states according to population -- was REQUIRED to be apportioned. (He argued a lot of other stuff, too, but let’s look at this particular fight.) The government and the railroad company argued that the income tax was perfectly constitutional. MR. BRUSHABER LOST THE CASE. THE COURT RULED THAT THE UNAPPORTIONED INCOME TAX WAS CONSTITUTIONAL (LEGALLY VALID).</p>
<p>Remember, Mr. Brushaber was the “appellant.” Looking at the actual text of the case. Brushaber, the appellant, was a stockholder in the railroad. Now look at this verbiage near the beginning of the case:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a stockholder of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, the appellant filed his bill to enjoin the corporation from complying with the income tax provisions of the tariff act of October 3, 1913 (II., chap. 16, 38 Stat. at L. 166). Because of constitutional questions duly arising the case is here on direct appeal from a decree sustaining a motion to dismiss because no ground for relief was stated.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>What was the Court saying here? Well, Mr. Brushaber filed a “bill” in the trial court. That means he filed a lawsuit. Mr. Brushaber was trying to get the trial court to “enjoin” (prevent) the railroad from complying with the 1913 income tax act (the tariff act). To enjoin someone from complying with something means to issue an order that says “thou shalt not comply,” Frank Brushaber was basically saying to the court, “Look, please order the railroad not to pay this income tax, because the income tax law is invalid. I’m a shareholder in the railroad, and I don’t want the company paying an invalid income tax.”</p>
<p>In the trial court, the railroad company made a motion to dismiss Mr. Brushaber’s case on the ground that he had stated “no ground for relief.” That basically means that the railroad was arguing that Mr. Brushaber’s contentions were incorrect as a matter of law. The trial court agreed with the railroad, and issued an order called a “decree” sustaining (upholding) the railroad’s motion. That means that the trial court agreed with the railroad and ruled that Mr. Brushaber’s arguments were incorrect as a matter of law. So Mr. Brushaber appealed, as the “appellant,” to the Supreme Court. The United States Court of Appeals was bypassed, and the case went from the U.S. District Court (the trial court) directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court was now hearing and deciding on his appeal. Mr. Brushaber wanted the Supreme Court to “reverse” the lower court ruling (that means, to rule that the lower court was wrong about the law). However, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.</p>
<p>Read the decision yourself. Do you see the word “AFFIRMED” near the end of the text? Do you understand what it means when a higher court “affirms” the decision of the lower court? It means that the lower court decision stands. It means that the appellant loses the appeal. Mr. Brushaber was the appellant. He lost the case. That means the court ruled against him.</p>
<p>Now let's look at your statement that the Amendment "merely forces income tax into the class of excises." Actually, your statement is more or less correct! What does the term "excise" means for purposes of the U.S. Constitution? Well, taxes can be divided into direct taxes and excises (indirect taxes).</p>
<p>Excises are not now -- and have never been -- required to be apportioned among the states according to population. Instead, excises are subject to something called the rule of geographical “uniformity,” which means basically that excises can’t be imposed just in New York and Montana, for example. If Congress enacts an excise, the excise has to apply all over the country. That means, for example, that a Congress controlled by the Democratic Party could not impose an excise that would apply only in states where Republicans are in the majority.</p>
<p>Income taxes on income from labor, personal services, etc., are examples of excises (indirect taxes). Originally, all income taxes from whatever source were deemed to be excises. That rule was changed – but only for income taxes on income from property (such as interest and dividends and rental income) -- by the Pollock case in 1895. However, even income taxes on gains on SALES (dispositions) of property continued to be classified as excises after Pollock. If you don’t believe that, go back and read the Pollock and Brushaber cases again.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that every Federal income tax ever enacted is and has been an unapportioned tax, and despite numerous attempts by tax protesters over the years to have them declared unconstitutional, no Federal income tax on income from labor, wages, gains from sales of property, etc., has ever been ruled unconstitutional because it was “unapportioned”. Again, the only Federal income tax that has ever been ruled unconstitutional BECAUSE it was UNAPPORTIONED was the 1894 income tax on income FROM PROPERTY (such as interest income, dividend income, and rental income). That was the <i>Pollock</i> case, decided the next year, in 1895. Even in <i>Pollock</i>, the court noted that the income tax on income from labor, personal services, etc., was not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Court noted that it was striking down the ENTIRE tax statute only because Congress had not anticipated that the Court would rule a PART of the statute unconstitutional! After <i>Pollock</i>, the Congress was still free to re-enact a valid income tax on income from labor, wages, salaries, commissions, and gains on sales of property, etc., for example. An income tax on wages, etc., was still an excise, an indirect tax. Even after <i>Pollock</i>, excises were not required to be apportioned (they still aren’t, to this day).</p>
<p>But Congress had no political will to enact an income tax only on the income of the “working man,” with no income tax on things like dividends and interest income. An income tax just on income from labor would have appeared to be unfair to the working man, and an unfair advantage to people who were able to live strictly on things like dividends and interest (in other words, rich folks). That’s why the Sixteenth Amendment was proposed – to get around the <i>Pollock</i> decision and allow the Congress to tax incomes from whatever source (even income from dividends and interest) without apportionment among the states according to population. This is not just technical “legal” stuff, this is background history.</p>
<p>You also stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article failed to point out that the Constitution prohibits Congress from directly taxing people, their labor, or their property because of the historical abuse the founders had suffered from tax agents of King George. That's the Constitution gave Congress the power to tax only the states directly. All of this was based on recognition of the inherent wrongness of the government hindering pursuit of happiness through abusive direct tax agents like the IRS.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, totally false. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits Congress from "directly taxing people, their labor, or their property." You're saying that you really believe that somewhere in the U.S. Constitution, direct taxation is forbidden -- based on “recognition of the inherent wrongness of the government hindering pursuit of happiness”??</p>
<p><b>There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution that prohibits a tax on labor, or on income from labor</b>. Not only that, but plenty of courts have been presented with this argument -- and <b>no court that has been presented with this argument has ever ruled that a Federal income tax law cannot validly tax labor or income from labor</b>.

<p>Here’s more verbiage:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“The court held it unconstitutional, saying: 'The right to follow any lawful vocation and to make contracts is as completely within the protection of the Constitution as the right to hold property free from unwarranted seizure, or the liberty to go when and where one will. One of the ways of obtaining property is by contract. The right, therefore, to contract cannot be infringed by the legislature without violating the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Every citizen is protected in his right to work where and for whom he will. He may select not only his employer, but also his associates.” <i>COPPAGE v. STATE OF KANSAS, 236 U.S. 1, 23 -24 (1915).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The court held WHAT unconstitutional? Again, you apparently copied this from a tax protester web site. The <i>Coppage</i> case is cited over and over. This appears to be a tax protester’s sneaky attempt to leave the false impression that the Court in this case ruled that because the right to follow any lawful vocation, etc., is as completely within the protection of the Constitution as the right to hold property, etc., etc., etc., that the Federal income tax laws are somehow invalid or affected thereby. That is false. Nothing in this case determines anything about the validity of the Federal income tax. Want to know why?</p>
<p><i>Coppage v. Kansas</i>, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), was a criminal case involving a defendant convicted, under a Kansas statute, of <b>firing an employee for refusing to resign as a member of a labor union</b>, for heaven’s sake. No issues of taxation were even presented to or decided by the Court.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at this quote:</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>“That the right to conduct a lawful business, and thereby acquire pecuniary profits, is property, is indisputable.” <i>TRUAX v. CORRIGAN, 257 U.S. 312, 348 (1921).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, you apparently are copying and pasting materials from tax protester web sites without actually studying the cases and determining what these courts actually ruled. Tax protesters cite <i>Truax v. Corrigan</i> over and over, falsely implying that the Court ruled that because there is an undisputable property right to conduct a lawful business and thereby acquire pecuniary profits, the validity of the FEDERAL INCOME TAX is in some way affected.</p>
<p>What was this case about? This was a case where a Mr. William Truax owned a restaurant called "English Kitchen," in Bisbee, Arizona. Mr. Michael Corrigan and others were former cooks and waiters at the restaurant. Corrigan and others allegedly instituted a boycott of the restaurant, after a dispute arose over the terms and conditions of employment. A strike was allegedly ordered by a local union with respect to certain union members employed at the restaurant. The restaurant’s business was allegedly harmed, and Mr. Truax sued various parties on a variety of grounds.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was thrown out by the trial court before the case could be heard, on the theory that Mr. Truax was incorrect as a matter of law. Mr. Truax appealed and the case eventually ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the trial court should not have thrown out the lawsuit, but should have heard Mr. Truax’s case. The case was sent back to the trial court so that a trial could take place.</p>
<p>Can you guess what’s coming next? The Court did NOT rule that because there is an undisputable property right to conduct a lawful business and thereby acquire pecuniary profits that the validity of the FEDERAL INCOME TAX is in some way affected or is in any way invalid or misapplied. <i>Truax v. Corrigan</i> was <b>NOT EVEN A TAX CASE</b>. No issues involving taxation -- or about the validity or application of any TAX LAW -- were even presented to or decided by the Court.</p>

<dl>
<dd>“A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the Federal Constitution.” <i>MURDOCK v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, 319 US 105, at 113; 63 S Ct at 875; 87 L Ed at 1298 (1943).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I love it when tax protesters cite Murdock. This has got to be painful. Murdock, which may also be cited as Jones v. City of Opelika, 319 U.S. 105 (1943), was not a Federal income tax case. The tax protester who cited the above quote out of context conveniently failed to mention what the case was about.</p>
<p>Murdock (or Jones v. City of Opelika) was a case involving the validity of a city ordinance (this one in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, not in Opelika) worded as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That all persons canvassing for or soliciting within said Borough, orders for goods, paintings, pictures, wares, or merchandise of any kind, or persons delivering such articles under orders so obtained or solicited, shall be required to procure from the Burgess a license to transact said business and shall pay to the Treasurer of said Borough therefore the following sums according to the time for which said license shall be granted.</dd>
<dd>'For one day $1.50, for one week seven dollars ($7.00), for two weeks twelve dollars ($12.00), for three weeks twenty dollars ($20.00), provided that the provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to persons selling by sample to manufacturers or licensed merchants or dealers doing business in said Borough of Jeannette.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A group of people who were Jehovah's Witnesses went from door to door distributing literature. They failed to obtain the license under the ordinance. The case ended up in court, and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There was evidence that it was their [the Jehovah’s Witnesses’] practice in making these solicitations to request a 'contribution' of twenty-five cents each for the books and five cents each for the pamphlets but to accept lesser sums or even to donate the volumes in case an interested person was without funds. [ . . . ] The First Amendment, which the Fourteenth makes applicable to the states, declares that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an <b>establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press</b> ....' [ . . . ] It could hardly be denied that a <b>tax laid specifically on the exercise of those freedoms</b> would be unconstitutional.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In other words, the “tax” in this case was, in effect, a license fee imposed on door to door sales people under a city ordinance. The city was trying to exact the fee from Jehovah’s Witness members who were going door to door. Citing this case is an apparent attempt by tax protesters to leave the FALSE impression that the ruling in this case affects the validity of FEDERAL INCOME TAXES, hoping that readers will not look up the actual text of the case. Sorry, but <b>this was not a Federal tax case. Questions about the validity of the FEDERAL INCOME TAX were neither presented to nor decided by the Court</b>.</p>

<dd>“Evidently Congress adopted the income as the measure of the tax to be imposed with respect to the doing of business in corporate form because it desired that the excise should be imposed, approximately at least, with regard to the amount of benefit presumably derived by such corporations from the current operations of the government.

<p>First of all, in <i>Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.</i>, 220 U.S. 107 (1911), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that section 38 of the corporation tax act enacted August 5, 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives.

<p>In <i>Stratton's Independence, Limited v. Howbert</i>, 231 U.S. 399 (1913), a mining corporation argued that the 1909 corporation tax act did not apply to that mining corporation. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument and ruled that the 1909 corporation tax act DID apply to mining corporations, and that the proceeds of ores mined by the corporation from its own premises were INCOME within the meaning of the 1909 tax act. The Court also ruled that the corporation was not entitled to deduct "the value of such ore in place and before it is mined" as depreciation within the meaning the 1909 act. The Court upheld the tax.</p>

<dd>"The individual, unlike the corporation, cannot be taxed for the mere privilege of existing.

<p>You say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly, the author lied about the meaning of the 16th amendment, as though Wikipedia is some kind of soap box from which to propound lies under the guise of "neutral point of view." There is nothing neutral about that lie, is there?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are falsely accusing other people of lying. The article is a statement of well-settled law. Please do not accuse other people of lying merely because you disagree with what they write or because you believe they are incorrect. It is even more infantile to do so when (as far as I can tell) you, BobHurt, do not claim to have any formal training in law or accounting. The vast majority of the cases you have cited are cases that are cited over and over by tax protesters on the internet – and many of the arguments made by tax protesters about theses case have already been discredited right here in Wikipedia! None of the courts in these cases ruled what the tax protesters falsely imply that the courts ruled. The tax protesters are simply cutting quotes out of the cases and then falsely claiming that the quotes mean something other than what the courts ruled.</p>
<p>Worse, in some cases Wikipedia editors have caught tax protesters falsifying quotes or even falsely claiming that a court ruled one way when the court actually ruled the opposite.</p>
<p>You have to understand that much of the ACTUAL TEXTS of the material cited by tax protesters is easily available to a lot of people who don’t have a “tax protester” axe to grind. Protesters who don’t do their homework or (worse) deliberately falsify things long enough are eventually going to get caught. Therefore, when you copy and paste from tax protester web sites, you yourself can get caught up and embarrassed, even though you did not personally intend to deceive.</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know or care who wrote the article, but I intend to see it corrected so as accurately to reflect the truth. The neutral point of view must not include siding with the government or the IRS. QUITE OFTEN, the government is DEAD wrong. By that I refer to judges, U.S. Attorneys, legislators, and agents of the executive branch, individually and collectively. The Neutral Point of View demands that Wikipedia present those areas of wrongness evidentially, for they have every bit as much validity as the government view.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, the article is not necessarily presenting the "government’s" position about what the law is – although I can tell you the government’s position is certainly in consonance with the article. Look, tax lawyers who represent the Internal Revenue Service and tax lawyers who represent taxpayers AGAINST the Internal Revenue Service take contrary positions on lots of issues. Sometimes the IRS wins. Other times the taxpayer wins.</p>
<p>No honest and competent tax lawyer representing a taxpayer, however, is going to take the ridiculous positions or argue the silly arguments put forth by tax protesters. Know why? Not only are tax protester arguments legally incorrect, they’re WORSE: <b>the arguments are LOSERS</b>. Tax protester arguments are, by definition, by and large legally frivolous. That usually means that not only have the arguments lost in court, but they have <b>lost in court OVER AND OVER AND OVER</b>. Do you have any idea how many times tax protesters have lost on the arguments using the cases you cited above?</p>
<p>Next, I’m sorry but neutral point of view does NOT demand that Wikipedia "present those areas of wrongness" evidentially, as you put it. Neutral point of view does mean presenting competing but meaningful alternative viewpoints without taking a Wikipedia position as to whether any one viewpoint is correct. However, under the rules Wikipedia is NOT required to give EQUAL weight to minority viewpoints. Please read the rules.</p>
<p>Also, the tax protesters’ view cannot possibly have every bit as much validity as the government view. The government says the Federal income tax law is valid and is being properly applied. Tax protesters say the Federal income tax law is either invalid or is not being properly applied. One side is correct and the other side is incorrect. One argument is valid and the other is not. One side WINS IN COURT EVERY TIME and the other side LOSES IN COURT EVERY TIME. You are quite wrong.</p>
<p>Either way, the job of Wikipedia is not to determine which view is valid. The job of Wikipedia editors is, however, to assure that any view -- that is presented -- is presented under the Wikipedia rules, especially Verifiability and Neutral Point of View. For example, an implication that the Supreme Court in <i>Brushaber</i> ruled that the Federal income tax is unconstitutional would simply not be Verifiable for purposes of Wikipedia. It would be not only false, it would be unverifiable.</p>
<p>You also say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, Wikipedia should not denounce people who use the constitution and case law, as I have above, by putting their arguments in a negative category such as "tax protesters." That is anything but neutral, and it impugns without foundation the righteousness of their assertions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With all due respect, you are totally incorrect on this point. The term "tax protester" is a technical legal term used by the courts, legal scholars and, until recently by the Internal Revenue Service, to describe persons who espouse incorrect arguments that the Federal tax laws, especially the income tax laws, are invalid or are being misapplied.</p>
<p>Yes, the legal term "tax protester" has indeed come to have very negative connotations over the years. However, <b>the Wikipedia rules do not require that we censor ourselves or refrain from using technical legal terms like these, even where the terms have negative connotations, even where some people find the use of the terms offensive</b>. The mere fact that people’s feelings are hurt or the "righteousness of their assertions is impugned" is of no moment. Obviously, if a tax protester makes arguments that are legally classifed by the courts as “tax protester” arguments, using that specific term, that fact can be Verified. All you have to do is study the actual texts of court decisions. There are court decisions that specifically identify tax protester arguments as a MATTER OF LAW.</p>
<p>A Wikipedia article that reports a particular argument as being designated as a "tax protester" argument by the courts is not impugning WITHOUT FOUNDATION. The article HAS a proper foundation. The fact that the "righteousness" of a tax protester’s "assertions" would be thereby impugned is not a valid reason for Wikipedia editors to censor themselves. I’m sorry but that’s how Wikipedia works.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, federal judges throw people in jail all the time for income tax law violations. But if the above court rulings are correct, they show that any implementation of a direct tax upon the people in the guise of an indirect (excise) income tax is a fraud and a violation of the intent and purpose, not mention of the direct language, of the U.S. Constitution.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are quite incorrect, and here's why. In the cases you cited, no court ever ruled that any implementation of a direct tax upon the people in the guise of an indirect (excise) income tax is a fraud, etc. More to the point, <b>no court has ever ruled any Federal income tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to be unconstitutional</b>. Believe, me lots of tax protesters have tried.</p>
<p>Your argument that "district federal courts have jurisdiction only in the territories allowed by the Constitution" is actually in some sense correct (but not in the sense I think you meant). “Territories” is the wrong word, though. It’s just that the “territories” allowed by the Constitution would be, at a minimum, all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Nothing in the Constitution or any statute prevents the imposition of a Federal income tax in ALL FIFTY STATES and the District of Columbia. Specifically, nothing in Article I, section 8, clause 17 limits the power of Congress to enact tax legislation in ALL FIFTY STATES. Tax protesters have tried many times to get a court to rule that Federal court jurisdiction does not apply in the fifty states -- and the protesters lose every time.</p>
<p>You said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, the Administrative Procedures Act, as supported by Chrysler v. Brown, and State of Ohio DHS v U.S. DHHS, very clearly describes and defines the requirement of <b>substantive regulations</b> to give force and effect to IRS enforcement provisions in 26 USC 7402 and 7604, but no such regulations exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whoever is giving you the information you are citing is hoodwinking you in a big way. Again, the case you are citing, <i>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown</i>, 441 U.S. 281 (1979) is <b>not even a tax case! No issues involving the validity of Federal tax laws were even presented to or decided by the Court</b>.</p>
<p>However, there was a passing reference to the <b>Internal Revenue Service</b> in the <i>Chrysler</i> case in a footnote -- and it’s interesting. That’s because the <i>Chrysler</i> case is sometimes falsely cited by tax protesters for the ridiculous, totally laughable proposition that the Internal Revenue Service is not a government agency (or bureau) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury! Some protesters even claim the IRS is a Puerto Rican collection agency! Unfortunately, tax protesters pass this information around among themselves, but few if any apparently <b>read the actual text</b> of the <i>Chrysler</i> decision. In this case the Court specifically referred to the "Act of July 1, 1862, ch. 119, 12 Stat. 432, the statute to which the present Internal Revenue Service can be traced" -- to use the Court's own words. <b>Nowhere in the case did the Court rule that the IRS is not a government agency</b>.</p>
<p>By the way, tax protesters also claim that the IRS is not a government agency because the IRS was not CREATED by the 1862 statute. They are actually CORRECT that the <i>IRS itself</i> was not created by statute. The 1862 Act created the office of the Commissioner. Unfortunately -- and this point apparently sails right over the heads of many tax protesters because they don't even realize it -- THERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES THAT A BUREAU (OR AGENCY) WITHING THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY BE CREATED BY STATUTE.</p>
<p>Another false and down right goofy claim by some tax protesters is that the agency called the “Internal Revenue Service,” by name, is not “mentioned” anywhere in the Internal Revenue Code. A tax protester made this ridiculous claim earlier this year right here in Wikipedia, and was publicly humiliated. Want to know why?</p>
<p>Ummm, excuse me, but the Internal Revenue Code contains over NINETY specific references to "Internal Revenue Service," by name. No, the IRS was not " created" by statute, but it’s MENTIONED BY NAME by Congress in the statutes many times. And not just in the Internal Revenue Code, but in many other titles of the United States Code -- and in uncodified statutes as well. Moral of the story: For heaven’s sake, at least don’t just copy and paste junk from tax protester web sites. Tax protester literature is full of false statements. Wikipedia editors will shoot you down very quickly. The text of the Internal Revenue Code is readily available on the internet.</p>
<p>By the way, you don't give a full citation to the State of Ohio DHS case, so I'm not going to bother with it, at least not right now. I just happened to have the Chrysler case, because it is one that’s falsely cited over and over by tax protesters.</p>

<p>And regarding section 7604, you’re saying there’s no Treasury Regulation promulgated under this statute? Good grief, what about Treasury Regulation section 301.7604-1? For heaven's sake, this regulation <b>has been on the books since October 23, 1959</b>, and was amended in 1973. Do you know how long it took me to find this regulation? About two minutes. Would you like to see the actual text of the regulation?</p>

<p>On another point, you are absolutely correct when you say that judges don't merely interpret the law, they actually change the meaning of the law! Uh-oh what is Famspear talking about now?</p>
<p>Well, the American legal system is based on something called English common law. Now, English common law is primarily case law -- literally, judge-made law! This is one of the dirty little "secrets" that many non-lawyers don't seem to know -- except that it's not really a secret at all! Our legal system is based primarily on JUDGE-MADE LAW.</p>
<p>Remember that civics or government class you took in grade school? Remember studying that the legislative branch (Congress) makes the law, the executive branch (the President) enforces the law, and the judicial branch (the courts) "only interpret" the law? Well, that statement was a correct description of our legal system, but only up to a point.</p>
<p>What was glossed over in grade school was one of the central realities of the legal systems of England, the United States, Canada and a few other countries: namely that at one time (when we were all either "England" or "English colonies") nearly all of our constitutional laws, our property laws, our criminal laws, our procedural laws, and what came to be our tort laws and our contract laws, were JUDGE-MADE laws, not statutes. Yes, that's right. Not only that, but the judges were allowed to make up the law AS THEY WENT ALONG, even with criminal law. That's why our founding fathers put a "no ex post facto law" provision in the Constitution. And if you doubt that we inherited the common law from our English forebears, pull out your copy of the Constitution and read the Seventh Amendment. Yes, there were also statutes (laws enacted by the Parliament) -- but common law is primarily case law, not statutes.</p>

<p>Again, one of the principles of Wikipedia is that non-experts are allowed to edit in areas of expertise. But, with that privilege comes a burden. Your burden is that you are held to the standards of an expert in a particular field if you edit articles in that field. Just for starters, a person should not cite or quote from a statute, court decision, etc., unless that person has studied the ACTUAL, FULL VERBATIM TEXT of that source -- not merely an "excerpt" or "quote" from that source on some tax protester web site. If, as you have done, you quote from or cite to statutes, cases, etc., without reading the full text of the actual material, you are gonna be hung out to dry sooner or later. Again, in law, you want to cite, wherever possible, to what is called <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_authority.html" title="Primary authority">Primary authority</a>. And there are lots people in Wikipedia who have access to Primary authority. For example, I have immediate internet access (at both home and at work) to the full, actual, verbatim text of almost every reported Federal court decision on taxation (not just income tax, but other Federal taxes as well) since the year 1913 from the U.S. Supreme Court on down to the appeals courts, U.S. district courts, bankruptcy courts, and the U.S. Tax Court, and a lot of cases before 1913. If I go to the trouble to drive down to the county law library downtown or the law school library where I went to law school, I have access to ALL reported Federal cases involving taxation, even back into the founding of the nation. I have immediate access not only to the entire Internal Revenue Code as presently enacted, but also to almost every amendment to the code since 1954, with the congressional committee reports. I also have access to the Federal tax statutes not found in the Internal Revenue Code (yes, that's right, some Federal tax statutes are not in the Internal Revenue Code itself). I also have access to ALL Treasury regulations (including temporary and proposed regs), IRS revenue rulings, revenue procedures and IRS publications. I also have access to gazillions of internal IRS documents -- to which I suspect you not only have no access to but have never heard of -- but which are available to attorneys and CPAs. I have copies of almost every IRS tax form (not just for individual taxes, but also partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, etc.) for every tax year going back to 1979, PLUS THE RELATED IRS INSTRUCTIONS back to 1979. Other editors who may be attorneys or CPAs may have access to all these materials as well.</p>
<p>You have to understand that U.S. tax law is complex in the extreme. You cannot play effectively with the big boys and girls of tax law without the proper tools.</p>
<p>Further, before you cite a particular case as authority, you have to determine whether that case has been overruled, reversed, vacated, distinguished, etc., by a later case. For example, many tax protesters cite a case called <i>Gould v. Gould</i>, not realizing that <i>Gould v. Gould</i> has been effectively overruled by statutory enactment. The <i>Pollock</i> case was effectively overruled by the Sixteenth Amendment. Some cases are expressly overruled and other cases are effectively overruled. You have to be able to determine all this to properly analyze the law. And so on. As a non-lawyer, it would be very difficult to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>You gotta "be right before you write," or you will embarrass yourself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobHurt_01b9.html" title="Edit section: Postscript: Tax regulations Are Not &quot;Required&quot; In Order For Tax Statutes To Be Valid, Enforceable, Etc.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Postscript: Tax regulations Are Not "Required" In Order For Tax Statutes To Be Valid, Enforceable, Etc.</span></h2>
<p>One thing I did not mention above in response to your commentary about the presence or absence of certain tax regulations: <b>There is no law that requires, as a general proposition, that regulations be promulgated under a tax statute in order for that tax statute to be valid, enforceable, etc.</b> Your citation to the <i>Chrysler v. Brown</i> case to the contrary was incorrect on that point. Not only did the Court in <i>Chrysler</i> NOT rule that tax regulations are required but, as noted above, <i>Chrysler</i> wasn't even a tax case at all.</p>
<p>Tax protesters have tried this argument several times and have always failed. Duties imposed by statute cannot be avoided merely because the IRS or some other agency has not promulgated a <i>regulation</i> under that statute. By contrast, the mere fact that a statute specifies that an agency is <i>authorized</i> to promulgate a regulation does not necessarily mean that the agency is <i>REQUIRED</i> to do so. See, for example, <i>Carpa v. Smith</i>, 98-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,627 (D. Ariz. 1998); <i>United States v. Langert</i>, 902 F. Supp. 999, 95-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,504 (D. Minn. 1995); <i>Russell v. United States</i>, 95-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,029 (W.D. Mich. 1994); <i>United States v. Washington</i>, 947 F. Supp. 87, 97-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,129 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); <i>United States v. Hicks</i>, 947 F.2d 1356, 91-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,549 (9th Cir. 1991).
