<p>Do we need all those photos of people who are only marginally related to McEwen's political history? Dobson has endorsed many candidates. Quayle campaigned with a number of candidates. The photo for Portman/Bush is already in Portman's entry. I think that many photos, and so few of McEwen, seriously distract from the very well-written text, because people will expect to see a photo of McEwen and then it's a totally different person. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 14:13, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added the photos of Quayle, Dobson, and Portman to break up the text. There is a McEwen photo alone at the top.

<dd>I saw the photos of McEwen, which were very fitting for the article - it was only the others that seemed extraneous to me. The page is also over the limit for appropriate size, apparently; I wonder if taking off one or two of the photos would help that (or do the photos not make a difference in KB size?). --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 06:57, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The reference to the photos are only instructions to summon the photo file from elsewhere, i.e. the photos themsevles are not stored in the article and don't add much to the size. Yes, it is a long article, but I have been informed that the file sizes aren't as serious an issue as they once were. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 16:20, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous user, 72.49.119.180, who has never made another edit, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a> inserted the information about McEwen's senate run.

<p>I added the tag "Good article" to this because the writing is clear, concise, informative, and npov. The problems still remain from its failed FAC of having better inline citation and at least one good photo... the old fair-use one just does not look good. -<a href="../../../d/o/z/User%7EDozenist_62e6.html" title="User:Dozenist">Dozenist</a> <a href="../../../d/o/z/User_talk%7EDozenist_5328.html" title="User talk:Dozenist"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 23:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, I'll state that inline cites are not necessary and I've had several articles become featured articles without them. And I challenge anyone to find photos for McEwen that won't be objected to at FAC. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 19:07, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>McIntyre/McCloskey facts inaccurate. First, McIntyre was never seated - the House refused to seat either men. Second, the certification was done only after a partial recount showed McIntyre in the lead, not after a full recount. While McEwen's remarks are accurate, the facts underlying the statement as described here are biased.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing was said about recounts. I will consult the Congressional Quarterly Almanac to confirm the facts, but I don't belive the anonymous post above is correct and have removed the "disputed" tag. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 18:40, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The inaccuracy was that neither man was seated - the House did not unseat McIntyre, they just refused to seat either on until they "investigated" the election - neither man was sworn in. So, the term "unseated" is inaccurate. Jimi777 It is correct, so I added the disputed tag back. As someone who lived in the 8th District at the time, I remember exactly how it unfolded, complete with attempts at power grabs on either side (Indiana Sec. of State and the US House). The commentary on the Democrats' hold on power may or may not be true, based on your POV, but the underlying facts that McIntyre was seated is not true.Jimi777 --Jimi777 18:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I changed it from "unseat" to "reject the credentials of". Better? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 19:01, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would also note that the page for the "disputed" tag refers to "significantly inaccurate" information. I don't believe it was appropriate to use it here. And I am once more removing the label. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 19:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the election was still in dispute, "refused to seat either candidate" (to use Charlie Cook's words - a non-partisan source) is better language.

<p>I think an article on McEwan's Export - Scotland's favourite beer - would better serve as an FA. As Arnstein Tranøy points out: This beer kept me alive during four hard years of studying at Stirling University in Scotland. If it did not cost almost £2 in Norway, I would still be drinking it every day.</p>

<p>I recognize this is a well written article but, really, some politician from the USA? I would understand if George Bush (senior, junior or whatever) or Condolezza Rice were featured, but this guy?</p>
<p>Before someone starts explaining me how this article follows all the requirements to become a featured article (yawn), I would like to point out the obvious...that since featured articles appear on the main page, they are the first thing people encounter when entering this website, and reading featured articles is what generally arises interest into the notion of Wikipedia. For example, yesterday's featured article about transhumanism, now that is something that arises world concern. This article about an ex-member of the US House of Representatives? hmmm... maybe it's time to raise the standard on importance/significance for an article to be featured on the Wikipedia main page...<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosameliamartinez_c97a.html" title="User:Rosameliamartinez"><font color="violet"><b>Rosa</b></font></a> 10:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My opinion, as an anonymous user, is that this is the worst feature article I have ever seen Wikipedia use, smacking of astroturfing and turning Wikipedia into a propaganda machine. There is not a single critical word about the congressman here, and I find this amazing. Almost a comically bad choice of featured article.</p>

<p>Whether or not he's a good man is beside the point. This is a really odd selection for featured article. Supposedly, it was picked because it "met the standard" for a good article, but isn't there more to a good Wikipedia entry than meeting some list of standards? Shouldn't a really good article actually have some kind of a point? This is a bland retelling of the bland career of an apparently bland public official, who isn't even currently serving in any kind of public office. Very strange. --67.160.74.124 16:41, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And, not meaning to pile on, I don't even think this is a very good article by Wikipedia's own standards. It's larded with unattributed, NPOV comments like "McEwen was not a man to mince words." What the heck? What kind of a statement is that? And name a politician to whom that doesn't occasionally apply. Yikes. --67.160.74.124 16:46, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This strikes me very much as a Republican POV article - there is no discussion of criticisms of his voting record, e.g.; does everyone love this fellow? Since McEwen is running in an election, featuring it could be seen as a partisan political endorsement.</p>
<p>Comical choice for "Featured Article"... an undistinguished and unimportant American politician. Huzzah! --<a href="../../../r/b/a/User%7ERbanzai_70cb.html" title="User:Rbanzai">Anon Y. Mouse</a> 18:19, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. I thought it was an odd choice because it had utterly zero international appeal, but now it seems even the Americans reading this feel the same way. It's all very well saying that there are certain criteria and all that, as has been pointed out, but shouldn't the featured article also be something that there's a chance someone might give two hoots about? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordrosemount_b3b2.html" title="User:Lordrosemount">Lordrosemount</a> 19:30, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree whole-heartedly with the above sentiments expressed by Rosa and Lordrosemount and others.

<dd>Zanimum's response misses the point and is rather rude - even if we work on more appropriate, more notable political figures and bring them up to FA status, this would absolutely nothing for our position here that minor figures brought up to FA qualityt\ should be <i><b>barred</b></i> from the main page and perhaps from FA quality altogether. Every minor US political candidate has a following of volunteers including many web-savvy college students.

<p>OK. So I've come here to read about this article and what people think about it. I have read the article and I don't think it meets the criteria for featured articles. I don't want to be disruptive, so I'll ask here first: what is the process for nominating an article to be de-featured? Do you have to be able to demonstrate significant changes since it passed FAC? Should I just go ahead and edit the article to improve it? If I think I have improved it, can I submit it to be retrospectively de-featured and then promoted back to featured status based on the changes? (This would involve linking to the version immediately after passing FAC, and comparing to the version being re-submitted to FAC).</p>
<p>In fact, in general, does an article reaching featured status decrease the amount of editing that is done on an article? I have seen plenty of featured articles that could be improved a fair bit, but is there not a process at the end of that to recognise any improvements made to a featured article? In other words, can you get the featured status renewed? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
