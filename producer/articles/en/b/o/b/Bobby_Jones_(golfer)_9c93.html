<p><b>Robert Tyre "Bobby" Jones Jr.</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">March 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> – <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>), born in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, was one of the greatest <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golfers.html" title="Golfers">golfers</a> who ever competed on a national and international level. Of particular note in Jones' case, he participated only as an amateur in a sport long dominated by professionals, competed primarily on a part-time basis, and retired from competition by personal choice at the age of 28.</p>
<p>Jones was a child prodigy who won his first children's tournament at the age of six and made the third round of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Amateur_Championship_130f.html" title="U.S. Amateur Championship">U.S. Amateur Championship</a> at fourteen. As a youth he struggled with his temperament, but he hit his stride in 1923, when he won his first <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28golf%29_6ff2.html" title="U.S. Open (golf)">U.S. Open</a>. From that win at Inwood through his 1930 victory in the U.S. Amateur he won 13 <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Championships_b294.html" title="Major Championships">Major Championships</a> (as they were counted at that time) out of twenty attempts, ranking him behind only <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicklaus_bf8c.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a>' 20 wins and <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Woods_3ce0.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a>' 15 wins (including their US Amateur championships). Jones was the first player to win The Double, both the US Open and The British Open in the same year (<a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>). He is still the only player ever to have won the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28golf%29_cee2.html" title="Grand Slam (golf)">Grand Slam</a>, or all four major championships in the same year. He represented the United States in the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walker_Cup_0029.html" title="Walker Cup">Walker Cup</a> five times, winning nine of his ten matches. He also won two other tournaments against professionals: the 1927 Southern Open and the 1930 Southeastern Open. Jones was a life-long member of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Athletic_Club_5330.html" title="Atlanta Athletic Club">Atlanta Athletic Club</a>.</p>
<p>Jones is considered one of the five giants of the 1920's American sports scene, along with baseball's <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, boxing's <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Dempsey_2f5f.html" title="Jack Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>, American football's <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Grange_b05e.html" title="Red Grange">Red Grange</a>, and tennis player <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Bill Tilden">Bill Tilden</a>. He was the first recipient of the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Athletic_Union_d59d.html" title="Amateur Athletic Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a>'s <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_E._Sullivan_Award_9c48.html" title="James E.

<p>Jones was not only a consummately skilled golfer, but he also exemplified the principles of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportsmanship.html" title="Sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> and fair play. In the beginning of his amateur career, he was in the final playoff of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28golf%29_6ff2.html" title="U.S. Open (golf)">U.S. Open</a>. During the match, his ball ended up in the rough just off the fairway, and as he was setting up to play his shot his iron caused a slight movement of the ball. He immediately got angry with himself, turned to the marshals, and called a penalty on himself. The marshals discussed among themselves and questioned some of the gallery if anyone had seen Jones' ball move. Their decision was that neither they nor anyone else had witnessed any incident, so the decision was left to Jones. Bobby Jones called the two-stroke penalty on himself, not knowing that he would lose the tournament by one stroke. When he was praised for his gesture, Jones replied, "You may as well praise a man for not robbing a bank." The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Golf_Association_b3e5.html" title="United States Golf Association">United States Golf Association</a>'s sportsmanship award is named the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_Award_e2cf.html" title="Bob Jones Award">Bob Jones Award</a> in his honor.</p>

<p>Jones had a unique relationship with the town of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Andrews_f2ea.html" title="St Andrews">St Andrews</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. On his first appearance on the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Course_at_St_Andrews_9621.html" title="Old Course at St Andrews">Old Course</a> in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Open_Championship_520b.html" title="The Open Championship">The Open Championship</a> of 1921, he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round. He firmly stated his dislike for the Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, "Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that." He came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in 1927, he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews_6a54.html" title="The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews">Royal and Ancient Golf Club</a> rather than return with him to Atlanta. In 1958, he was named a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_the_City_8ba4.html" title="Freedom of the City">Freeman of the City</a> of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> in 1759. Today, a scholarship exchange bearing the Jones name exists between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> and both <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emory_University_70c1.html" title="Emory University">Emory University</a> and the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology_33f4.html" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in Atlanta.

<p>Jones was successful outside of golf as well. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology_33f4.html" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> where he was a member of the Owl Club.

<p>When he retired from golf at the age of 28, he concentrated on his Atlanta law practice. In addition, he made eighteen instructional films, worked with <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Spalding_3aab.html" title="Albert Spalding">A.G.

<p>In 1948 Jones was diagnosed with <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syringomyelia.html" title="Syringomyelia">syringomyelia</a>, a fluid-filled cavity in his spinal cord which caused first pain, then paralysis. He was eventually restricted to a wheelchair. He died in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> in 1971 and is buried in Atlanta's historic <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Cemetery_c643.html" title="Oakland Cemetery">Oakland Cemetery</a>.

<p>Jones appeared in a series of short instructional films produced by Warner Brothers in 1931 titled <i>How I Play Golf, by Bobby Jones</i> (12 films) and in 1933 titled <i>How to Break 90</i> (6 films). Actors and actresses, mostly under contract with Warner Brothers, but also from other studios, volunteered to appear in these 18 episodes. Some of the more well known actors to appear in the instructional plots included <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cagney_83fe.html" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_E._Brown_0092.html" title="Joe E.

Various scenarios involving the actors were used to provide an opportunity for Jones to convey a lesson about a particular part of the game. The shorts were directed by the prolific <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Marshall_%28director%29_e0c2.html" title="George Marshall (director)">George Marshall</a>.</p>
<p>Jones was the subject of the quasi-biographical 2004 feature film <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/Bobby_Jones%7E_A_Stroke_of_Genius_8c30.html" title="Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius">Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius</a></i> in which he was portrayed by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Caviezel_8b7b.html" title="James Caviezel">James Caviezel</a>. The film was a major box office flop, grossing only $1.2 million the first weekend and $2.7 million overall, against a production cost of over $17 million. The film was also littered with historical inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The Jones legend was also used to create a supporting character in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_e534.html" title="The Legend of Bagger Vance">The Legend of Bagger Vance</a></i> in 2000, and the event where he called his own penalty is used for the main character, Rannulph Junuh.</p>

<p>Jones authored several books on golf including <i>Down the Fairway</i> with O.B. Keeler (1927), <i>The Rights and Wrongs of Golf</i> (1933), <i>Golf Is My Game</i> (1959), <i>Bobby Jones on Golf</i> (1966), and <i>Bobby Jones on the Basic Golf Swing</i> (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli.</p>
<p>Jones has been the subject of several books, most notably <i>The Bobby Jones Story</i> and <i>A Boy's Life of Bobby Jones</i>, both by O.B. Keeler. Other notable texts are <i>The Life and Times of Bobby Jones: Portrait of a Gentleman</i> by Sidney L. Matthew, and <i>Triumphant Journey: The Saga of Bobby Jones and The Grand Slam of Golf</i> by Richard Miller. Just recently published in 2006, "The Grand Slam" by Mark Frost, has received much note as being evocative of Jones's life and times.</p>
