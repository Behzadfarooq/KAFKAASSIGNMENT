<p>This is the cool and incomprehensible hero, swarthy and musclebound, sporting sunglasses and a large golden <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro.html" title="Afro">afro</a>. His hair is 24-karat gold but is usually said to be yellow or <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blonde.html" title="Blonde">blonde</a>; some viewers even argue about its true color. He is called Bo-bobo for short. He refuses to let people call him Bo! He fights with his nose hair using the Hanage Shinken (sometimes "Fist of the Nose Hair", other times "Snot Fou-You"), as well as simply confusing his enemies. His only weakness, which he discovered while visiting the world of Blabsalot, is the fact that he doesn't have as many deadly attacks. He believes that the Fist of the Nose Hair is sacred and that he shouldn't overuse it. He has three brothers and one sister.</p>

<p>As a kid Bobobo first learned of his ability to hear the voices of hair. At age 7, Bobobo was taken hostage by the hair hunters when his father, a humanoid-like hairball named Tsuyoshi (Pappy in dub), gave him up when the Hair Hunters came to their house and urged him to take on the Chrome Dome Empire. His first mentor was <a href="http://bobobo.webcindario.com/Imagenes/1/jabali%20berrugoso.jpg" class="external text" title="http://bobobo.webcindario.com/Imagenes/1/jabali%20berrugoso.jpg" rel="nofollow">Eboji</a> who taught him how every strand of hair was alive and doesn't like being teased. His second mentor was Master Juice (a juice can), who taught him and Captain Battleship at the time. Bobobo was also friends with Jelly Jiggler.</p>

<p>On the day of the end of the Hair Kingdom, Captain Battleship stated that he was glad that the Hair Kingdom ended due to his lack of acknowledgment. This made Bobobo angry and ended their friendship.</p>
