<p>Despite the fact that both the Astros and Devil Rays deemed him expendable, Abreu firmly established himself as one of the most promising young hitters and strong-armed right fielders in the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, his first season with the Phillies, Abreu led his team with a .312 <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> and collected 17 <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a>, 74 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">RBI</a>, and 19 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a> in 151 games, with 271 <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putout.html" title="Putout">putouts</a> and 17 <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assist_%28sports%29.html" title="Assist (sports)">assists</a> in right field.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_sports.html" title="1999 in sports">1999</a>, he made a brief run at the batting title. His .335 career-high average that season ranked 3rd in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> and was the highest posted by a Phillies player since outfielder <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Gonz%C3%A1lez_b0a9.html" title="Tony González">Tony González</a> hit .339 in 1967. His .446 career-high OBP was also 3rd in the league.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> he was 4th in the league in triples (10), 6th in doubles (42), 7th in walks (100), and 9th in obp (.416).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Abreu led the NL in games played (162), and was 3rd in walks (106), 4th in stolen bases (36) and doubles (48), and 8th in runs (118) and sacrifice flies (9). He also hit a career-high 31 home runs and had a career-high 110 RBIs.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_sports.html" title="2004 in sports">2004</a>, he got his first <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> berth, being voted in as the "32nd man" in online voting on MLB.com.</p>
<p>Abreu finished the season with a .301 average, 30 home runs, and 105 RBI, and ranked among the National League top 5 in 5 offensive categories: <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Run (baseball statistics)">runs</a> (4th, 118) -- the 3rd time in 6 years that he scored 118 runs, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubles</a> (4th, 47), stolen bases (3rd, 40--a career high), <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_on_balls.html" title="Base on balls">walks</a> (2nd, 127--a career high) and <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_base_percentage.html" title="On base percentage">on base percentage</a> (5th, .428).
