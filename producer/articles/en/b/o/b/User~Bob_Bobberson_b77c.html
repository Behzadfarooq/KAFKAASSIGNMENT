He was born on July 19th, 1922 in Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa, the son of Jennifer and Jonathan Halter. He ran for dictator of Iraq in 1962 against Saddam Hussein, but was told he was ineligible for dictatorship on account of his "not being an Iraqi citizen". He came back to the United States where he befriended Ralph Nader and is now one of the biggest components to Nader's success.</p>

<p>Bobberson was born in New York in early July of 1922, but nobody knows the exact date. He was born in one of the side alleys of Harlem to a showgirl and one of her many charges. He was then put in the hands of various hitchhikers to take care of and travel around the country. By the time he was 10 days old, Bobberson had made it from New York to Iowa, and had seen over 7 of the United States greatest states. He was then taken into custody by Jennifer and Jonathan Halter, a couple recently married at the time who happened to find him while at the market selling their produce. They noticed he looked unhealthy and not properly nourished and drove him to the hospital right away. It was there they were told that Bob Bobberson did not exist, and so they created a birth certificate for him with that date on it, and filled in their names as legal guardians of the child.</p>
<p>By the time Bobberson was twelve, he had aquired fifteen other brothers and sisters (2 sets of triplets and 3 set of twins) and was the best produce productionist in the town. He got a job from his father producing produce at age thirteen, and from there his early career took off. He went to school at Reitz Memorial High School where he played the trombone in the school's band and worked for the newspaper creating falsified stories (it is said that Stephen Glass, the New Republic reporter, was influenced greatly by Bobberson). By the time he was seventeen, Bobberson had aquired over 400 dollars from working for his father, and had recieved multiple scholarships for his trombone playing. He took this money and went to McMaster University, where he majored in creative writing and foreign policy. His minor was in nutrition (the school wouldn't let Bobberson have a triple major, although he did take the required classes to do so). He completed the program in just under two years.</p>
<p>Bobberson began working at CiCi's Engineering, but when he was twenty his mother and father were killed in a tragic tractor accident, leaving Bobberson to take care of his fifteen siblings at home (then ranging from ages 8 to 17). He went back to Winchestertonfieldville and began to produce copious amounts of produce while writing on the side. He managed to feed and clothe all 15 children without making them drop out of school, and consequently 13 of them went on to be successful professionals and only two ended up flipping burgers at Whataburger.</p>

<p>While at home taking care of his fifteen siblings, Halter began to write his Dictionary for Cynicals, a complete dictionary of stubborn terms, published in 1970. A strong democrat, Bobberson thundered away against Richard Nixon, the then president of the United States. In his Dictionary, he defined Nixon as "the man with a million chins" and the "dumbass who doesn't know how to tie his shoes". He would eventually use these same words to define other presidents, specifically George Bush and George W. Bush. After reading Bobberson's Dictionary for Cynicals, Nixon was so afraid of losing the upcoming election that he sent spies into the Watergate Building in an attempt to bug the democrats. However, Nixon was forced to resign when his criminal history came out. Bobberson once stated in 1996, "Of all my accomplishments, I am most proud of being a direct link to President Nixon's resignation from office". Bobberson re-issues his Dictionary for Cynicals every Olympic year.</p>
<p>Bobberson is also famous for coining the phrase "junk in the trunk". When his youngest sister, Sally, came home from school one day with a pillow down her pants (the Halter's used corpal punishment and Sally was a very curious child), Bobberson used the term "junk in your trunk" to question Sally. A few days later, Bobberson thought Sally had put another pillow down her pants and used the phrase again, but much to his terror she had not and he was referring to the meat on her bones. From that point on, the phrase "junk in the trunk" has been used to describe larger women and their posteriors.</p>

<p>In 1955, Bobberson went on a tour of Europe and Asia, trying to find the "inner light". He went to many different religious centers, but it wasn't until he went to Iraq that he had a major religious revival. He became a devout Muslim, and in order to truly develop his new faith, moved permanently to Iraq in 1956. In 1962, Bobberson tried to overthrow Saddam Hussein's attempt to take over Iraq, but was told he couldn't contest due to "inelligibility". Since he was not an Iraqi citizen, he was told he could not become dictator or ruler of the country. After seeing Hussein's rule begin, Bobberson left his beloved religion and the country and moved back to New York City, where he had spent his first hours.</p>

<p>While at a bookstore in New York, Bobberson met Ralph Nader, a young author and politician. Bobberson had ordered a Café Vanilla, but couldn't find a place to sit and drink it. He ended up sitting across from Nader and at the time was reading Politics in History, one of Nader's favorite books. The two got to talking and Nader and Bobberson exchanged phone numbers. Over the next years, Bobberson and Nader developed what they thought to be a primary and key campaign procedure, and in 1996 Nader ran for president under the Green Party. He also ran in 2000 and 2004.</p>

<p>Today Bobberson is married to Suzanna Zorn and has three children. They live in Tallahassee, Florida. Zorn never finished High School as a teenager and is now a student at Leon High School, where she plays soccer. Their children, ages 5, 8 and 12 will all go to Leon. Bobberson is still working with Nader and publishing books. In 2003 he was diagnosed with prostrate cancer.</p>
