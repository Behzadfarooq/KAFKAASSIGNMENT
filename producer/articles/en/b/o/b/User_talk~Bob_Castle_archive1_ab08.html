<p>Thanks, for joining Bob. Your ideas are exellent and I will consider then. If you wish you may want to put this template on your user page. {{User WPDad's Army}} if you just copy the coding direct from ths page without editing it you'll get a userbox that tells people that you are a member of WikiProject Dad's Army</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>I will try to think of a way of adding the information that you mention to the plot summaries when I have a chance to do so.

<p>hello Mr Castle</p>
<p>im new here on this and if i have one weakness as a 16 yr old it would be dads army naturally when i saw the oppurtunity to add to an allready excellent resource and expand upon it was thrilled however when checking back at it i was dismayed to find my input had been deleted "a poorly written section".</p>
<p>I find this offensive and upsetting to be told that something i enjoyed doing and did to what i considered to be a high level was poor.</p>
<p>Correct me if i am wrong but the idea of this online resource is to let everyone input no matter how small or large it is.</p>
<p>I ma sorry if this is the wrong way to contact you but being new was not sure how to conatct you.</p>
<p>I would like to hear yor reasons as to why you snubbed my input if you wish you may conatact me on my email address which is tomlea79@hotmail.com</p>

<p>Hi. Just a quick note to say thanks for your support. Hope you're well. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_King_2e0a.html" title="User:Ben King">Ben King</a> 15:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just responding to your comments on Ben's page responding to a note I left, I too am greatly annoyed at how some people are handling it. The latest removals by The JPS basically calling them theft in the edit summary are completely beyond the pale. I have asked and no one has been able to provide me with one shred of evidence of how using a magazine cover to illustrate the subject of said magazine cover violates any copyright. Personally I am thisclose to actually doing what Ben King did, after a fashion, and pulling every image I've ever uploaded of any kind. Maybe if enough people did that, people would start to see sense. I'm not saying blatant copyvios should be allowed -- of course not -- but it's clear Wikipedia needs to either overhaul its "fair use" policy to reflect reality or -- and I'm dead serious -- eliminate images completely if it's going to be such a headache.

<p>Just responding to your concerns over the Fawlty Towers wikiproject I've proposed. I see your point of view. It was a nagging doubt in the back of my mind that there may not be as much content attainables there would be for Dad's Army - seven major characters plus Hodges, Vicar, Verger, Mavis Pike, and other recurring characters, plus seperate pages on 80 episodes/9 series over a course of 9 years is a little different to four main characters, some minor recurring characters, 12 episodes/2 series over a course of 4 years... however, Fawlty Towers has the potential i believe... it's unlike any other sitcom... good as Dad's Army is (and I believe it to be amazing, ingenius, undeniably priceless - one of my all time favourite sitcoms), Fawlty Towers has that edge.. it's sheer impact, influence and popularity which hasn't died since it left us all those years ago is phenomenal... the creme de la creme of all britcoms... anyhow I'm gabbling now... the popularity of the show will attract people, I have faith in it... please reply on my talk page... <a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFoxearth_62c1.html" title="User:Foxearth">Foxearth</a></p>

<dd>Hello Bob, your idea seems fair enough - just one thing though - surely if we were to produce a project on the top 20 Best British Sitcoms - you'd have to murge the Dad's Army project in with this...? Foxearth 08:43, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hiya. Just done some tinkering on AP Films, including adding "See Also", but thought it's probably a candidate for your GA template. Whaddaya think? I'll leave it to you. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 15:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Thunderbirds movies were made by Century 21, the TV series by APF. The name change came about immediately following the end of production and first screening of Thunderbirds, which is what the article says (based on GA's bio). <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 13:40, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I slightly altered it yesterday because I was sure <i>Thunderbirds</i> was made as AP films, but I assume the dates of purchase, etc are still incorrect. I'm afraid I don't have that GA biography - would you be able to correct it, please? By the way, I agree that it is probably a good idea to merge the articles, considering they are almost the same company. I would say that the Century 21 Productions would be the best title to keep, just because it has the cooler name and logo, and is probably the name everybody remembers. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 16:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not almost. They <i>are</i> the same company. It was simply renamed to align it with the merchandising brand. To be honest, I don't see much mileage in correcting the Century 21 article as is. Better to consolidate the two articles and <i>then</i> get the facts straight once over. Pointless duplication of effort, otherwise. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 23:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your extremely kind comments about the Mrs Mainwaring article. I usually get only tendious whinges about this, that or the other! I confess I did it rather on a whim, but I am a fan of Dad's Army and will see what I can do. Anything in mind?

<p>Thanks for your invite to join the Dads Army Wiki Project, I have added myself to the list because I thought that is what I had to do - I hope this is OK.</p>
<p>I will try and dig out some of my old Dads Army videos and put some more plot summaries in, starting with my favourites of course&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Hi. Regarding your edit summary - I really don't see how you can criticise me. I added the quotation to replace a particularly bad attempt at paraphrasing. Also that's the reason I put it where it was (which apparently wasn't integrating it correctly?). You seem to suggest we shouldn't have the quote and I agree, if you ask me the author who added the first reference is being too sensitive - Clarkson makes controversial comments, do we really need every single one! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 19:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Mark83, I wasn't criticising you at all, I'm sorry if you thought so - that paragraph had been appearing about 14/15 times before from an anonymous editor before your edit, and various people had reverted it because it didn't really say anything useful and was written in capitals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that you found the correct quotation and rectified it, so thanks for that. I removed the "turnip face" bit because it didn't seem that relevent, and moved your corrected quotation into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson#Foreigners" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson#Foreigners" rel="nofollow">controvery-foreigners</a> section. The comment was not directed at you, but at the anonymous editor. I wrote the "if we are to have this" to hopefully stop the anonymous editor adding his incorrect section again. Once again, thanks for finding the correct source, and my apologies if you thought I was referring to you. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 20:17, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I understand. Yes, the "turnip face" thing was irrelevant. Just another example of Clarkson's incendiary comments, all of which shouldn't be listed. I also agree that the previous format was not satisfactory - the capitalisation and paraphrasing were terrible.

<p>Referring to a teenage girl as 'WAR LOSING' is rude and xenophobic. Pointing out 'turnip face' that appeared in the sentence to distract from the 'war losing' comment is a weak attempt at a smoke screen. Why are you people so afraid to let Jeremy stand by his comments? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.29.122.16 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.29.122.16.html" title="User talk:86.29.122.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.29.122.16_341f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.29.122.16">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hello, thanks for responding - it's a pity you didn't discuss it before as several editors requested. Jeremy Clarkson is certainly a controversial figure, and his comments are frequently inflammatory. Having read it, I can quite understand why you feel his article is offensive. However, because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we cannot allow comments that are unsourced or present a strong opinion unless they can be sourced. As you will notice, there is a large "controversy" section in his article, full of examples of his comments which have been offensive to people. However, all of these have been opposed by notable groups, newspapers or companies and were widely reported at the time in the press, and thus able to be referenced. Did his July 2nd article generate any newspaper articles or online controversy in the US that you could cite? If there is, the comment criticising the view could certainly be added. However, if it is just yourself, it is best to leave it as it is and people can make up their own mind. After all, the comment is in the "controversy" section, now, so it is quite clear that it was a controversial article in your opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another reason for many different editors deleting your comment was that you were both shouting by CAPITALISING every comment, misquoting the comment and placing it in his biography. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 13:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who on earth do you think you are? Waltzing in here like it's 1952 and deleting people's articles like you own the damn place? You have no right to destroy my work, it took me ages to perfect that and you think you can just delete it? Well I hope you're proud of yourself. Because you are a bully, Bob Castle. You are a bully and a jealous thief. Stop deleting other people's articles and concentrate on improving your own. Good day to you, sir.

<dd>Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. <i>Westenders</i> is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>, which <i>is</i> as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 22:20, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
