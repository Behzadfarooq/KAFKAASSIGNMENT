<p>I didn't know Marley had been shot in 1976. For the sake of clarity it would be helpful to have some idea of the extent of his injuries to separate this from the information about the cancer that caused his death.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 16:16, 17 Dec 2003 (UTC) He was shot in the arm, but it did not penetrate the bone so not a serious injury.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bob Marley's religion</span></h2>
<p>I know he was a Rastafarian for most of his life and that is what his music portrays, but I think that there should be reference to the fact that 7 months before he died he was converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity (the same religion as Haile Selassie) It's kind of a big deal because alot of people who arent in Jamaica(most Jamaicans know it because it was like a huge shock when he gave up the Rasta faith) but people still call him Rastafarian and such. I just think more people should know about this and it should be on this little page here. Jah bless</p>
<p>Bob Marley did not give up his Rastafari faith and claiming he did is dishonest POV pushing, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 13:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this should be mentioned in the article. However I don't agree with you that he "gave up his Rasta faith". Some rastas may see people joining the Eastern Orthodox church as people who "give up their Rasta faith", but the members themselves surely don't. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeklund_0181.html" title="User:Teklund">Teklund</a> 07:58, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I am sure he reaffirmed his commitment to Rastafari in the post chemotherapy interview he gave (with a pic without dreadlocks), and there is no evidence he gave up his Rasta faith by being baptised into the Eastern Orthodox church, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:43, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just put an article with the Christafari point of view about his Ethiopian Orthodox Church conversion. I don't like this group and don't agree with them, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> July 1, 2005 18:33 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Even if you don't like the group Christafari are'nt the quoted sources enough to prove he gave up Rastafarianism? also is there anywhere that I may read the post chemotherapy interview where you said he reaffirmed his faith in Ras Tafari?. Jah bless. Also Im not to good with words so I just want everyone to know im not trying to start an argument, if I sound that way at all I apologize.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The more I read about Christafari the less certain I am of their reliability. They have a strong evangelical Christian agenda, and seem happy to manipulate tghe truth in support of this agenda, so I certainly don't see it as proof. I can't remember where exactly I saw the interview. It must have been in the UK, and was a newspaper, either a music paper or a tabloid. I really should research the issue more. No, you don't come across as at all argumentative (even without the disclaimer). You get to spot the argumentative types working here, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> July 4, 2005 15:35 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Christafari group has very legit sources. I think that you are being way too prejudice simply because they're a Christian group. So far all I see is an anti-Christian agenda to try and make it seem like Marley would never give up the Rasta. Lets be fair with the sources and not pick at the people providing them. Marley died a Christian, not a Rasta.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is a such a minority belief that it doesn't need to be mentioned, and there is no evidence for it. As he claimed his Rasta beliefs were stronger than ever months after his baptism we have a source that he did not die a Christian. The problem I find withg Christafari is the aggressive way they try to convert Rastas into Christians, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 00:21, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Christafari website mentions freely their sources as evidence and proof that Bob Marley converted to the Eastern Orthodox religion before he died. He was buried in an Eastern Orthodox church; in Jamaica, it was widely known. Personally, I feel that Bob is too intelligent to think that Mr. Selassie was Christ reincarnated, when Mr. Selassie himself denied that he was divine. Squeakbox, you are obviously biased against Christians. The least you can do, to be on even footing in a debate with the Christafaris, is provide evidence and cite your sources, instead of just stating your personal beliefs. - et3rnal D</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is your <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">point of view</a>. There is no doubt that he baptised in the EO faith but that doesn't mean he stopped being a Rasta, and for us to claim that he did would be unacceptable POV. We are not here to debate the validity of Selassie I as God or not. Until you can provide a source that he abandoned his Rastafari faith it musn't go in the article, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 00:17, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that you are both "right " to a degree. Bob Marley was Baptized into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church seven months before he died, and this can be substantiated by the fact that he was given an Ethiopian Orthodox funeral. This Church would not have performed a funeral ceremony for anyone who was not a member, and in order to become a member you had to denounce the belief that Haile Selassie was christ reincarnate. Thus, Bob must have done this in order to recieve a funeral that was endorsed by the EOC. The second set of evidence that would support his conversion to the Christian faith is in the interview with the EOC's then Arch Bishop Yesehaq, who described Bob's conversion process in detail as a half hour of weeping. Now, even though he may have been converted to the Christian faith insofar as the fundamental teachings of the Bible, that certainly does not mean that he was somehow taken away from his culture. This is where there is a lot of confusion, because people tend to blend culture and religion into one rigid formula. Since the white westerners are primarily a Christian people, the Christian faith is commonly tied in as a "white-man's" practice. However, just because the white western culture practices the Christian faith, that does not mean that it is exclusive to white people, or to any one race for that matter. Quite conversely, the original figures of the Bible were indeed not white, and the teachings of the Christian faith are that of freedom (with the exception of some of the more radical man-made factions). So aside from the misplaced worship of Haile Selassie, Bob Marley pretty much followed the inherent principles of the Christian faith to begin with.</p>
<p>Whether or not he was a 'true' Rastafarian at the time of his death depends on how you define Rastafari. If it means that you believe that Haile Selassie is God, then no, Bob Marley was no longer a Rastafarian. However, if by 'Rastafarian' you meant that he still sported his Dreads and believed in the uprising of the black people, then yes he may still have been a Rasta. In my opinion though, I don't think that he was a Rastafarian. Being a political activist for a racial group is a completely seperate object from one's faith, with the exception being Rastafari because it espoused the belief that a living black man was God. Thus, if he rejected this in the end of his life, then it is impossible to continue to regard him as a Rastafarian. Keep in mind that my last statement was completely my own opinion.</p>

<p>-In a newspaper interview with Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq done by Barbara Blake Hannah,November 25, 1984, in the Gleaner's Sunday Magazine (pages 2,3,11), titled 'Abuna Yesehaq Looks Back on 14 Years of Ministry in Jamaica' the following was said about Bob Marley's baptism.</p>
<p>"Bob was really a good brother, a child of God, regardless of how people looked at him. He had a desire to be baptised long ago, but there were people close to him who controlled him and who were aligned to a different aspect of Rastafari . But he came to Church regularly. I remember once while I was conducting the Mass, I looked at Bob and tears were streaming down his face...When he toured Los Angeles and New York and England, he preached the Orthodox faith, and many members in those cities came to the Church because of Bob. Many people think he was baptised because he knew he was dying, but that is not so...he did it when there was no longer any pressure on him, and when he was baptised, he hugged his family and wept, they all wept together for about half an hour."</p>
<p>-In an Interview the following year (9th July, 1995) on the JBCTV (now called TVJ) program "Profile" he was asked by host Ian Boyne about the bapistim of Bob Marley. Below is a clip from that interview</p>
<p>Ian: You baptized Bob Marley? Yesehaq: I did baptize Bob Marley in the presence of his wife Rita Marley and his children. Only the family, because he was not so willing to have it officially, it was difficult for him...which I don't want to describe.</p>

<dd>I think on the strength of your sources that to put in the article that he left his Rasta faith to become a Christian would be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>. I don't see any evidence that Marley stopped being a Rasta or stopped worshipping Haile Selassie. You haven't sourced your claim that one has to denounce Rastafari to be baptised EOC, and I believe this claim is incorrect. Your own POV comes out with <i>his misplaced worship of Haile Selassie</i> to then claim <i>Bob Marley pretty much followed the inherent principles of the Christian faith to begin with</i>. I don't agree with either statement. All you have proven is that he was baptised EOC, and we know that anyway <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, perhaps I was a little vague in my explanation, so let me try again. First of all, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is indeed a Christian Church. Thus, the doctrine of said Church would have to revolve around the teachings of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and the aknowledgement that he died upon the cross so that the sins of man may be forgiven. This can be seen on this website at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Christianity</a>, and also in the New Testament of the Bible. In fact, you can go and read the scriptures in several different versions of the Bible at this website; <a href="http://www.ibs.org/bibles/amharic/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.ibs.org/bibles/amharic/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibs.org/bibles/amharic/index.php</a>. I have it linked to the Amharic Bible which is the official translation of it into the primary language of Ethiopia. In any translation, no matter what the different historical facts or date disputes may be, the central key to the religion across any denomination is the worship of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.</p>
<p>So now, since we know that Christianity requires the worship of Jesus Christ of Nazareth as God, we can compare it to the Rastafari doctrine in detail. Look at the Wikipedia page for Rastafari here <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Rastafari</a>. It clearly states that the distinguishing belief between any Christian doctrine and that of Rastafari is that Rastafarians believe that Haile Selassie is God in the flesh. They believe that he has come back down to Earth in the form of this man, and so they worship him as their Lord and Savior. Therefore, it would make sense to believe that Bob Marley did reject Haile Selassie as his God at the time of his baptism because it goes against the doctrine of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. You cannot believe that Jesus Christ is God at the same time as you believe that Haile Selassie is God in the Christian religion. The Haile Selassie factor makes Rastafari a completely seperate religion from Christianity, in the same way that Judaism is a seperate religion despite its background in the Old Testament. Of course, you could argue that certain passages of the Bible support the belief that Jesus would come back to Earth with a new name and a new appearance, thus making it viable that Haile Salassie is God. However, that argument would be obsolete in this case because the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, to which Haile Selassie himself belonged, did not endorse that idea. In fact, as can be seen here <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia</a>, Selassie had commissioned the Arch Bishop to set up in Jamaica in order to convert them to the proper teachings of the Christian doctrine, which in essence is the worship of Jesus Christ, and not Haile Selassie. So it is highly unlikely that Bob still held to his belief in Haile Selassie when he was Baptized into a Christian Church. Of course, as you say, there is no interview with Bob that directly explains about his conversion. However, based upon the nature of both Christianity and Rastafari, and the fact that the EOC was in Jamaica for the specific purpose of dispelling their belief in Haile Selassie as God reincarnate, I cannot see how it is possible for Bob to have been baptized while holding strong to his original beliefs</p>
<p>Now there is the question of whether or not he was a Rastafarian at the time of his death. In order to be able to answer this, you would have to define what a Rastafarian is. On the Rastafari page of this website, it says that the principle of the Rastafarian movement for the most part was the adoption of Haile Selassie as God. So if you were to base whether or not Bob was a Rastafarian on that alone, then no, he was not. The fact that he was baptized into the EOC is very strong evidence that he did not believe this any longer. On the other hand, if you mean Rastafari as a culture, then he was indeed still a Rastafarian. By culture, I mean appearance and practices. For example, the sporting of the Dreadlocks, and the use of Marijuana. Both of these are cultural practices that can exist wiothout the central ideological belief in Haile Selassie.</p>
<p>To agree with you a little, I can't say that I knew exactly what was going through Marley's mind as he left this Earth. There is still the possibility that he retained his belief in Haile Selassie despite his baptism. Unfortunately, neither of us will ever know this for sure. I do find it odd, though, that Bob Marley would have actively sought his own membership in the EOC if he didn't plan on changing his beliefs. No one coerced him to do it, so it was of his own free will.</p>
<p>On one last note, can you provide some source of evidence that would favor the idea that he did still believe in Haile Selassie after his baptism? Or is that just your POV? What makes you believe that he did?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't really been following this discussion, I just wanted to say that Wikipedia is not here to answer conclusively the question of what Marley's religion was at any point in his life. If he said he was Rastafarian, and then he said he was Ethiopian Orthodox, then we can report that. If those two religions are incompatible with each other theologically, then we can explain that. However, it is entirely possible for an individual to hold idiosyncratic ideals irrespective of their religion. My own father goes to a church whose teachings (some of them) he vehemently disagrees with, and there are numerous Catholics who don't know or don't care that their Church requires them to believe in stuff that they find absurd. It's entirely possible that Marley wanted to be Ethiopian Orthodox for whatever reason, despite feeling that he was also Rastafarian -- he wasn't a theologian and was entitled to hold whatever beliefs he wanted to, even if they're inconsistent with each other and/or with the beliefs of the church(es) he belonged to. I also would like to note that I believe one of the core tenents of Rastafari is that specific doctrine is not important (the whole "ism and schism" thing) -- he might have considered it a very good Rasta thing to do to hold inconsistent religious beliefs. In the end, though, we should not be speculating about Marley's beliefs where he has not clarified. If he was Rastafarian for awhile, and then adopted a different religion without renouncing the other, then let the article say that. We don't need to be drawing conclusions for the reader. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 06:19, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think what we have in the death sub-section is sufficient. There is no serious belief or evidence that he renounced Rastafari or even considered changing his religion. All there is are certain Christian groups who try to discredit Rastafari, and one of the ways they do this is by claiming that he converted to Christianity. We have stated the fact that he was baptised into the EOC, and to do anything else would definitely be original research. I don't believe the Christafari etc view is anywhere near mainstream enough to consider adding it to this article. If their views were to get widely reported we could do so, but as long as they are a tiny minority group, and the only source for their ideas are their own websites, we should let things be as they are, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:17, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just wanted to say, that there are several Christian Rastas, who do not beleive that Selassie was a God in the flesh. However, they still keep the nazarene vow. The most famous ones are Yabby You and Ras Michael. Ras Michael is a memeber of Ethiopian Orthodox Church. 70.48.39.96 04:38, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ras Michael is a Rasta. Listen to his music. There is no such thing as a Rasta who does not believe in Selassie I and to claim so for POV reasons is an insult to the faith. Are there any Christians who don't believe in Jesus? Of course not or they would not be Christians, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 13:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But when you think about it , it makes sense that people would try to cover up the fact that he converted. There are reliable sources including Judy Mowatt (one of bob's back up signers) and Tommy Cowan - a friend of Bobs who both speak of his conversion as fact and as something that later on led them to also convert. The media loves Bob Marley and the whole movement that is Rasta , It is a marketable idea , and they would have suspected that leaking such knowledge into the mainstream would have caused serious damage to the impact and money making ability of Rasta as a movement.. Consider</p>
<p>What makes sense is people fostering the lie that he dropped his Rasta faith in order to promote their own Christian POV. This is not a forum and is not the place to promote Christian views. Christianity is the multi-billion dollar industry not Rastafari, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 13:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I dont think I'ts fair to talk about something without knowing anything about it. There are major differences between the different christian denominations, and probably some western types of christianity are a multi-million dollar industry, but to put that stamp on the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is really offensive. As an orthodox christian (even though I'm from eastern europe), I really dont see my church as a money-making machine, since it doesnt ask for money from the believers (except natural disasters when the church is involved in the relief effort), even though some people choose to donate money for the restauration or construction of a church. But that doesnt qualify as a "multi-billion dollar industry", I think... Dizzee ignorant</p>
<p><br />
SqueakBox I humbly come with I opinion. I resent your statement that "there is no such thing as a Rasta who does not believe Selassie I" Because it's not true and its not a proper representation of Rasta. There are many Rastas who believe in Yeshua Moshiach as Lord and Saviour. Were called Jesus Dreads or Rastas of Christ Doctrine. Famous one is Yabby You whom was the original Jesus Dread (having been given the title by a Rasta bredren who knew he was praising Yeshua and not Selassie I) also the prophet Gad(or Gadman) leader of the 12 Tribes of Israel mansion of Rastafari (which is the largest mansion by the way) worships Yeshua and one of the distinct differences between 12 Tribes and the other mansions is the fact that they do NOT believe in the divinity of H.I.M. Haile Selassie I. Messian Dread is also a well known Jesus Dread. InI is also a Jesus Dread. While all of us Jesus Dreads worship the true saviour Yeshua, we do as well Honor H.I.M. as we know he is a descendant of King Solomon and a defender of the faith. Sorry I just felt I had to say something. It might be the case that Bob Marley had become a Jesus Dread before he died. Iman know he was influenced alot by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq, and also the prophet Gad. And in an interview with Bob's wife she stated she was confused one day when Bob was in extraordinary pain one day from his cancer and he cried out "Jesus take me!" and she wondered why he said "Jesus" instead of "Selassie". These are only InI humble opinions. JAH RasTafari!</p>
<p>JAH bless</p>
<p>Well my point is that the name rastafari is relaqted specifically to Selassie I. Are there Christians who don't believe in Jesus? Muslims who dont believe in Allah. If people want to worship Yeshua they should be called Yeshuans, etc. There are those who see selassie as the living God, these are the Rasta people. Having said this my above comments were aimed at the anti-rastafari sect <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christafari.html" title="Christafari">Christafari</a> whose members have been editing various Rastafari based articles, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semi protection</span></h2>
<p>Normally, I'm not big on needless protection, but I've been thinking about requesting semi-protection (no anonymous editing) for this article. If you look at the history, it is almost entirely anonymous vandalism and people reverting it. I watch this article pretty much for the sole purpose of reverting (usually) anonymous garbage. Does anyone else think this is the right way to address the problem?</p>
<p>Just as a matter of illustration, there have been about 100 edits in the last two weeks since <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> worked on the article organization. If you look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Marley&amp;diff=40437026&amp;oldid=38481766" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Marley&amp;diff=40437026&amp;oldid=38481766" rel="nofollow">the diff</a>, though, barely anything has happened in those 100 edits; it's almost all vandalism/cleanup. As I said, I'm not big on protection, but cleaning up after vandals seems like a waste of everyone's time. On the other hand, <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">Gay</a> isn't even protected as far as I can tell, so maybe I'm asking for too much. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 15:31, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suspect it is Bob Marley as a person which attracts the vandalism and that semi-protection would only be a semi-fix.

<dd>It's been documented in several of the biographies and film documentaries that his musical popularity did a great deal to bring Rastafari to the attention of people all over the world who didn't know about it. Also, he was well known for devoting a short portion of his concert to explaining who Haile Selassie I was and what Rastas believe; he also discussed the faith at length in interviews.

<p>I also disagree with your claims about them being non-prominent members. Is Ropn Wood a non-prominent member of the Rolling Stones?

<dd>I agree with Ezeu that there should be separate articles for the two incarnations of the Wailer's band, one for the original Wailers and one for the later "Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers". The problem was that the articles were not properly linked and cross-referenced from one another, not that they existed at all. Adding details about Wailers band members to <b>Bob Marley's <i>biography</i></b> is not appropriate, but it is appropriate for a Wailer's article if there is not enough information for a separate article on the person. In short, I don't think the Wailer's articles should redirect here; it should be sorted out properly. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 16:54, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you want to sort everything out do so but don't leave the mess there was this am. Even were the Wailers to have a separate article wouldn't be any reason to not include his close colleagues over several years from appearing in this article which is desperately in need of more detail not less as it is extremely patchy about his music carreer.

Frankly it seems both arrogant and ignorant (quite a lethal combination if you ask me) and I have no idea why it has been included. I'll admit that I don't care much for Legend or the identical compilations that have attempted to outshine it, but this idea that Blackwell somehow commercialised his music is ludicrous. The author says that, after Burnin', "[his music] became steadily more mellow and digestible" and tries to back himself up by comparing 1970's "Mr Brown" with 1977's "Natural Mystic".</p>
<p>I don't know what point he's trying to make. Natural Mystic was first written back with Mr Brown in 1970, and while I admit that I prefer the original version, I know that this is simply my personal taste. There is nothing wrong with Exodus and if it succeeded in spreading his message, then it's probably a very healthy candidate for Time magazine's award.</p>

<dd>In the 1960s the Wailers were only really known in Jamaica and perhaps amongst Jamaican immigrants and ska/reggae fans in the UK. One album was released in Jamaica at this time, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wailing_Wailers_acc1.html" title="The Wailing Wailers">The Wailing Wailers</a></i>, collecting their Jamaican hits recorded at <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_One_4343.html" title="Studio One">Studio One</a> in the mid-60s. Then in the early 1970s several albums were released: <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_the_Wailers_0883.html" title="The Best of the Wailers">The Best of the Wailers</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Rebels_5773.html" title="Soul Rebels">Soul Rebels</a></i> in 1970 and <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Revolution_8878.html" title="Soul Revolution">Soul Revolution</a></i>/<i><a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Revolution_Part_II_8129.html" title="Soul Revolution Part II">Soul Revolution Part II</a></i> in 1971. As most Jamaican groups at the time, most of the group's output did not appear on albums, but on singles instead. The Jamaican music scene has always relied more on singles than albums, unlike the Western music world which is album-centered. <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_A_Fire_6de0.html" title="Catch A Fire">Catch A Fire</a></i> was their mainstream debut, released on a large international record label and did recieve marketing and publicity, which the previous albums really hadn't had any of. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeklund_0181.html" title="User:Teklund">Teklund</a> 20:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
