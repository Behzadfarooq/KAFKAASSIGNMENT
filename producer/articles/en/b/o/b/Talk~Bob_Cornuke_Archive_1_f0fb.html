<h2><span class="mw-headline">Just so folks understand</span></h2>
<p>Jason Gastrich is POV pushing (again) in this article, which was a simple few sentences of "hero worship" from the born-again perspective until I found it and improved it.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and figure that it's going to become yet another conflict involving Gastrich because he cannot approach any of these subjects without POV pushing. He's here, after all, to make Wikipedia more Christian (at least, from his point of view) and insure that "Christians have a voice" at Wikipedia. The consequence of that is that Gastrich is unable to separate that from his "contributions" whenever the subject even peripherally involves things he considers "Christian." Gastrich is also using Wikipedia to promote his Christian heroes; and being somewhat developmentally disabled on an emotional level, he acts very much like a spoiled child whenever something is written that he presumes is bad. We keep seeing it in the article about Bob Cornuke.</p>
<p>Bob Cornuke, in the reference cited in the article, claims to have found the anchors of the vessel that Paul was sailing when it was involved in the shipwreck described by the account in Scripture.</p>
<p>Now, I approach this claim scientifically, as a trained and skilled investigator, and I accept that it's a <i>claim</i> that has been made. I don't assume that the items are the anchors of Paul's ship just because he says they are. That's not how it works. No one really <i>knows</i> what it is that Cornuke claims to have found--even <i>he</i> doesn't <i>know</i>. <i>He</i> makes the <i>assumption</i>, based on his perspective, that he's found the anchors. No one else <i>knows</i> that, and there's no independent, qualified verification by the archaeological community.</p>
<p>Because Cornuke has made the claim, and because Cornuke is one of Gastrich's personal heroes--<i>and</i> because this is something that Gastrich <i>wants</i> to believe (being a Biblical literist an inerrantist), he (or his AOL sock) keeps changing my "claims to have found" section of that sentence to "has found." Then he accuses me of "POV pushing."</p>
<p>I just report the facts, i.e., Cornuke claims to have found the anchors from the ship that Paul was sailing when it sank, as described in Acts 27. I have yet to find any independent, verifiable, peer-reviewed article from any archaeological reference that these items <i>are</i> the anchors of Paul. In other words, no one else seems to want to make that assertion. Shucks, the reference that is associated with that part of the article was found and inserted by me. It's a link to an article <i>written by Cornuke</i>.</p>
<p>Gastrich, the born-again Christian (sort of), whom originally wrote the stub article on Cornuke, and whom argues hither and yon at Wikipedia and engages in tantrum throwing when he doesn't get his way, changes it to "has found," claiming that the <i>other</i> version is "POV pushing."</p>

<dd>I'm an inerrantist and I think that's a stupid claim to make. What, did Paul scratch his initials on the anchors of every ship he was on? <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 01:57, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For whatever it's worth, I don't have a problem with Cornuke claiming that's what he's found, as long as an encyclopedia article is clear that it's just a claim. I understand and agree with your comment. I simply think that it's less POV if we make it clear, especially given the lack of supporting evidence, that it's a <i>claim</i>, and nothing more. To argue or insist otherwise is POV-pushing...and, in the case of some, wishful thinking. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 04:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, notice a couple of things. First, Gastrich boasts of seeing a video and reading the book (as I have also done). He makes no attempt to explain to us exactly what compelling evidence exists, especially independently verified, that provides any real support for the claim that the anchors are those of Paul's vessel. Second, <i>this time</i>, he did not change the article to read as he would prefer it to read, which suggests that he <i>did</i> read my commentary, as written above, knows he won't get away with another POV edit, and tried tossing a pathetic insult as he retreated. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 03:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem with Current Article</span></h2>
<p>First of all, I would like to apologize for my entrance onto Wikipedia and my initial attempts at editing this post. I am brand new to this forum and this kind of concept and I have been, since the first “debacle”, familiarizing myself with the rules and regulations of this site to ensure compliance with the guidelines and cordiality with all the editors.</p>
<p>Instead of just editing the live post, as I did previously, I am offering various refutations and reasons that the current post is incorrect and biased and provide explanation why it should be rewritten. Additionally, I will detail how and why it violates the published rules, goals and guidelines of Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Policies%2C_conventions_and_guidelines" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Policies%2C_conventions_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I have also offered a rewritten version of the article that strives to reflect an NPOV and that more accurately presents Bob Cornuke and that upholds the 5 pillars of Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, below are 8 major problems with the current article:</p>
<p>1. The post, in general, describes Bob as a "con artist" and a "fraud", with most of these accusations referenced from The New Zealand Cult List <a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, which is offered as a valid source for these terms. This website provides no sources or citations from these accusations and cannot itself be considered a source<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) . These words clearly cast Bob in a negative light, even though they are hidden in “neutral” language. Plus, they mostly originate from the contentions of a "competitor" (Roy Wyatt, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), who has himself been subject to these same kinds of claims, even though they are not prominently discussed on Wyatt’s Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>These are spurious accusations in nature (refer to discussion below on Mt. Sinai discovery) that come from a rival archeologist and should have no place on Wikipedia, as this violates the top 2 of the 5 pillars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> . There are plenty of other forums where accusations can be aired, regardless of merit, but it is a stated goal of wikipedia.org not to be one of these forums.</p>
<p>Additionally, neither Cornuke nor Williams have ever been found guilty of any form or fraud or other malfeasance by any court of law! So, it is inappropriate and unjust for these accusations to be presented here, and even given prominence since they are included in the opening paragraph of the post.</p>
<p>2. Additional evidence that this is a biased post against Bob Cornuke comes from an outside source, Google. Regardless of the editors’ efforts to disguise the accusations with "neutral" language, it is plainly a biased POV and can be seen when a Google search is done on the term "Bob Cornuke" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bob+Cornuke" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=bob+Cornuke" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. The Wikipedia article is the 6th result, and notice the description, under the title, that’s presented:</p>
<p>"Ten Reasons to be wary of Bob Cornuke · Dictionary of Cults &amp; Religious Groups List: C See: Bob Cornuke; A Critique of Bob Cornuke with a timeline Following ..."</p>
<p>This immediately gives the impression that Bob Cornuke is part of a cult and that everyone should be wary of him (there is no basis or reference for the accusation that he is in a cult and it is solely the opinion of a dissenter and should be immediately dismissed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The accusation is contained on the New Zealand Cults List <a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and is not cited or referenced by any valid outside source). This description on Google clearly presents a biased picture of Bob Cornuke BEFORE the user ever has a chance to see the actual article! Add to that Wikipedia’s reputation of being known as an online "encyclopedia", and it raises these baseless accusations from the level of banter between rivals and critics to established truth.</p>
<p>3. The opening paragraph of Controversy and Criticism is misleading. While Wyatt was the first to name Jabal Al-Lawz as the place of Mt. Sinai, Cornuke and Williams were the first to bring photographic and video evidence from the site, and subsequently add merit to Wyatt's claims. Wyatt is also credited in Bob and Larry’s book The Mountain of Moses. <a href="http://www.pinkoski.com/files/index.php?id=36" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pinkoski.com/files/index.php?id=36" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. A rephrasing of this material, at the least, is warranted (reference the modified article below) and more appropriately, this reference should be removed (See Self-published Sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) as it fails to uphold the Wikipedia standards for a valid reference..</p>
<p>4. The inclusion of the lawsuit from Kathryn Proffit is also frivolous and only seeks to tarnish Bob Cornuke and give merit to the "fraud" and "con-artist" accusations. Anyone who was been around the world of business or ministry, especially over the last 10-15 years, has probably been sued or knows someone who has. Anyone can accuse anyone of anything and file a lawsuit, if they have the money and audacity to pursue the case, regardless of the merit of the claim. Let me repeat that, regardless of the merit of the claim.</p>
<p>This lawsuit has still not come before a judge for settlement and her initial request for injunction was denied, casting some doubt on the merit of that claim, especially since it's based on an un-witnessed, oral agreement <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. If, and only if, Bob is found to be guilty or negligent in this matter, should this material become part of this article.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website referenced “The New Zealand Cult List” <a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/c.php" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> for the “fraud” and “con-artist” accusations is not a valid reference. They don't cite any evidence or sources for their claims, except the Christianity Today article (which does not discuss his interest in money nor does it make any mention of Cornuke being “fraud” or a “con-artist” <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>), so these accusations can only be viewed as the opinion of an invalid source and not an objective or unbiased source of FACTS (which are required for encyclopedias AND this website). The sole purpose of this New Zealand Cults website seems to be to accuse others of malfeasance, so they are biased by their very nature and can’t be used here. Any and all references to this website should be removed and any content based on its material rephrased or removed to comply with the rules and regulations of this website.</p>
<p>5. If there are valid critical sources of Bob Cornuke, a 2nd category should be added called 'Skeptical Sites', instead of listing them all under ‘External Links’. This is used in Ron Wyatt's post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and is a much more neutral presentation of dissenting material, as long as it holds up to the criteria established by Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>6. The Link "Top 10 Reasons to be wary of Bob Cornuke" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/robertp_nz/no8wire/Bob_Cornuke_problems.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/robertp_nz/no8wire/Bob_Cornuke_problems.pdf" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> is full of problems, both in the assertions it contains and the material used as references. This is clearly an opinion piece and a direct attack on Bob’s character. The materials that are cited are full of holes, and they certainly do not meet the criteria established by Wikipedia for valid references <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Bob Cornuke's even being attacked for not having a good website, as if it somehow not having a good website actually holds any bearing on the merit of someone’s research or the quality of their character.</p>
<p>BASE institute is a very small, I mean, VERY small organization, with no permanent staff. BASE has no budget for a blockbuster website, and they rely on volunteers to assist with it. It's obvious Mr. Mander is digging for anything to smear Cornuke, even though Bob's only goal is to share his discoveries, and the discoveries of other adventurers <a href="http://www.jimandpenny.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jimandpenny.com/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, with people all around the world through his testimony.</p>
<p>Bob does not spend his time attacking other ministries or individuals and as official policy, does not give merit or dignity to spurious accusations by responding to them. Additionally, this document fails to uphold the described standards for a valid reference as established by Wikipedia (See Self-published sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>).</p>
<p>7. The post on pinkoski.com <a href="http://www.pinkoski.com/files/index.php?id=36" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pinkoski.com/files/index.php?id=36" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> is also rather problematic; Pinkoski goes on and on about how Bob and Larry never mention Wyatt, yet gives the references where Ron Wyatt is mentioned in Bob and Larry's book! Cornuke and Williams are out to promote the work THEY did and the things THEY found, not what Wyatt discovered or found. Also, Pinkoski makes reference to accusations that Larry Williams supposedly reported that Wyatt never actually found Jabal Al-Lawz, but the article cites no source or reference for this accusation. Pinkoski was also a curator of one of Wyatt's museums, so he's obviously a biased source against Cornuke and Williams and again should not be counted as a valid critic or reference (See Self-published sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>).</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to note that Cornuke and Williams prominently feature Jim and Penny Caldwell <a href="http://www.jimandpenny.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jimandpenny.com" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> on their video, Mountain of Fire – The Search for the True Mount Sinai (Dean River Productions, Copyright FHC LLC. © 2002 – <a href="http://www.baseinstitute.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baseinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). So it doesn’t seem that they are in the habit of taking all the glory or not giving credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>8. Assigning Bob Cornuke to the categories of "Fraudsters" and “Religious Scandals” is also spurious and without merit. These categorizations should be removed immediately. From the commentary above, these accusations have clearly been identified as without verifiable proof or merit and they fail to uphold the standards established by Wikipedia for valid references.</p>
<p>As an additional note, I notice that Ron Wyatt’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> post is much more benign and neutral in nature than Bob Cornuke’s, even though Wyatt has been the subject of the same kinds of criticism, if not more so, for his discoveries and research <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Even given this, Wyatt is NOT categorized similarly, under “Fraudsters” or “Religious Scandals” like Cornuke, even though Wyatt’s mentioned on the same New Zealand Cult List website <a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/w.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/w.php" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>! Clearly, this categorization of Bob as a fraud is not from an NPOV and should be removed immediately as it has no valid reference or basis in fact. Otherwise, this link should be added to Ron Wyatt’s article.</p>
<p>It seems clear that a Pro-Wyatt, Anti-Cornuke coalition has wrestled control of this post and it is time this article is brought back into reality and rewritten with verifiable facts and a neutral presentation that follows the rules and regulations of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Below is a revised post for review. Any comments and edits are more than welcome, but they must meet the rules and guidelines established by Wikipedia to be accepted. Thankfully, Wikipedia has established an arbitration committee if editors continue to taint the article or include invalid sources as references. --<a href="../../../s/y/i/User%7ESYITS_8ca7.html" title="User:SYITS">SYITS</a> 14:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This appears to be a brewing issue between one of Gastrich's heroes ("SYITS" is, almost certainly, a Gastrich sock, representing a "pro-Cornuke" perspective), arguing some sort of conspiratorial nonsense about some nebulous "anti-Cornuke" or "pro-Wyatt" group. Characteristically, Gastri...uh, SYITS, wants to lecture about the rules of Wikipedia, while white-washing, marginalizing, minimizing, and perhaps eliminating statements that are either controversial or those which he views as unflattering or controversial.</dd>

<dd>This is an encyclopedia. It's purpose is not to provide an unfettered platform for hero-worship. That means that articles about certain personalities and institutions are not always going to be flattering, and they are not intended to cast the person or institution in a flattering light, subject to approval and the subjective application of shifting standards by hero-worshippers. If there is controversy about an individual or institution, it gets reported, regardless of the resolution to the controversy, if, indeed, a resolution has been reached. It doesn't get whitewashed or minimized simply because someone doesn't happen to like it.</dd>

<dd>Compare the (admittedly flawed) article, as it stands, with the "proposed version," as it appears above. Notice some of the sly and not-so-sly POV pushing occurs. For example, the current article explains that the claims of Cornuke with respect to the "discovery" of "the anchors of Paul" is just that, i.e., a <i>claim</i>--nothing more. Gastrich, during his attempts to whitewash that fact, would remove it, and claim that he did so to maintain a more neutral POV. When I explained, above, why he was wrong, we heard no more about it, which is not unusual. Instead, we have another tried-and-true tactic. We have the creation of sock puppets, and new attempts, later on, to remove that simple little fact. Notice that there is no mention of that, at all, in the "revision" that is proposed above. Notice, also, that while some of the controversy is retained with respect to the conflict between Ron Wyatt and Cornuke, within their little "walled garden," it is minimized by the verbiage of the edited version above (along with the veiled threat of a call for arbitration, something Gastrich knows about all too well, having been banned for a year by a recent ArbCom decision).</dd>

<dd>It doesn't bother me to say that the phrase was put in to see what sort of reaction might occur. Gastrich claims that he doesn't read my commentary, though there's reason to doubt that, so such an obvious error would have gone unnoticed by him, or he would be forced into a situation in which he could not comment. It did, in fact, go unmentioned when "SYITS" first replied to the comments.

<p>The talk of the "famed" Costa Mesa SWAT team has been restored in the new article by "SYITS." Well, I was a cop for 11 years, also. I wasn't aware of any specific "fame" for the CMPD SWAT team any more than that of the LAPD SWAT team, the Denver SWAT team, or any other SWAT team.</p>
<p>Cornuke's experience as a crime scene investigator, such as it might be (and it is without confirmation by any independent source) does not really qualify him as any kind of scientific expert in the fields of archaeology or ancient history. It would appear that the citation of this "fact" takes advantage of the normal misunderstanding that most of us might have with respect to what CSI agents tend to do in the course of their duties. CSI agents for most departments (including Costa Mesa PD, if I recall correctly), are <i>civilians</i> , they are neither police officers nor specifically trained in the <i>interpretation</i> of evidence. They "process" crime scenes, gather evidence, run various laboratory tests, and only occasionally present conclusions. They <i>apply</i> scientific prinicples, but they do not "do science."</p>

<p>These points, and a few others, point to a writer whom has a stake in the article as he has presented it. I believe that the author is a Gastrich sock, given away by the edits, the style of writing, the veiled threats found in today's commentary as well as the first commentary on this page, and the concentration on a single, Gastrich-created and supported article in Wikipedia. If that is the case, it is interesting that, just a few weeks ago, Gastrich was telling us that he wouldn't participate in Wiki, any more, due to the alleged "unequal yoking" that occurs when one "cooperates" with "unbelievers."</p>

<p>I will certainly agree that the article needs a bit more work, as do most (maybe all) articles at Wikipedia, composed and edited, as they are, by non-professionals. But I don't think that whitewashing and marginalizing legitimate controversies is an improvement. I guess we'll see, particularly if much discussion of this article ensues. If I need to, I can go point-by-point through the comments of "SYITS," above, and show why most of them are groundless, baseless, rely in a biased reading of the article, or engage in attempts at whitewash. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 16:48, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll grant the possibility that SYITS is not a Gastrich sock, but I see more similarity than dissimilarity; and the dissimilarity would not be difficult to create. Certainly, a denial isn't going to be enough to be convincing, since there's so much of that similarity, including some of the presumptuousness that accompanied both the original edits and the proposed article, above; and Gastrich never was above engaging in deception. Time will tell, I think. Much will depends on the ability of SYITS to accept concensus and reasonable discussion with respect to the Cornuke article.</dd>

When I first read the article, I was suprised at how one-sided the material was and how terribly it represented Bob Cornuke and after studying about the concept of the site, I decided I should throw my hat into the ring and do my best to improve it.</dd>

Because of this, comments about the information that Wiki might possess are superficially useless. Still, there are admins watching and they have the authority to check on these things. If they find SYITS to be a legit non-Gastrich, I don't have a problem with that. The circumstances are suspicious enough, and the failure to understand nPOV even <i>now</i> are problems, in and of themselves; but I would never claim that those problems are limited to Gastrich. It is rather unusual for a new person to come in to Wikipedia and presume to lecture other users about what is and is not policy, what is and is not allowed, and what will and will not be edited, even to the point of warning that edits of which he disapproves or views negatively will be removed. SYITS has done this, and so has Gastrich. It is unusual behavior for a new editor. It's quite possible that SYITS is not a Gastrich puppet, but that just means that it's more likely that he's a "meatpuppet."</dd>

<dd>None of my comments about how the proposed article addresses the issues that are apparently of concern were addressed. The article is clearly biased in favor of Cornuke and my explanation as to how an encyclopedia should deal with controversial issues has not been rebutted. What this means is that, pending some sort of higher ruling, SYITS is certainly welcome to add appropriate information to the article, but he cannot whitewash it, as he has tried to do, already and as, suspiciously, it was tried before in almost the same ways.</dd>

<dd>The original article wasn't all that well-written. Later edits improved on that, but when edit warring commenced, the quality went down when trying to ensure that pertinent information remained. This means that the article could certainly stand improvement, but the removal or attempt at minimization information perceived as unflattering is not "improvement," it's whitewash. Let's remember what I wrote above with respect to what an encyclopedia is all about. My comments are not new information. They are not earth-shattering nor do they say anything new. Shucks, they're not even that well expressed; but they do the job. We're not here to write good things about Bob Cornuke. If he's going to have an article in Wikipedia, we're here to write the <i>facts</i> about him, whatever they may be. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 04:03, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'll say it, again: Encyclopedias exist to provide <i>information</i>. That information is to be as unbiased and neutral in POV as possible (given that it's human beings that do the writing). If the subject or personality is controversial in any way, the responsibility of the encyclopedia is to report <i>that</i>, as well as the <i>why</i> of the controversy. Cornuke's archaeological reputation, such as it is, exists within a specific kind of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> in the Christian community (what reputation that might exist outside of that walled garden, I've discovered, is that he's something of an amateur, at best...a charlatan, at worst), but he is controversial, even there. If there is to be an article about him, at all, it must include the information about that controversy and why there is controversy. It must do that without trying to excuse, minimize, or whitewash the controversy or provide convoluted excuses as to why reasonable sources should be excluded. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 14:51, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Zealand Cult Watch Cannot be Referenced</span></h2>
<p>Refutation of New Zealand Cult List as a source:</p>
<p>The cited source used in the current article <i><a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cults.co.nz/index.php</a></i> is an invalid source and cannot be used as a cited reference on this website.</p>
<p>Below are seven reasons, with highlights taken from Wikipedia's documentation, that outline exactly why this cannot be used as a source.</p>
<p><b>Reliable Source [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>]</b></p>
<p>1. <i>"...A primary source provides direct evidence for a certain state of affairs. This may mean that the source observes a state of affairs directly, or that they observe indirect evidence of it. In other words, a primary source is a source very close to the original state of affairs you are writing about. An example of primary-source material would be a photograph of a car accident taken by an eye witness, or a report from that eye witness. A trial transcript is also primary-source material. Wikipedia articles may rely on primary sources so long as what they say has been published by a credible publication. For example, a trial transcript that has been published by the court. We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a credible publication. See Wikipedia:No original research. "</i></p>
<p>This website does not qualify as a primary source for any of the information it contains. It is not a credible publication or source of news. It therefore cannot be used.</p>
<p><br />
2. <i>"...Do they have an agenda or conflict of interest, strong views, or other bias which may color their report? Remember that conflicts of interest are not always explicitly exposed and bias is not always self-evident. However, that a source has strong views is not necessarily a reason not to use it, although editors should avoid using political groups with widely acknowledged extremist views, like Stormfront.org or the Socialist Workers Party. Groups like these may be used as primary sources only as sources about themselves, and even then with caution and sparingly, or about their viewpoints."</i></p>
<p>It is evident that this is a strongly biased website, based on the views of one man, it's editor, Ian Mander [<a href="http://www.cults.co.nz/about.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cults.co.nz/about.php" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>], who holds extreme views on many subjects. It therefore cannot be used.</p>
<p><br />
3. <i>"<b>Partisan Website</b></i></p>
<p>...Claims which strongly support one or another party in an ongoing dispute (see e.g. Wikipedia:List of controversial issues). "</p>
<p>This reference in this post clearly weighs the article in support of those with a negative view of Bob Cornuke. It therefore cannot be used.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Verifiability [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>]</b></p>
<p>4. This is the Opening sentence of the policy:</p>
<p><i>"One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers."</i></p>
<p>There are no sources cited for any of the accusations contained in this website, except the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_Today_de6e.html" title="Christianity Today">Christianity Today</a> article, which never refers to Cornuke as a "fraud" or a "con artist". Therefore the quotes "fraud" and "con artist" cannot be used because they are not cited, except as the opinion of the site's editor. Therefore, this link cannot be used AND the terms "fraud" and "con-artist" CANNOT BE USED.</p>
<p><br />
5. Because of the removal of the quotes identifying him as such, Cornuke must also be removed from the category of "Fraudsters" as no credible cited source makes this assertion.</p>
<p><br />
6. This phrase of the current post:</p>
<p><i>"for the anchors from the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Paul_097e.html" title="Apostle Paul">Apostle Paul</a>’s ship wreck (in the Bible: <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Acts_3533.html" title="Book of Acts">Book of Acts</a>, chapter 27), which he claims to have found<a href="http://www.khouse.org/articles/2004/503/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.khouse.org/articles/2004/503/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, but others deny<a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/119/42.0.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>."</i></p>
<p>The source never denies that Cornuke found the anchors, so another source will have to be cited to make this claim.</p>
<p><br />
The current article has been modified, keeping as much of the original material as possible, but removing any and all references from or to this New Zealand Cults List website. Anyone wishing to include this source must first prove that this is a worthwhile and necessary source for this article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>].</p>
<p>Another quote from the Verifiability Policty:</p>
<p>7. <i>"<b>Burden of evidence</b></i></p>
<p>...The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references."</p>
<p>I have laid out my proof above (as I did previously) and no one has been able to prove otherwise that this link and reference should remain. Therefore, the burden of proof is now upon whomever wishes to include a reference to this New Zealand Cults website.</p>

<li><i>It's a real stretch to call a website produced by one dude a "dictionary". It doesn't come close to that definition! Read the about page for this site, it's edited by one guy, Ian Mander. There are no sources or references for any of the material, so it's his opinion, nothing more. Who says it's "Trustworthy"? You??? Who cares!! Name one other website that would use this as a "trustworthy" source and maybe we'll have a debate, but it clearly fails many rules established by wiki as a referenceable web site.

<dd>Actually, this was a poorly-crafted argument. Quoting sections and then doing nothing more than virtually pointing and saying, "see!?" does not make an argument for exclusion. I was especially amused by the statement, "this reference in this post clearly weighs the article in support of those with a negative view of Bob Cornuke. It therefore cannot be used." Ssssoooo...because it cast Cornuke in a negative light, it is not to be used? There's nothing quite like making it very clear that one possesses a POV that is, for all worths and purposes, non-negotiable, and "SYITS" has done that with that statement, alone. He needs to stay far away from this article. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 14:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No other source makes these claims (gee, I wonder why, they aren't TRUE and no CREDIBLE news source would ever print such slander). So, the only purpose of this article is to skew the article to a negative perception of Bob. If offers no original source material or insight(as it's ONLY source on Bob Cornuke is the Christianity Today article, which already used extensively throughout the article).

I've already exposed the holes in the previous arguments, and there was no reply. The subsequent arguments were substanceless. There was very little to them. Finally, the complaints that the article exists only to "slander Bob Cornuke" (a serious charge, by the way, for which there is no justification) again exposes the POV of this "SYITS" character. Of course, the article was originally a bunch of cruft--nothing more than hero worship. I've already addressed that. Wikipedia doesn't exist for that purpose. We present the facts. If someone is uncomfortable with the facts, that's not a problem for us or for Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 02:07, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[indent] To add to arbustoo's comments, your logic works if he got a Ph.D. from an accredited university. However looking at the LBU requirements for a Ph.D. there is no mention of requiring an undergraduate degree. All that i could find is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The admission requirements for both the undergraduate and graduate programs are based upon the criteria of the institution. Admission is further based on individual approval of the Admissions Office."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So what are the <i><b>criteria of the instituion</b></i>?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>It is expected that the successful applicant for admission will have attained an appropriate educational level and will have demonstrated professional competence (or such potential) at a level which would prepare him/her for the academic program for which they are applying." <a href="http://www.lbu.edu/macadmissions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lbu.edu/macadmissions.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So what are the <i><b>appropriate educational level</b></i> of the instituion? All i could find were the following four areas that they review for entrance to LBU. <a href="http://www.lbu.edu/macacademicinfo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lbu.edu/macacademicinfo.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>To receive an evaluation of your previous formal studies as well as nontraditional learning experiences, simply forward the documents listed below:"</i></dd>
<dd>"<i>1. Transcripts of all prior formal education at the postsecondary level."</i></dd>
<dd>"<i>2. A schedule of self-study courses, seminars, workshops, and other informal education."</i></dd>
<dd>"<i>3. A detailed resume of life experiences."</i></dd>
<dd>"<i>4. At least three references."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So it seems there is no strict requirement for an undergraduate degree especially since they consider life experience. My guess is that being a legendary member of a SWAT team could be enough for a successful application. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 23:21, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is a fine example of why schools that fail to meet minimum educational requirements should not be allowed to award anything with the words: bachelors, degree, masters or doctorate.

<p>It simply isn't relevant, all the source saying is that it is vaguely possible that they might be anchors from the right time period. To pretend that that constitues useful or notable evidence is ridiculous. Its like if someone claimed to have found <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Kidd_8c03.html" title="Captain Kidd">Captain Kidd</a>'s treasure and claimed as major evidence that someone had confirmed that what I had found might be a pit that might have been dug in the right time period. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:59, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is relevant because of the statement that was there prior that said there was no independent or scientific confirmation of his discovery, which this statement refutes. The Prof. independently verified that 1) Ancient anchors were found by Bob in Malta 2) that these anchors were of the time of Paul 3) these anchors were of the size and nature used by Rome for the grain vessel Paul and the others were aboard. There is nothing left of the boat, as the wood would have rotted away long ago, and anchors would be all that could survice. In the book, Cornuke lays out a very good case for the location these anchors were found being the exact spot described in Acts 27 where the shipwreck occurred. So, Cornuke finds anchors in the very spot he believes the Bible describes and gets independent confirmation from a scientist who knows the era like no other that these anchors were of the correct time period and from the right kind of ship to match the Biblical account. That's as much scientific and independent confirmation as could possibly be found for this kind of discovery, so his confirmation is not trivial or irrelevant. However, at stake is not the claim of finding the anchors, but to debunk the statement that no independent or scientific verification exists for the claim. --<a href="../../../s/y/i/User%7ESYITS_8ca7.html" title="User:SYITS">SYITS</a> 16:25, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A little knowledge of marine archaelogy can go a long way. Anchors, anchor stones and other marine artifacts are found throughout the Medditeranean. They are very common. And it would be almost impossible to tell anchors from the year 60 with stones from 20 or 100. Considering how common such artifacts are, its ridiculous to cite that as "scientific confirmation" (and incidentally, wood from shipwrecks actually can last quite a long time under the proper marine conditions). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:29, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, so there's no way to trace a specific ship to a specific piece of wreckage, so the only "confirmation" possible is is that the anchors were of the right kind to be used on a ship as decribed in Acts 27 and of the right time period. Bob lays out the case for their location. Again, the book provides a detailed case that these could be the anchors of Paul, but there's obviously no way to prove it for sure. Please read the book before dismissing it completely and referencing what he "claims" to have found or not, it really is quite compelling. --<a href="../../../s/y/i/User%7ESYITS_8ca7.html" title="User:SYITS">SYITS</a> 16:37, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just so we all understand: The only people who really believe that the objects found are the anchors used by the ship, <i>allegedly</i> on which Paul was a passenger, as related to the story in Acts (which is, itself, a collection of unverified and unverifiable accounts), are those who <i>want</i> to believe it, so the Gastrich clone simply exposes, once again, that his/her view and the edits that are derived from that view are strongly non-nPOV. I'm not going to argue standards of evidence and science against someone whom clearly doesn't understand either of these things. It's a complete waste of my increasingly valuable time (and I can't help but wonder how a "legendary" police officer and former CSI could fail to understand, either, but that's another argument). Personally, I could care less, either way, about Cornuke, personally. What interests me is the unfettered, unadulterated truth, whereever it may lead. The fact is that the discovery of the anchors is a <i>claim</i> made by Cornuke and his fans, and that <i>claim</i> is disputed. Another fact is that there is no independent, objective, verifiable concensus within the scientific community, and nothing in the professional literature supporting the <i>claim</i>. It is, therefore, a <i>claim</i> that remains unverified and it's perfectly reasonable to point that out. Any attempt to remove that exposes the POV of the editor in question (in this case, the Gastrich clone, SYITS) and constitutes an attempt at whitewash. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 20:32, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to take a guess and say this particular claim can probably be backed up, although I've added a "citation needed" tag to that portion. It seems, however, that you're wasting an unbelievable amount of energy trying to ensure that every claim in this article meets objection. One has only to read the first paragraph to understand that Bob Cornuke is not the most respected individual in his field.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, for my standards I think the entire field is bogus, but then again, I believe there is ample evidence that many of these Old Testement stories are derived from legends that the Ancient Hebrews borrowed from the ancient peoples of Mesopotamea. But it's not my job to go around countering every biblical scholars' claims on wikipedia with facts in an attempt to create an indictment rather than a biography.</dd>
<dd>It's entirely obvious that Cornuke's appearances have been for self-promotion, and for myself, I don't question that he has been featured on any of those. I, personally, don't believe we need a citation. I don't think one enters the field of Biblical Archeology with the intent of helping starving children in Africa or curing SARS, or to prevent global warming. But the man has certainly made his name in the world and I don't doubt that someone will find the information behind the claim.</dd>

<dd>I understand your point but if POV puchers are going to white wash the articles then they have to be patrolled.

<p>Someone, who I believe to be connected to Cornuke if not Cornuke himself, added in: "Bob Cornuke is not the only researcher who believes that the real Mt. Sinai might be Jabal al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia. Among other prominent researchers who also believe this are Frank Moore Cross, Professor Emeritus, Harvard University..."</p>
<p>Not only should a long list of other "prominent researchers" not be used to back up a general claim (it is Cornuke's evidence that is dispelled in the article) this is list is incorrect and deceitful. For example, Frank Moore Cross is a Harvard <b>Divinity</b> professor of <b>languages</b> not a history or archaeology nor even a professor at the actual Harvard UNIVERSITY.<a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/faculty/em/cross.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/faculty/em/cross.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></p>
<p>Not only that, but "In an interview with Hershel Shanks, Prof. <b>Frank Moore Cross</b>, retired professor of Hebrew at Harvard University opines that the mountain of God was located in the Land of Midian. When asked if he had a guess what mountain might be Mt. Sinai, he responded, "<b>I really don't. There are several enormous mountains in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia.</b> Jebel el-Lawz is the highest of the mountain in Midian ­ 8,465 feet ­ higher than any mountain in the Sinai Peninsula; but biblical Mt. Sinai need not be the highest mountain. There is some reason to search for it in southern Edom, which was Midianite terrain before the expansion of the Edomites south" (Shanks 1992:32). <b>He later put the "Midian Hypothesis" in print, but did not endorse any mountains for the location of Mt.

<dd>So one can see that 1 scholar mentioned said nothing in the source cited about it (Moller), another doesn't believe any suggestion fits historically with the story (Knuteson), and the last one says it is the "most convincing" (Kerkeslager). Syits wasn't being honest with these quotes and didn't expect people to read them. Cornukechecker 10:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Syits lied and misrepresented quotes again. He added quotes from James Mulholland, which appear to contradict Franz, but when you read the source provided<a href="http://www.ldolphin.org/maltashipwreck.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ldolphin.org/maltashipwreck.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> (Mullholland's comments are at the very bottom) you see Mullholland agrees with Franz that <i>Cornuke was wrong.</i> In fact Mullholland notes, "Of course, we could pick each element of Mr. Cornuke's overall theory and propose other locations that could possibly match that single element. However, that's not the appropriate exercise here. The compelling nature of Mr. Cornuke's theory rests in the fact that ALL of the elements come together in one location. <i>I could show you a place on the western side of the island where they possibly meet.</i> However, that means nothing, because the depth structure on the western side of the island doesn't match the Biblical record." --Cornukechecker 20:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>His official biography does not mention any accredited or any expertise in history or archeology.<a href="http://www.baseinstitute.org/bob.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baseinstitute.org/bob.html" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> Since he and no other source makes the claim one can conclude he has no academic training in any field. Thus, this needs to be included with him making such controversial claims on supposed "discoveries." --Cornukechecker 21:29, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is a negative assumption and is not logically sound.

<dd>Adding false material and excluding important details violates NPOV. The opening paragraph reads: "He is a former police officer and present-day Biblical <b>archaeology</b> explorer and the author of six books on biblical history relating to archaeological explorations. He has no formal training in <b>archaeology</b> or any accredited higher education degrees."</dd>

<dd>It is important so peopel don't confuse his claims without some you does real academic archaeology. --Cornukechecker 21:58, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His lack of education in the field of archeology is important to a discussion on Cornuke's archeology "discoveries." Got a source that he has ANY credentials? It is important to note so peopel don't confuse Cornuke with an actual archeologist. --Cornukechecker 21:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Education, or lack thereof, does not negate the EVIDENCE of his various finds. All of the other scholars I cited were independent refernces that all make the claim that Jabal Al-Lawz is Mt. Sinai, these did not come from Cornuke. Do not remove these just because you don't like them. Also, his lack of eduction is discussed on the post and there is no reason to place this statement in the opening article other than to make an indictment, which is not what this site is all about. I will continue to remove this statement as it's only intent is to tilt the perception of the topic. --<a href="../../../s/y/i/User%7ESYITS_8ca7.html" title="User:SYITS">SYITS</a> 22:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't PROVE something DIDN'T happen. He has no credentials and is not an archaeologist. If you want to claim he has credentials then support it. An unaccredited degree tied to his business partner is BS. He has no credentials and it will be in there. Especially with the recent news<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50857" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50857" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> trying to pass him off as legit. Lacking degrees is important to put in the lead as others agree. --Cornukechecker 23:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The opening paragraph mentions archaeology three times and thus, it is important to note he makes no claims for any credentials in history or related fields. --Cornukechecker 05:30, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current revision, which mentions his lack of formal training or education, but also mentions years of experience on expeditions, seems to me to strike a fair balance. Readers should be able to evaluate the relative merits of education vs. experience (without necessarily all reaching the same conclusion). <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 16:44, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
