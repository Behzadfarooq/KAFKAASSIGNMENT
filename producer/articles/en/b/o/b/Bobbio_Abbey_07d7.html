<p>The background to the foundation of the abbey was the <a href="../../../l/o/m/Lombards.html" title="Lombards">Lombard</a> invasion of Italy in 568. The Lombard king <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agilulf.html" title="Agilulf">Agilulf</a> married the devout <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodelinda.html" title="Theodelinda">Theodelinda</a> in 590 and under her influence and that of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> missionary Columbanus, he was persuaded to accept conversion to Catholicism. As a base for the conversion of the Lombard people Agilulf gave Columbanus a ruined church and wasted lands known as Ebovium, which, before the Lombards seized them, had formed part of the lands of the papacy. Columbanus particularly wanted this secluded place, for while enthusiastic in the instruction of the Lombards he preferred solitude for his monks and himself. Next to this little church, which was dedicated to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Peter_04db.html" title="Simon Peter">Saint Peter</a>, a monastery was soon built. The abbey at its foundation followed the <b>Rule of St. Columbanus</b>, based on the monastic practices of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Christianity_3a66.html" title="Celtic Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a>.</p>
<p><a name="7th_century:_Arianism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbio_Abbey_07d7.html" title="Edit section: 7th century: Arianism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">7th century: Arianism</span></h2>
<p>Saint Columbanus was buried on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">23 November</a> <a href="../../../6/1/5/615.html" title="615">615</a>, but was followed by successors of high calibre in Saints <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Attala_1f8a.html" title="Saint Attala">Attala</a> (d. 627) and Bertulf (d. 640), who steered the new monastery through the dangers of militant Arianism under King <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotharis.html" title="Rotharis">Rotharis</a> (636–652). Bobbio was much involved in the tradition concerning Rotharis' immediate predecessor, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arioald.html" title="Arioald">Arioald</a>, who became a Catholic after having Saint Bladulf, a monk of Bobbio, assassinated, because Bladulf refused to salute him, as an Arian. The story goes that Attala restored Bladulf to life and delivered Arioald from a diabolical possession, the punishment of his crime; and that this double miracle led to Arioald's conversion.</p>
<p>In 628, when Saint Bertulf made a pilgrimage to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Honorius_I_2690.html" title="Pope Honorius I">Pope Honorius I</a> exempted Bobbio from episcopal jurisdiction, thus making the abbey immediately subject to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>. Under the next abbot, Bobolen, the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_St._Benedict_a17f.html" title="Rule of St. Benedict">Rule of St. Benedict</a> was introduced. At first its observance was optional, but in the course of time it superseded the harsher Rule of St. Columbanus, and Bobbio joined the Congregation of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Cassino_3751.html" title="Monte Cassino">Monte Cassino</a>. In 643, at the request of Rotharis and Queen Gundelberga, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Theodore_I_aa44.html" title="Pope Theodore I">Pope Theodore I</a> granted to the Abbot of Bobbio the use of the mitre and other pontificals.</p>
<p>During the turbulent 7th century Bobbio succeeded in remaining a centre of Catholic belief and culture. Through the efforts of Saint Columbanus's disciples, increasing numbers of the Lombards were received into the Roman Catholic church. But during the first half of the 7th century, the large tract of country lying between <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verona.html" title="Verona">Verona</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>, was in a very irreligious and disturbed state; even idolatry was not unknown. In fact, not until the reign of the usurper <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoald_I_of_Benevento_ee3a.html" title="Grimoald I of Benevento">Grimoald I</a> (663–673), himself a convert, did the bulk of the nation accept Catholicism. But after this point Arianism rapidly disappeared in the West.</p>
<p>The prominent part which the abbey took in the final contest with the Arian heresy is generally regarded as the most significant part of its history.</p>

<p>Theodelinda's nephew <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aripert_I_0e4f.html" title="Aripert I">Aripert I</a> (653–663) restored all the lands of Bobbio which belonged by right to the pope. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aripert_II_86eb.html" title="Aripert II">Aripert II</a> confirmed this restitution to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_VII_1079.html" title="Pope John VII">Pope John VII</a> in 707. The Lombards soon dispossessed the popes again, but in 756 <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aistulf.html" title="Aistulf">Aistulf</a> was compelled by <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepin_the_Younger_7511.html" title="Pepin the Younger">Pepin the Younger</a> to give up the lands. In 774 <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> made liberal grants to the abbey. In 1153 <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Barbarossa_8d47.html" title="Frederick Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a> confirmed by two charters various rights and possessions.</p>
<p>The fame of Bobbio reached the shores of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and Columbanus' reputation attracted many more Irish religious. Bobolen's successor was Saint <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comgall.html" title="Comgall">Comgall</a> who had resigned his see in Ireland in order to become a monk of Bobbio. Saint <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cummian.html" title="Cummian">Cummian</a> who did the same died in the abbey about 730.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbio_Abbey_07d7.html" title="Edit section: Library">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Library</span></h2>
<p>The nucleus of what was to be the most celebrated library in Italy was formed by the manuscripts which Columbanus had brought from Ireland and the treatises which he wrote himself. The learned <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Dungal_e07d.html" title="Saint Dungal">Saint Dungal</a> (d. after 827) bequeathed to the abbey his valuable library, consisting of some seventy volumes, among which was the famous "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiphonary_of_Bangor_dbe3.html" title="Antiphonary of Bangor">Antiphonary of Bangor</a>".</p>
<p>A tenth-century catalogue, published by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Muratori.html" title="Muratori">Muratori</a>, shows that at that period every branch of knowledge, divine and human, was represented in this library. Many of the books have been lost, the rest have long since been dispersed and are still reckoned among the chief treasures of the later collections which possess them.</p>
<p>In 1616 Cardinal <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federigo_Borromeo_b998.html" title="Federigo Borromeo">Federigo Borromeo</a> took for the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrosian_Library_3a77.html" title="Ambrosian Library">Ambrosian Library</a> of Milan eighty-six volumes, including the famous "Bobbio Missal", written about 911, the Antiphonary of Bangor, and the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palimpsest.html" title="Palimpsest">palimpsests</a> of <a href="../../../u/l/f/Ulfilas.html" title="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a>' <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_language.html" title="Gothic language">Gothic</a> version of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. Twenty-six volumes were given, in 1618, to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_V_d589.html" title="Pope Paul V">Pope Paul V</a> for the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_Library_f5d6.html" title="Vatican Library">Vatican Library</a>. Many others were sent to Turin, where, besides those in the Royal Archives, there were seventy-one in the University Library until the disastrous fire of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>.</p>
<p>As scholars of later ages have owed a great deal to the Bobbio manuscripts, so, too, did those of the tenth century. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerbert_of_Aurillac_15f2.html" title="Gerbert of Aurillac">Gerbert of Aurillac</a>, for example (afterwards <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Sylvester_II_af75.html" title="Pope Sylvester II">Pope Sylvester II</a>), became abbot of Bobbio in 982; and with the aid of the numerous ancient treatises which he found there he composed his celebrated work on geometry. It appears that at a time when Greek was almost unknown in western Europe, the Irish monks of Bobbio read <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demosthenes.html" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> in the original tongue.</p>

<p>In 1014, the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_f235.html" title="Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Henry II</a>, on the occasion of his own coronation in Rome, obtained from <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_VIII_f0c8.html" title="Pope Benedict VIII">Pope Benedict VIII</a> the erection of Bobbio as an episcopal see. Peter Aldus, its first bishop, had been abbot of Bobbio since 999, and his episcopal successors for a long time lived in the abbey, where many of them had been monks. From either 1133 or 1161 Bobbio was a suffragan see of Genoa. From time to time disputes arose between the bishop and the monks, and in 1199 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Innocent_III_0910.html" title="Pope Innocent III">Pope Innocent III</a> issued two bulls, restoring the abbey in spirituals and temporals, and empowering the bishop to depose an abbot if within a certain time he did not obey.</p>
<p>Among the bishops of Bobbio have been Blessed Albert (1184), who was translated to the Patriarchal See of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and died a martyr at <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">Acre</a> in 1214; the learned canonist Giovanni de Mondani (1477-82), whose remains were found incorrupt in 1614; and Antonio Gianelli (1838–46), who was canonized by Pope Pius XII on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>.</p>

<p>Saint Columbanus' abbey and church were taken from the Benedictines by the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> occupying forces in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1803.html" title="1803">1803</a>, when the abbey was suppressed. What remains of it is now used as a municipal school, and the church, where the relics of Saints Columbanus, Attala, Bertulf, Cummian, and others are housed, is now a parish church, served by secular priests.</p>
