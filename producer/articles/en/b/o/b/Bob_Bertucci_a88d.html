	    <p><b>Bob Bertucci</b> (born [[September] <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>) is an American former <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a> player <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_College_bc94.html" title="Springfield College">Springfield College</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> and is the current <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a> coach of the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_University_c9fe.html" title="Temple University">Temple University</a> Owls of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_10_Conference_7c30.html" title="Atlantic 10 Conference">Atlantic 10 Conference</a>. Bertucci, in his 12th year as the coach of the Owls, is the winningest volleyball coach in Temple volleyball history. However, he has not led his squad to an Atlantic 10 title nor an NCAA appearance since 2002 when the Owls made it to the Sweet Sixteen suffering a crushing 3-0 defeat to the Florida Gators, which is led by Hall of Fame and AVCA member Mary Wise. Bertucci is not just a volleyball coach; however, he is a master manipulator who terrorizes rather than touches every one of his players' lives in some form. Many of his players were and still are seeking counseling for Bertucci's antics on and off the court. Basically, he is a spineless jellyfish who kisses his superiors' behinds. He is known for his various NCAA rule violations, bad recruiting, verbal and psychological abuse to players, and obscure catchphrases, such as, "You're covered in dumba**." If a poll were to be taken on if he is liked by his players, at least 95% of them would say he is the devil come to life. He also does not even do the true job of a head coach since he comes into work for the sole reason of getting away from his large family and to work out with the hopes of losing obscene amounts of weights in obscene amounts of time. He gets his kicks by picking on the same few players day in and day out, not to mention keeping his players past practice time. He is famous for poor planning and inconsideration for others' needs.</p>

<p>Bertucci made his coaching debut at West Point, and then he went on to coach at University of Tennessee and Rutgers before he came to Temple. Rumor has it that he had inappropriate relations with several of his Tennessee players, which led to his resignation. Of course, this was all covered up as everything is in college athletics, so the truth to this rumor is unknown. He has been named Coach of the Year on several occasions in the various conferences in which he coached, but his teams were only successful because of the players and the assistant coaching staff he had.</p>

<p>In addition to the many conference championships won by Bertucci's teams, Bertucci himself<br />
was named an All-American in the USA Volleyball championships in 2002 in the<br />
40-and-over division. Twelve years before that, Bertucci shared in is biggest<br />
accomplishment when his Rutgers men's team went to the Final Four in 1990. When Rutgers<br />
got rid of their men's program, Bertucci returned to coaching the women's game when he<br />
took the job at Temple. Rutgers lost a program, and Temple gained a nightmare.</p>
