<li>Expand treatment of Fischer's career for the years 1970-1972 (<i>rationale: these are the special years in Fischer's career--he may have been #1 in the world as early as 1967, but it was by no means clear that he would win world championship. As early as Rovinj-Zagreb, however, it was clear that Fischer had made a quantum leap in strength and was far ahead of the top Soviet players....</i>)</li>

<dd>I suggest Robert Byrne v. Fischer, U.S. Championship 1963 <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008419" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008419" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In Fischer's "My 60 Memorable Games" Evans notes that the commentator in the analysis room was explaining how Fischer had misplayed things and was probably lost when the word came: Byrne had resigned.</dd>
<dd>And probably also Donald Byrne v. Fischer, Rosenwald Memorial 1956 <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008361&amp;kpage=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008361&amp;kpage=20" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, called by some "The Game of the Century" though that is easily disputed.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBobby_Fischer_1a65.html" title="Edit section: No, not the first U.S. World Chess Champion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">No, not the first U.S. World Chess Champion</span></h2>
<p>The article begins:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (born March 9, 1943) is a grandmaster and former world chess champion, who on September 1, 1972, became the first and only American chess player to win the World Chess Championship.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is incorrect. William (nee Wilhelm) <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Steinitz_a8c8.html" title="William Steinitz">Steinitz</a> became a U.S. citizen in 1888, after both his matches with Zuckertort (1872 and 1886; it is still disputed which one made him "World Champion") and before his matches with Chigorin, Gunsberg and Lasker. The second match with Zuckertort was played in the USA. While one might quibble that Steinitz did not first "win the championship" as an American, I am adjusting the opening to "American-born". -Wfaxon 19:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On 4 August 2006 at 14:26 user "62.40.76.253" correctly corrected us as to "American" vs. "US". I wasn't forgetting Capablanca but still, "American" as a nationality only refers to one place. -Wfaxon 16:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current introduction is misleading for the casual reader. Both Morphy and Steinitz are listed in Wikipedia in the article on world champions and have a US flag by their name. How about "Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (born 9 March 1943) is a United States-born chess Grandmaster and in 1972 became the first non-Soviet chessplayer to win the World Chess Championship since 1948." or "Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (born 9 March 1943) is a United States-born chess Grandmaster and in 1972 became the first US-born chessplayer to win the FIDE World Chess Championship." Rjm at sleepers 07:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fischer's comments on 9/11 are already mentioned in detail in this article, excessively, in my opinion. This is not the forum for a POV regarding Fischer's mental state or speculations about someone's religious background or ethnicity. Ditto for your geocities source regarding Fischer's alleged profanity. Your posts are unprofessional, completely out of place in an encyclopedia.

<dd>The mp3 is there for you to listen to. You can link to it via a page recommended by Fischer himself.

<dd>Re <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Nemenyi_874d.html" title="Paul Nemenyi">Paul Nemenyi</a>: just as Fischer denies the historicity of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, his defenders can deny that Nemenyi and Regina Wender Fischer appeared to believe that RJF was Nemenyi's biological son. Was he? I dunno. But perception can be reality in such things. Did RJF <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_in_the_Glass_Booth_1e87.html" title="The Man in the Glass Booth">believe he was Jewish</a>? That would explain a lot. Did you know that the WWCOG saw themselves as British Israelites (i.e., chosen people who weren't Jewish?) And there's that strange change-of-name to "Robert D. James" in the Pasadena <s>Court</s>Jailhouse years....

<dd>Finally, many of us of a certain age have a great reservoir of empathy for Fischer the human being. I am glad that he has the opportunity to live a comfortable retirement in Iceland, and wish him well. However...we are all accountable for our words.

<dl>
<dd>Yet another postscript: I had to restore the fact that Regina Wender was of Jewish ancestry (I have seen references to her as a Polish Jew, but she was definitely a cultural German, &amp; borders were in flux...). Nowhere in the article is it suggested that RWF was observant--indeed, that would be rather unlikely given her personal history. (Fischer has even claimed to be uncircumcised.) Is RWF's ancestry now a disputed fact? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 03:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's the crucial passage from the Inquirer article, which Edmonds &amp; Eidinow find credible:
<dl>
<dd><i>Agents made it their business to find out who Fischer's father was. They checked his birth certificate; it listed his father as Gerhardt Fischer. He and Regina Wender had married in Moscow in 1933.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>They divorced in 1945, two years after Bobby's birth, but the FBI believed they had been apart longer than that. Regina Fischer came here in 1939; the FBI said her husband never entered the United States.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI file says Gerhardt Fischer lived for a time in Chile, where he sold fluorescent lights and worked as a photographer.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI suspected he might have been a Soviet spy there in World War II, targeting Nazis. The evidence? In a letter to Regina Fischer, he had made what the FBI called a "cryptic" reference to photographing fishermen at a Chilean port.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The file noted that several German agents had been arrested there, posing as fishermen.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI seemed to pay more attention to Regina Fischer's Hungarian friend, Paul Nemenyi.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nemenyi came to the United States in the 1930s, taught college mathematics, and met Regina Fischer in 1942, according to the files. An informant told the bureau that in 1947, Nemenyi opined that the Soviet system was "superior to that of the U.S."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nemenyi also took a deep interest in Bobby Fischer. He paid child support and complained to social workers about the way Regina was raising the boy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A social worker told the FBI of interviewing Nemenyi in 1948. This informant dutifully reported that as they spoke about Regina, Nemenyi had wept.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The heavily censored files don't say whether Nemenyi was Fischer's father. Letters obtained by The Inquirer offer an answer. They are the papers of Nemenyi's late son <a href="http://www.crmvet.org/mem/nemenyi.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.crmvet.org/mem/nemenyi.htm" rel="nofollow">Peter</a>, a civil-rights activist who gave them to a state archive in Wisconsin.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I take it you know that Paul was Bobby Fischer's father," Peter Nemenyi wrote after his father's death in 1952. The papers also include a plaintive letter that same year from Regina Fischer to Peter Nemenyi.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Bobby... was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question," she wrote. "I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the end, that's the picture the FBI was left with: nothing more than a worried single mother with a troubled son.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not claim this evidence is conclusive, but I certainly find it compelling, as did two reporters and the editors of a major newspaper, as did two authors and their publisher. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 05:30, 3 September 2006 (UTC); link to Nemyeni bio added <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 02:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is getting silly. My point was that the focus of this encyclopedia article should be on Fischer's achievements as a chess player. That is why Fischer is famous. Fischer has commented publicly on baseball, and expressed opinions regarding Ichiro Suzuki breaking the major league hits record a few years ago. Should these Fischer statements be included in the Wikipedia article? Was Thomas Edison a Democrat? Should this be included in the Edison article? Maybe, farther down, briefly. From reading Mr. Brock's previous posts, I have learned that he was president of the Illinois Chess Association, and an accomplished chess player in his own right. Shouldn't the focus of the Fischer article be on Fischer the chess player? <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronCBurke_b9e8.html" title="User:AaronCBurke">AaronCBurke</a> 05:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fischer himself has turned the attention elsewhere in his numerous <b>broadcast</b> statements which he <b>continues to disseminate via his website</b>: per his most recent interview, he not only hates Americans and Jews, he also hates chess. But of course Fischer was once a chess player first, and I too would like to remember him as that, not as the self-hating American &amp; self-hating Jew he's become.... I accept the primacy of focus argument (in fact, I long ago noted in the "to do" section that 1970-72 section of his career was underrepresented, and I feel that the WWCOG section is a bit long). But don't use the primacy of focus argument to dodge unpleasant facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Should the article be split? Probably. How? I don't know.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 06:10, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Was <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> a Democrat?" Funny example to choose...I dunno, but I too would probably consider it NN in the context of a WP article. Was Edison an antisemite? Yes, and his biographers deal with it, but because he kept it to himself, it doesn't merit the same attention that it would in an article about Edison's friend <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>. But in his public broadcasts since January 13, 1999, Fischer has made it clear that "self-hating Jew" is now his full-time occupation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the same time, I say this without malice (it is my personal belief that RJF is not fully accountable for his actions), and wish him a peaceful and happy life in Iceland. <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044340" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044340" rel="nofollow">Fischer-Unzicker, Siegen 1970</a>: now that's chess! <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 06:32, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This encyclopedia article needs to focus more on Fischer the chess player, because chess is what Fischer is best known for. For example, the encyclopedia article about Paul Morphy focuses on his chess career first, his eccentricities later on.<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronCBurke_b9e8.html" title="User:AaronCBurke">AaronCBurke</a> 17:28, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that my characterization of Fischer's interview re 9/11 as "virulent" speech may be seen as non-NPOV by those who haven't bothered to listen to the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_b/mp3/F_19_1.MP3" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_b/mp3/F_19_1.MP3" rel="nofollow">mp3 rant</a>. But I'm curious as to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Fischer&amp;diff=73601630&amp;oldid=73544783" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Fischer&amp;diff=73601630&amp;oldid=73544783" rel="nofollow">the evidence supporting this edit</a>. Not every vocal critic of U.S. and Israeli foreign policy calls for genocide of American Jews; not every supporter of a Palestinian state wants Israel to be wiped from the map. Had Fischer stopped with his <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_x.html#Tensions" title="Malcolm x">"the chickens are coming home to roost"</a> remark--i.e., his opening reference to the BBC announcer's "what goes around comes around"--and urged reform of said foreign policies, the characterization might be fair. So I'm reverting while adding reference to Fischer's critique: kindly cite sources and context from the 9/11 interview to support alternative interpretations. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 18:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are any misquotations in the following. I would be happy to discuss a fair characterization of these statements:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Fuck the U.S., I want to see the U.S. wiped out."</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"It's time for the U.S. to eat the shit, to humble themselves, to withdraw their troops from around the world, to admit that they've been wrong, that's the only solution. Otherwise, the U.S. has to be destroyed."</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Death to President Bush! Death to the United States! Fuck the United States! Fuck the Jews!"</i> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Hallelujah, this is a wonderful day! Fuck the United States! Cry you crybabies, whine you bastards."</i> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>And here's the clincher:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"[...] I'm hoping for some kind of a <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Days_In_May_4388.html" title="Seven Days In May">Seven Days In May</a> scenario, where the country [</i>i.e., the United States<i>] will be taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders, and, you know, apologize to the Arabs, kill off all the Jews over there in the bandit state of Israel. I'm hoping for a totally new world."</i> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case, I would argue that "virulent" is unfortunately a justifiable characterization. RJF is not merely conducting a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Noam_Chomsky_b3b0.html" title="Politics of Noam Chomsky">Chomskyan</a> critique of 9/11 as jusitified blowback from the excesses of American imperialism, he's engaging in hate speech (and, unfortunately, self-hate speech). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 18:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The criticicsm of Billrock seems to me obviously biased, perhaps by a bit of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauvinism.html" title="Chauvinism">chauvinism</a>. Insults, profane and vulgar language, and such, are commonplace for the lay person, remember Fischer is no <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a>, and the undefined "hatred speech" of Billrock is used generously in the speechs of, for example, George W. Bush. If we call Fischer "hatred speaker" and not do the same with Bush who called lately, for example, to overthrow the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Cuba_1ddc.html" title="Government of Cuba">government of Cuba</a>, there would be no <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality.html" title="Neutrality">neutrality</a>. Wikipedia is not a stage for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> against anti-americans.</p>
<p>I think if Billrock could define "hatred speech", which sounds as a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_term.html" title="Loaded term">loaded term</a>, propagandistic bombastic, then it could be decided if it is neutral to characterize Fischer´s actions or words with it. From his point of view, he is engaging in legitimate <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissent.html" title="Dissent">dissent</a> against a fraudulent, criminal, oppresing regime, that of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<dd>I have no use for Mr. Bush myself, but I wish him a long and happy life, preferably devoid of any future influence on U.S. policy.

<p>Well, then we´re both in good faith. I accept Fischer "expresses hatred in his speech", but then again, that is too common in the speech of almost every person... It doesn´t have to be mentioned. Why? It gives a biased style, kind of neo-con, hawky, freaky... Who peruses that term in American politics, "hatred speech"...</p>
<p>But you must accept Fischer is not an almost maniac babbler all the time. He has some emotional disturbances, but his cognition holds the drive most of the time. Therefore, by being rational above all (who would dare to call him obtuse?) Fischer is entitled to his own opinion, to his argumentation as far as it keeps coherence. <a href="../../../d/r/c/User%7EDrcaldev_d54c.html" title="User:Drcaldev">Drcaldev</a> 21:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, the paragraph which Billrock adds the NPOV to, is obviously non neutral, because it is quoting Fischer, from whom one cannot expect neutrality on such topics as his motherland and racism! We already know he is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-american.html" title="Anti-american">anti-american</a>! What´s the proposed censorship about, then? Suppressing Fischer babbling as he claims was always done by US government before Internet? Now they control Wikipedia too? I think suppressing the vindicative arguments of Fischer, which are already qualified as hypomaniatic, would be pro-american <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauvinism.html" title="Chauvinism">chauvinism</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>. Ok, US is an admirable nation, objectively, but those were the words of Fischer. From his point of view the attackers of Septemeber 11, 2001 in New York were brave vindicators of the cause of the oppressed Palestinian people, a cause censored by American controlled media. If you don´t like those statements, well... then censor them in your mind, not in Wiki. And when you quote Fischer calling Israel a "bandit state", as an example of "hatred speech", perhaps you hadn´t notice such expression as mimicking the term "rogue state" which is almost official in the discourse of US actual <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers.html" title="Rulers">rulers</a>.

<dd>The WP project strives for an intersubjective ideal it calls <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a>. Einstein &amp; Schrödinger discovered the problem with the concept of "NPOV": <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html#Reference_frames.2C_coordinates_and_The_Lorentz_transformation" title="Special relativity">there is no absolute frame of reference</a>, and <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observer_effect.html" title="Observer effect">the act of observing affects the results</a>. In everyday life (not just in cyberspace), the parameters of NPOV are negotiated. IMO, Fischer's calling Israel a "bandit state" is most certainly not hate speech; however, I believe that calling for genocide, as Fischer did, is hate speech. Do you deny his call for genocide? I bet you don't. Or, more likely, do you find Fischer's advocacy of genocide unimportant because you discount it as the ramblings of an agitated person? I would direct you to the various mp3 radio interviews available at <a href="http://www.fischer.jp" class="external text" title="http://www.fischer.jp" rel="nofollow">Fischer's personal website</a>: his 9/12/01 statement was not unique.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the way to achieve NPOV on this is to acknowledge his hate speech, and note that many of his friends and admirers (including many Jews) discount this speech and ascribe it to his (probable) mental illness. As do I (I hasten to add that I am not a medical professional). I don't hate Fischer, I pity him and wish him well. I am not ascribing to mental illness his views on Palestinian rights. In fact, I happen to largely share those views, but neither my political worldview nor yours are germane to this article, are they?

<dd>The good part of this is the insanity, citing Cuba as a source, and the awful grammar. Needs more blaming the Jews for all our problems to be complete, just like all Commies do. <i>(Unsigned interpolated comment by User:72.144.60.229 )</i></dd>

<dd>hypomania is pure speculation and should definitely be removed. The words "very excitedly" may or may not be accurate, but are unnecessary.

<p>Re the featured email from Derek.</p>
<p>Clearly Derek, being average, has no clue to the intricate personality of Mr. Robert James Fischer. And I hope this can be forwarded to him (Derek), although it would amount to casting pearls before a swine.</p>
<p>Mr. Fischer's greatest skill is his stupendous ability to amass, retain, and process data at a speed much higher than the average Joe. He could have applied his genius to anything - to music, to art, and yes even to the stock exchange! He is not a Jesus Christ, even JS realised the futility of being a saviour to mortals that preferred the path of ignorance and stupidity.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages and from time to time, society in general is fortunate to witness such mental superiority envied and admired by the general populace - a populace, I might hasten to add that is gripped by stupidity in a vengeful cyclic vice and persuing meaningless materialistic manifestations that neither invigorate nor elevate towards the mosaic beauty of creativity.</p>
<p>Then here comes a dynamic character who finds no use nor need to be cosseted by the vagaries of an adulating audience merely for wealth and entertainment. The guy could care less, he is a one-man show - he eats, drinks and sleeps chess - he has mastered the complex moves like a traveller charting the intricacies of the great cosmos. He could care less for fame and fortune bestowed by dorks like you.</p>
<p>You want him to "come clean"? Come clean of what? He has every right to voice his views, just because they go against your hypocritical perspective doesnt mean he should shut up. And the poor guy has already paid for all that, paid heavily I might add. What more do you want?</p>
<p>You want a people persona, then kiss the ass of the likes of fat-ass dunce Oprah. With an IQ of zilch she is more up your ally and will continue to keep you entrenched in the swirling filth of flatus and ignorance.</p>

<p>I dunno how helpful the baseball analogy is. (I think DiMaggio's 56-game-streak might be better.) Was Steinitz's competition of similar caliber? Don't really think there's a comparison (though F benefitted from crushing ego of superoptimists L &amp; T). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 07:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't researched how strong Steinitz's opponents were. Fischer's were very likely stronger -- though T &amp; L could each have grabbed a few draws had they not been desperately trying to win. I didn't come up with the baseball analogy (just Johnny VdM), and am not wedded to it. I agree DiMaggio's streak would be a more apt comparison, but dunno if anyone besides you has made it. (Of course, whoever wrote that doesn't say who made the comparison to back-to-back no-hitters.) <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrakatoa_1362.html" title="User:Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> 11:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've removed the analogy, which is unsourced and inapposite. Winning 20 games in a row is not really comparable to back-to-back extraordinary games; the latter is certainly a statistical anomaly, like being struck by lightning two days in a row, but doesn't reflect the sort of sustained outstanding performance required to win 20 straight games. Note that Johnny Vander Meer, the only player to pitch back-to-back no-hitters, was actually a mediocre player, while DiMaggio emphatically was not. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrakatoa_1362.html" title="User:Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> 11:28, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article claimed that Fischer gave $61,200 of his $200,000 world championship prize money to the WWCOG. That can't be accurate. The total prize fund was $250,000, and as I recall the split was 5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the winner. No way was it $200,000/$50,000. I've accordingly removed the $200,000 claim. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrakatoa_1362.html" title="User:Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> 11:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the 1970 chronology is a bit off WRT Edmonson's intervention.</p>
<p>per Russians vs Fischer:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 March - 5 Apr 1970 Match of the Century</li>
<li>8 Apr 1970 Herceg Novi World Blitz Ch</li>
<li>12 Apr - 7 May 1970 Tnmt of Peace Rovinj-Zagreb (#1 Fischer 13/17, 2 pts ahead of Hort, Smyslov, Gligoric, Korchnoi, 2.5 pts ahead of Petrosian) It is at this point IMO that Fischer's CLEAR superiority to top Soviet players became obvious.</li>
<li>19 Jul - 15 Aug 1970 Buenos Aires (#1 Fischer 15/17, 3.5 pts ahead of Tukmakov; 4 to 6 pts ahead of Panno, Najdorf, Reshevsky, Gheorghiu, Smyslov, Mecking--all except Gheorghiu in this group were former/future Candidates) Confirming clear #1 status.</li>
<li>5-27 Sept 1970 Siegen Olympiad (Spassky's win against Fischer; Fischer's board one performance was solid but not otherworldly like his other 1970 results--calls #1 status into question a bit)</li>
<li>8 Nov - 13 Dec 1970 Palma Interzonal--3.5 point margin--confirmation of clear #1 status</li>
</ul>
<p>Two things: I think this year needs to be fleshed out a bit: one could argue that RJF was #1 as early as 1966-67, but he certainly wasn't dominant until 1970.</p>
<p>Also, per RvF page 190, Tal said circa April(?) 1970 that USCF was working on the Interzonal problem. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 21:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much as I appreciates Krakatoa's efforts to update the article, I think there's too much wikilinking of words. For words which everyone knows the meaning of, and which have no special meaning for the article (e.g. <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend.html" title="Legend">legend</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competition.html" title="Competition">competition</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular.html" title="Popular">popular</a>), I think wikilinking adds nothing to the article, and actually detracts from it (because there's so many useless links, you miss the useful ones). As for the work it takes: I'd rather the work went into real improvements to the text. But before I go reverting, I'd like to hear other opinions. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 03:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re: wikilinking dates: One reason to wikilink dates is so that you can use your preferences to choose the date style. That only applies to full dates, however, and there are differences of opinion whether linking bare years is good or not.

<p>I don't understand why Fischer is listed under "Jewish Chessplayers". Sure, his mother was jewish. So? After all, Judaism is a religion and Bobby was a follower of the Christian World Wide Church of God. He even wrote a letter to the encyclopedia judaica writing that he is not nor has ever been a jew. So why the listing? It DOES matter what Fischer claims! Or are you so racially obsessed that you are going to claim everybody with the slightest drop of jewish blood is a jew? That's simply ridiculous! Fischer even hates Judaism and isn't circumcised. He was born to a jewish mother, okay, but he is not a jew. Get this fact in your head. What's really annoying here is that if Bobby wasn't a chess genius, no single jew would ever claim he's a jew. It's just so typical...</p>
<p>BTW - what's someone with a jewish mother and a muslim father? According to the jews, a jew (if he becomes famous, of course), but according to Islam, a muslim. A muslim jew?

<dd>While I strongly disagree with the tone of the above comment, I have to agree with the basic point: Fischer clearly does not consider himself to be Jewish, and has gone so far as to write to the Encyclopedia Judaica (in a manner that is sadly typical of his anti-Semitic personality) explicitly denying their characterization of him as Jewish -- see <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_a/list/p_42/42_0.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_a/list/p_42/42_0.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_a/list/p_42/42_0.htm</a> . With this in mind, I think it is appropriate to delete the reference to him as a "Jewish chessplayer" unless and until someone can demonstrate that he has changed his position on his own identity.AlGordonCCD 17:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not really a good argument. Fischer has strongly condemned the U.S.—should he then be removed from <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_chess_players_e3d4.html" title="Category:American chess players">Category:American chess players</a>? The fact is that Fischer's mother and likely biological father were both Jewish and Fischer is named as a Jewish chess player in dozens of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources. Notice that Fischer is <i>ethnically</i> Jewish, not <i>religiously</i>. The fact that Fischer does not self identify as a Jew is adequately made in the article and by his inclusion in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Semitic_people_c721.html" title="Category:Anti-Semitic people">Category:Anti-Semitic people</a>.

<dd>It's not just the sources, but the quality of the sources. For me, the best source (apart from Fischer himself) is <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>. When Fischer wrote to them stating he was not Jewish,<a href="http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/list/p_42/42_0.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/list/p_42/42_0.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> they complied and removed him from EJ.

<dl>
<dd>Where's the source that says that EJ removed Fischer? Is this in fact verified? How is EJ the best <b>sources</b>? Surely it counts as only a single source? Even if that single source no longer includes Fischer, it alone doesn't outweigh all the sources that list Fischer as Jewish, and it certainly doesn't mean that Fischer is not ethnically Jewish. To say that Fischer is not Jewish does not reflect the dominant point of view, and gives undue weight to a minority viewpoint. As for quality of sources, how about <i>Profile of A Prodigy</i>, or <i>Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time</i>?

<dd>The "sources" (plural) which I refered to were EJ, and Fischer himself.

And no, you don't count sources, you weigh their importance. Do the books you cite refer to Fischer's religion after the mid-60s? In my library, I've only got two book that do this (ironically both by Jews). <i>From Morphy to Fischer</i> (by <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Horowitz_2f6e.html" title="Israel Horowitz">Israel Horowitz</a> Batsford, 1973) never calls Fischer Jewish as far as I can see, but on p.232 (describing the events of Sousse 1967) says, "<i>Reshevsky is an Orthodox Jew and Fischer a member of a fundamentalist Christian sect; both observe the Sabbath.</i>". So Horowitz says he's not Jewish. <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuben_Fine_6197.html" title="Reuben Fine">Reuben Fine</a>'s "<i>The World's Great Chess Games</i>" (McKay, 1976) never calls him a Jew, but says, "<i>he joined a religious sect some time around 1965 that went back to the fundamentals of the Bible. He has remained true to this sect ever since.</i>". I'll call that one unclear. But that's 3 pretty good sources saying he's not Jewish: Fischer himself, <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>, and Horowitz. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 09:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a semantic argument. I am not anti-semantics (oy). We all agree that neither Fischer nor his mother practiced Judaism, correct? So he's not a Jew in that restricted sense. Do we all also agree that at least one of Fischer's parents (and possibly both) were of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Jews_79ef.html" title="Ashkenazi Jews">Ashkenazi</a> descent? So he is a Jew in that restricted sense.

<dd>What Fischer craved far more than wealth was anonymity. To achieve it he assumed a new identity and began carrying a Nevada driver's license and a Social Security card bearing the pseudonym Robert D. James. This is the name that appears on the 1981 Pasadena police report. (His full name is Robert James Fischer.)</dd>

<dd>So perhaps we ought to say only that Mr. Fischer had by that time adopted that name, as evidenced in that pamphlet. --Wfaxon 13:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kpedsea 22:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC) replies: I see that you are correct Wfaxon, the cover lists the author as "Bobby Fischer" (and he copyrighted the pamphlet under that name) but he included a signature at the end as "Robert D. James (professionally known as Robert J. Fischer or Bobby Fischer, The World Chess Champion)." Your suggestion is fine by me.</dd>

<p>An IQ test at school I can believe, though I wonder how it became public. An anonymous user has now written that he was tested <i>again</i> as an adult.

<p>I'm not a big fan of the ephemeral crapola that goes into such sections.

And <i>possibly</i> the Law &amp; Order episode (because it's quite a major show (the ads keep telling me) and it's obviously heavily based on Fischer).

<p>Fischer's play in game 4 of the Taimanov match was masterful &amp; influenced a generation; one could say the same of thirty or forty other Fischer games. For other famous Fischer endings, see Game 1 of Larsen 1971 match, Game 7 of Petrosian 1971 match, Games 10 and 13 of Spassky 1972 match (off the top of my head). Kasparov cites the influence of Fischer's play in the <b>pure B v. N</b> ending (see Spassky's win against Fischer at 2nd Piat Cup 1967, Fischer's win against Unzicker, Siegen 1970). I am sure the editor of this section is aware of how Fischer horribly botched (by his high standards) the win in the 2nd game of the Taimanov match, only winning because of Taimanov's counter-blunder. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 23:38, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. I put this over here because the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fischer%27s_endgame.html" title="Fischer's endgame">Fischer's endgame</a> is almost certainly going to be deleted. (I think it should be deleted, I put it up for AfD.) But I did find one reference in English to the endgame of R+B vs. R+N (plus pawns) being called the "Fischer endgame" (the reference is in the article). On the other hand, I found quite a few references where the endgame was discussed, but "Fischer endgame" was not mentioned where you might expect it to be: the online article by Muller, the Oxford Companion, Soltis, Kasparov, Shereshevsky, Hansen, and now the new book by Silman. So do you think it should be taken out alltogether? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It belongs in the "Notable chess games" section. Soon someone will be arguing that Fischer contributed to the theory of positions with Q, 2 B's, N's,&amp; R's, and 8 pawns. Neither in the AfD nor in this article is Fischer's contribution to theory articulated. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 14:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or maybe Fischer's other endgame when Fischer shows that R &amp; N are stronger than R &amp; B. (Cf. game 7 of Petrosian match.) Here's a similarity between Fischer, Karpov, &amp; Kramnik: none of them are doctrinaire about the superiority of Bishop to Knight. (Cf. "Even a bad Bishop is better than a Knight," per Kasparov.) <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 14:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, when you see a position won by a world champion class player against a much weaker player, you wonder if it was a win because of the position or because the better player out played the weaker one. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 07:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
