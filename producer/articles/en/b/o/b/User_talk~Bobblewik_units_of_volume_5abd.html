<p>I adjusted the units based on my experience - I've never seen a vendor quote large flow rates in thousands of litres per minutes. In the article I left the "tons" alone, since they were obviously meant to provide orders of magnitude for the quantities involved and a 10% change in the number for metric "tonnes" would not have made these numbers any clearer for the SI-oriented reader. I have the misfortune that in my country we have the most confusing mish-mash of SI and Imperial units on Earth; I order cable by metres of length and AWG for diameter, for instance, and I've actually seen a drawing in which plan distances were given in feet and inches and elevations were given in metres. Strictly speaking engineering practice for lengths of equipment, etc. is to express them in mm, not decimal metres but I left the metres alone in the article. I should probably have converted 75 litres per minute to 0.01 m<sup>3/s</sup>. And I tried to keep the precision in line with the inch/lb system units originally given. I screwed up on the barrel conversion - there isn't any "bbl" shown in the CRC Handbook table that is particularly close to 200 litres, which is what I'd thought. It does give 158.98 litres for a U.S. barrel of petroleum.</p>
<p>Somone had converted my "millions of cubic metres of natural gas" in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba_Hydro_5728.html" title="Manitoba Hydro">Manitoba Hydro</a> to "cubic kilometres" - incorrectly, and that unit is never used in the natural gas business.</p>
<p>And in today's paper the front page says a group camping in Bird's Hill Park were hit with 30 millitres of rain...and I wondered if they had to use one paper towel or two to get dry again. At this rate it will be 100 years before this country is really properly SI. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 15:53, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah yes. That conversion in Manitoba Hydro of billion cubic metres to cubic kilometres was me. I am sure that I converted it correctly. I did see your subsequent revert saying that it is inappropriate because it is not familiar in the domain. I appear to place less emphasis than you on domain familiarity being a reason to avoid optimal SI expressions. However, it isn't a big deal in that specific case and I did not mind the revert at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as 'tons' is concerned. I take a similar view to you. I have avoided dealing with them so far because the values are fairly close and I never know which of the several non-metric tons is being used. The effort in metrication is more than the benefit. If the effort or the benefit were different, I might do something about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as '30 ml' of rain is concerned, I saw something similar recently.

<dd>I can't deny that billion m³ is a strange unit to use, but people are used to reading it and hearing it. Most people monitor their gas usage in m³, so it will be easier for most people to understand a billion familiar units over km³ even though they are the same units. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it should be accessable to the widest audience possible. The widest audience will be familiar with m³ and billion m³.

<dd>There is no serious ambiguity.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm sure that in general, your work on standardising units of measure and their representation is a good thing. However, is it necessary or appropriate to convert storage of lakes or consumption of water from megalitres (or kilolitres) to km³ or m³? Is Australia unique in reporting storage, consumption and flow in volume measures rather than cubic linear measures? I am scientifically literate, and had to think to determine what these units mean. I expect most readers would prefer to find the encyclopaedia descriptions use the same units as all other reports of related things. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 02:54, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about Australia but my UK water is measured in cubic metres. The term megalitre was unfamiliar to me. Volume is, of course, the same as cubic linear. The only difference is that the cubic metre is SI and the litre is not. The litre is defined such that 1000 litres = 1 cubic metre. Since you are scientifically literate, I assume that you were just using a turn of phrase when you contrasted 'cubic linear' with 'volume' and I am sure that I know what you meant. Perhaps the use of megalitres is indeed more common in Australia than elsewhere. I did a quick google search but did not come to a conclusion. Thanks for mentioning it. Feel free to revert it. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 07:52, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Irrigation water is billed in megalitres. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 09:43, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aha. Thanks for the reference. I have learnt something. I have been investigating and I now see that megalitres is not unique to Australia, unsurprisingly. I had only noticed the use of cubic metres for water before. So both are used but I don't know the proportions. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 09:52, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recall learning at primary school that Australia uses the "metric" system, which is based on, but not quite the same as the SI system of measures. Our national measurement regulator's website is <a href="http://www.measurement.gov.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.measurement.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.measurement.gov.au/</a> but I can't find a direct reference of which units should be used. I did find the <a href="http://www.measurement.gov.au/assets/documents/nmiinternet/14-3-120040826112606.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.measurement.gov.au/assets/documents/nmiinternet/14-3-120040826112606.pdf" rel="nofollow">certificate</a> for a domestic water meter that measures in kL. A bottle of wine here is 750 mL, not 750 cm³. Should measures of volume in Australia be given in mL, L, kL, ML with m³ etc. in parentheses for international comparison? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 12:50, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SI units are officially defined and listed on the web by the BIPM (<a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/" class="external free" title="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bipm.org/en/si/</a>). They say SI is the 'modern form of the metric system'. The term <i>modern</i> is time limited so the phrase <i>modern form of the</i> will eventually no longer apply (SI is already 35 years old). If that is true, then a unit is only metric if it is SI. Any other use of the term 'metric unit' would then be either merely colloquial or misinformed. I have a lot of sympathy with that interpretation.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The BIPM goes on to say:
<ul>
<li><i>recognizing that users would wish to employ the SI with units which are not part of it but are important and widely used, listed three categories of non-SI units: units to be maintained; to be tolerated temporarily; and to be avoided.</i> (<a href="http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/4-1.html" class="external free" title="http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/4-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/4-1.html</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However their list of non-SI units does not help with the definition of 'metric'. For example they put 'litre' (often called a metric unit) in the same table as 'day' (I have never heard this described as a metric unit).</dd>

<dd>When people say something like 'Australia is not SI, it is metric' that is a reasonable practical statement for the audience. We know what SI is and Australia has not converted to that. We don't really know what the 'metric system' means but it does not matter much. As Humpty Dumpty said, "words mean what I choose them to mean". I looked at www.measurement.gov.au and I see that even now, the Australian government is changing regulations about metrication. Each country applies different rules as they go along. The same applies to UK regulations and that is well behind Australia. So perhaps that is the answer, it is whatever the lawmakers say is metric.</dd>

<dd>As far as I know, UK law permits wine volume to be stated in cubic metres or litres. It is up to the manufacturer. I generally see litre based units too. It is interesting to me that vehicle engines are quoted in both: cubic centimetres for small volumes and litres for large volumes. The more I look at units, the less confident I become that there is much sense in what people do: British people sometimes operate on what has been called 'Celsiheit': Celsius up to at least room temperature and Fahrenheit for sunbathing temperatures.</dd>

I prefer large units for large quantities but I don't worry too much about versions of 'metric units'. There are plenty of articles that have yet to have metric units added to them and that is the more important issue. I am sure that if an Australian is comfortable with the units, then other metric readers will also understand.

<p>As an aside, in biology we only use litre for volumes. I have never seen the 'cubic linear'. I don't know how ecologists measure lake volumes but I'd be surprised if they do not use litres. While L (or l) is not an official SI unit it is definitely an approved unit for use in the SI system. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 16:03, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You guys got me thinking about kL and ML. It appears to be most common in Australian websites. I ran a few google regional surveys. You may know that you can restrict the search to a nation, or even language, by going to www.google.co.uk, www.google.com.au, www.google.fr etc. The search in this case is made more difficult by the fact that there are unsearchable terms like m&amp;sup3 and m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, you may be interested in some results:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>water (megalitres OR kilolitres OR kiloliters OR megaliters)</i>
<ul>
<li>29,400 (Australia only)</li>
<li>45,900 (all web)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>water (m3 OR "cubic metres" OR "cubic meters")</i>
<ul>
<li>50,200 (Australia only)</li>
<li>1,290,000 (all web)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, I don't mind if kL and ML are used. I just thought I would let you know what I found. These terms are not 'unique' to Australia. But in Google, Australia is responsible for more than half of the uses. The proportion is higher on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 21:57, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I changed it because the conversion is wrong. The value 18,200,000 cubic meters =
<ul>
<li>4,810,000,000 US gallons</li>
<li>4,000,000,000 imperial gallons</li>

It has the text <i>18,200,000 cubic meters (4,200 million gallons)</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I started editing the page was that the ambiguous term 'gallon' needs to be resolved with the prefix 'imp' or 'US'. When I investigated the values, I found the additional problem of misconversion. If you have a different suggestion for resolving the error, please feel free to try.</dd>

<dd>I hadn't thought about US vs imperial gallons. The problem is that I have no way of knowing which figure WASA is working from. Gallons in Trinidad is usually imperial gallons, so I suspect that whoever wrote the web entry simply converted whichever number they had using the US gallon formula. If the estimate was based on m<sup>3</sup> and converted to gallons, it's fine. If they estimate is based on imperial gallons and then converted to m<sup>3</sup>, then the end product is wrong. Knowing WASA, it could be either one, but if I had to guess at which figure was correct I'd go for the 4,800 million (imperial) gallons. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 23:28, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought that Trinidad would usually use imperial gallons. The round number (4,000 million imp gal) was consistent with that. But I could not explain how they arrived at the wrong numerical values. Your reasoning explains it. Feel free to put it the way you think it is.</dd>

<dd>WASA customer service might be interested to know that they have a misconversion and could find the correct value. I suspect not, but it might be worth a phone call.</dd>

<dd>It always helps to know which is the original and which is conversion. Putting the original first and the conversion second provides that certainty.

Some people think it should vary according to complicated rules. This is a classic case of a problem caused by uncertainty over which is the original. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 10:36, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following your lead in using the Google converter, I recently added some metric measurements to <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Enterprise_%281799%29_9ea5.html" title="USS Enterprise (1799)">USS Enterprise (1799)</a>. I was not sure about the ship's displacement in tons. Do you use some kind of metric conversion for tons in ship articles? ♠ <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:14, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent. I am glad that you are doing that. As far as tons are concerned, I usually leave them alone. The problems with metricating a word like 'ton' are too complicated for me. I am hoping that somebody else can work out what to do.

<p>Hi there. I've reverted all of your changes to brewery articles to change litres back to hectolitres. I guess you didn't notice that they were all consistent for a reason, but hectolitres are the conventional metric units used when talking about brewery production. The European Union beer regulations use hectolitres. It is the de-facto standard.
