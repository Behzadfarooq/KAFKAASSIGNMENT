<p><i>As for your claims I was ignoring sources - bah, I'm not, you know that.</i> This is contradicted by your behaviour on Kulturkampf talks page, where you either ignored or called cherrypicked every source I provided, going to a point to claim that Bismarcks speech isn't true. The fact of the matter is that right now we have several books, articles against your single objection to write about persecution of Poles in the article.</p>

   * Remove section "Effect on Poles"
   * Remove reference to Poles in Introduction
   * Leave reference to Poles in Overview, but only in reference to Bismark's excuse.

<p>This is unacceptable, it would erase an important part of history of Kulturkampf.As my sources show this was a major event for Poles. The fact that it took part in Germany is irrelevent as it consisted of Polish territory taken in Partitions of Poland, and unfortunetely Poles had to share history as members of German Empire.Kulturkampf isn't just German history, its also Polish history and the article should also focus on this as well. I provided enough sources on the discussion page proving this.May I know why want to ignore them&#160;? Why should the effect on Poles be deleted if it is one of the focal points of Polish national revival in Wielkopolska&#160;? --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:14, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Bismarck believed that a rehabilitated Poland would mean disaster for Prussia. He would not tolerate the prospect of any separatist movement in his drive to create a unified Germany. This was probably Bismarck's main motive for embarking upon the infamous "Kulturkampf,"--the "War of Civilizations," "Prussianism against Christianity." This war began as a Prussian policy against the interference of Rome in the unification of Germany. To Bismarck it became a personal matter of race and culture, especially where the Poles were concerned. In a conflict with Rome, he knew that Catholic Poland would be more difficult to control. The notorious "May Laws" of 1873 forbade the clergy from speaking about state affairs in church, made civil marriage compulsory, and demanded that the state supervise all school inspection. Other provisions of the 20 Laws were more harsh, and directly involved Polish Catholics. No priest could hold office in the Church unless he was German and educated at a German university. Bismarck underestimated Polish tenacity regarding matters of faith. The Church provided a great source of solace and a sense of unity to the Polish people. Polish Catholicism combines fervor with mysticism and nationalism. In May, 1874, German was declared to be the only official language of instruction. Because of their refusal to comply, many priests were imprisoned and the churches stood empty. For the Poles, the "war of civilizations" had become a war against them and their culture THE HISTORY AND CULTURE OF POLAND by Judith Zielinski-Zak</p>

In subsequent years, all laws pertaining to the Kulturkampf were repealed, except those on misuse of the pulpit, state supervision of schools, civil marriage, and the ban on the Jesuits.</i> In Prussia's eastern regions, the Kulturkampf coincided with a policy of Germanization, which was intensified by resettlement in the 1880s. Bismarck had made his anti-Polish stance known in drastic statements written to his sister as early as 1861: Beat thc Poles until they despair of living [.] . . . I have all thc sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to survive we can do nothing othcr than wipe them out. The wolf cannot help it, either, that God made him the way he is, and one shoots him dead anyway for it if one can.

<p>History 1871-1939 Warszawa 2000 dr.Anna Radziwił prof.dr.hab Wojciech Roszkowski</p>
<p>Anna Radziwil-vicemnister of education in Poland, senator,history teacher, director of several Gymnasiums in Warsaw Wojciech Roszkowski-director of Institute of Political Studies PAN, lecturer in Main Trade School,Collegium Civitas, gives lectures in United States Universities, author of several works from history of Poland and the world.</p>
<p>Page 80. The fight against Polishness had a widespread range-it touched political sphere, national-cultural sphere, as well as economic one, and was led thru legal methods, by "law". You could process with Prussian authorities-something unthinkable in Russian part of partitoned Poland, where such an attempt would end in arrest or deportation. Intesification of the fight against Polishness happened after unification of Germany.(1871), when nationalistic(pangerman) feelings rose, whos representant was von Bismarck.This fight was led mostly in Grand Duchy of Poznan which was renamed Posen Province.Polish population had majority there(60 %) and had its own strong intelectual elites.On other lands of Prussian partition of Poland for example Pomerania Poles were minority and hadn't got strong intelectual elites.In Upper Silesia the few polish intelectuals for example Karol Miarka-who discovered his polish roots as an adult men-tried to preserve or even resurrect Polishness of the common people. In Poznan the fight with Polishness and about Polish culture took many forms.It was a fight over land, language and Church.In this fight the whole Polish society took part, both its upper classes, as well as peasents, which led to creation of GrandPolish ethos(etos wielkopoznanski)-which was made of interclass solidarity, strong connection to catholicism-the mark of being a Pole, and patriotic justified ability to selforganise and development. Centralne Towarzystwo Gospodarcze-existing from 1861, peasent circles, many forms of communes,peoples banks, and also Towarzystwo Czytelni Ludowych(Society of Reading for the Folk), singing societies-created an social infrastucture, which opposed the germanisation offensive.Gen. Dezydery Chlapowski,Maksymilian Jackowski, Roman Szymanski, priest Piotr Wawrzyniak were great patrons of these forms of national activity of Grand Polish society(...) Quite unexpectly a hero of the fight against german policy was to become archbishop of Gniezno Mieczyslwaw Ledóchowski, who at first period of his activity cut himself off from Polish activities.In 1872 however Bismarck started to pursue Kulturkampf policy.According to this priests were turned away from education for example.In schools german language was made compulsory apart from religion.Government wanted to have say in who will become who in church hierarchy.Civil marriages have become compulsory, and made of course only by german. officials.Ledóchowski who opposed this was arrested in 1874.This merging of fight against Catholicism with figh against Poles created in Polish society a feeling of identity between being a Pole and being a Catholic.It was then when the stereotype of "Polish Catholic" was created.Bismarck retreated from the most severe laws of Kulturkampf in late 70s.However antipolish legislation remained in place, and in 80s German government conducted another offensive. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC) All of this information is relevant to Kulturkampf.</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps then it would be advisable to give a chapter Kulturkampf in Poland&#160;? The fact that histography is short on Polish subject shouldn't stop us-most of the sources I provided aren't Polish anyway, as the wiki is international it should present all points of view-including the Polish aspect of Kulturkampf. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 13:44, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

You could create the article <b>Kulturkampf in Poland</b>. But the definition of Kulturkampf does not include a refernce to Poland or Poles or the discrimination thereof, so it would most likely be deleted on the grounds that it is irrelevant. The fact is that Kulturkampf is understood differently in German, Polish and English, and the English word that describes the plight of the Poles is <b>Germanization</b>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 13:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We can also see that Bismarck himself claimed Kulturkampf was aimed against Poles.So far no evidence has been provided that the speech is forged, or he lied. The link to the speech is titled "Polish Question", is among materials recommended for German teachers and the speech is given a forwad explanation: [The immediate background for this long speech was the brutal expulsions from Prussian territory of Poles and Polish Jews carried out in 1885. Many of these people had been resident in Prussia for years but had not become citizens, no easy matter in Germany. Polish deputies in the Reichstag formally questioned the government on these policies. Bismarck responded by denying the competence of the Reichstag in Prussian state matters. Shortly thereafter a majority of the lower house of the Prussian parliament moved a declaration for the protection of German interests in the eastern provinces. With this friendlier stimulus, Bismarck laid out the principles of the government's Polish policies. A typical Bismarck speech, it was delivered extempore (as were all speeches in the Reichstag and German state parliaments), filled with innuendo and threats and short on specific details. The intention here is to stifle criticism of an increasingly rigorous anti-Polish government policy, justifying it as an entirely reasonable response to Polish provocation. All the good will comes from the German side; all the bad faith belongs to the Poles. Source: Eugen Kalkschmidt (ed.), Bismarcks Reden (Berlin, n.d.), pp. 173-86. Translated by Richard S. Levy.] <a href="http://www.h-net.org/~german/gtext/kaiserreich/speech.html" class="external free" title="http://www.h-net.org/~german/gtext/kaiserreich/speech.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.h-net.org/~german/gtext/kaiserreich/speech.html</a></p>
<p>The source you just quoted indicates that it is Germanization and not Kulturkampf that was directed against the Poles. Kulturkampf <b>does not refer to the plight of Poles</b>.

<p><i>1. Kulturkampf didn't persecute Poles&#160;? Care to give a source on that&#160;?</i> I didn't say it didn't persecute poles. I said it wasn't directed at poles exclusively. So if it did then they its notable and should be put forward in the article.</p>
<p><br />
<i>2.Please then give historical source claiming his speech is false.</i></p>
<p>I don't need to. His speech is generally ignored in historical reviews of his intentions, the concensus is that he used the Polish as an excuse.</p>
<p>You DO need to. Otherwise its your POV, and not supported by anything.</p>
<p><i>3.Please give source claiming that.</i></p>
<p>Asked and answered.</p>
<p><i>4.I already gave you a book published by Ministry of Education of the Republic of Poland.</i> You are claiming it is original reasearch&#160;? Of course I am. <b>It is</b> orginal research, but is acceptable because it was <b>Published</b>. It makes use however of the Polish term <b>Kulturkampf</b> which differs in meaning from its English cognative. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 14:25, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please give me a source claiming Polish word is different&#160;? Anyway that is irrelevent since its isn't a word but a event that is described under such title, unless you prove that Polish sources are wrong I see no reason why they should be ignored. Just because in your view English sources ignore persecution of Poles under Kulturkampf doesn't mean International Wiki shouldn't take into account sources from various countries.And indeed it often does as research on some topics is limited in English speaking word. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 14:37, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hardly a Polish or Non-English source: <a href="http://www.texasalmanac.com/culture/groups/polish.html" class="external free" title="http://www.texasalmanac.com/culture/groups/polish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.texasalmanac.com/culture/groups/polish.html</a> Back in Poland, another insurrection was put down in 1863, resulting in increased restrictions from the ruling powers. In the Prussian partition, Bismarck’s Kulturkampf, a program enforcing German culture onto the Polish people, caused about 152,000 Poles to leave the provinces of Pozan, Bydgoszcz and Silesia. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 14:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The source stated <i>Bismarck instituted the Kulturkampf, with a special anti-Polish emphasis as Germanification intensified.</i> Now I don't know what you understood by that, but it is refering to <i>Germanification(which isn't even a word, germanization is)</i>, as being the policy that was directed at Poles. Ofcourse the Kulturkampf affected Poles; they are predominantly catholic, but it affected them only due to that coincidence. <b>It was a side effect</b>. Sure, the number of Poles in the German Empire increased the number of catholics, so it may have even been a motivating factor, but it was not due to ethnicity, but rather due to religion. I don't need to contradict your source; it's correct. I think you are misinterpreting it.</p>
<p><i>Ok I found it. There is nothing there that contradicts the book I presented. No sentence that Poles weren't persecuted.As we have a scholary source showing this you must find me a source denying that view.</i></p>
<p>That's laughable. Your're saying that because it's not <b>excluded</b> from a definition, it is therefore included. By that logic any word could mean anything on the basis that its definiton doesn't exclude *insert concept here*. I'm not going to entertain this argument if you don't stop being ridiculous.</p>

<p><i>In the Prussian partition, Bismarck’s Kulturkampf, a program enforcing German culture onto the Polish people, caused about 152,000 Poles to leave the provinces of Pozan, Bydgoszcz and Silesia.</i></p>
<p>The source only refers to the polish refugees. It therefore only reports the facts from the aforemention Catholic Poles who were discriminated against. It does not say that the Poles were the exclusive target, and, <b>as a matter of fact</b> they weren't. It does say that they were a target, a fact which I have never disputed. The article does not support your contention that they were targeted as Poles, they were targeted as catholics. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 14:54, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</pre>
<p>Incorrect-I already provided definition that includes certain things. If you want to prove they are not correct then you need to find a source contradicting what I showed.That is that Kulturkampf didn't have a Polish aspect which you are arguing. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 15:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC) <i>they are predominantly catholic, but it affected them only due to that coincidence</i> The book I presents says otherwise-it says that the laws had an antipolish character in regions of Poznan. So please give a source contradicting what the book says. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 15:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC) <i>so it may have even been a motivating factor, but it was not due to ethnicity, but rather due to religion.</i> Several sources claim otherwise.Bismarck claims otherwise.Bismarck's antipolish quotes are presented. Please provide sources denying sources I presented, that is denying that the laws in region of Poznan were motivated by attempt to persecute Polish people. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 15:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC) Basically you are saying though that Poles weren't persecuted in Germany for being Poles then&#160;?

<i>Basically you are saying though that Poles weren't persecuted in Germany for being Poles then&#160;?</i></p>
<p>No, that is not what I am saying. I'm saying that when they were persecuted for being Poles it's called Germanization, and when they're persecuted for being catholic, that's called Kulturkampf <b>IN ENGLISH</b>. Polish or German definitions of Kulturkampf are irrelevant. They article's title is the <b>English cognative</b> of the German word. The term Germanization refers to the persecution of Poles for their ethnicity during that period. Kulturkampf refers to the stuggle of the government against the Catholic Church, of which many poles within the Empire were members.</p>
<p>Why would there be two similtaneous programs in the german empire to solve the same problem?</p>

<p><i>I'm saying that when they were persecuted for being Poles it's called Germanization</i> They were users already that alreadt told us that Germanisation was quite neutral and didn't persecute Poles in any way&#160;:) But joking aside Kulturkampf in Polish territories was part of Germanisation and I see no proof on your part that Polish sources are wrong. I am still waiting. As the Wiki is internationa all points of view are presented. I showed scholary sources from Poland and elswhere.Please show yours that support your opinion that Kulturkampf wasn't part of Germanisation. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 16:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<i>As the Wiki is internationa all points of view are presented.</i></p>
<p>No. Major points of view are to be presented with added weight. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOVUW</a> states that you must give weight to the prevailing POV and only lightly mention others. The prevailing point of view is clearly that the Kulturkampf was directed against Catholics in general. The Kulturkampf was not a part of germanization, and the assertion that is, is unjustifiable. Kulturkampf discriminated against Catholic Germans as well, how could that possibly constitute germanization? I'm not wasting my time googling for internet sources that proove my point, because it's accepted by the dictionary that the Kulturkampf was meant to keep the catholics in check. The assertion that germanisation is neutral is even more ridiculous. It was a process designed to eliminate other cultures <b>in favor of the German one</b>.</p>
<p>In short: Religious policies were Kulturkampf. Ethnic policies were Germanization. That is the english terminology. I'm not disputing that the Kulturkampf affected Poles, but it affected Germans aswell, and Bismark already had a program to get the poles to germanize.</p>
<p>The entire reason for the existence of these two terms in English is to differentiate between them. Can you show me an example of a policy that falls under Kulturkampf that affected Poles exclusively?</p>
