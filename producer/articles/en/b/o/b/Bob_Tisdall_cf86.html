<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Tisdall_cf86.html" title="Edit section: Early Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Career</span></h2>
<p>As a school boy, at a <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> boarding school, Tisdall won the Public Schools 440 yards (402 m), and at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> he won a record four events – 440 yards (402 m) and 120 yards (110 m) hurdles, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_jump.html" title="Long jump">long jump</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shot_put.html" title="Shot put">shot put</a> – in the annual match against <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. This record was only equalled nearly 60 years later. Tisdall had a chance to compete in five events, but selected Ted Cawston to run for him in the 220 yd (201 m) low hurdles so that Cawston could receive his "blue". Cawston justified his selection by winning the event that Tisdall had won the previous two years.</p>
<p>Tisdall set <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> records in the 220 yards (201 m) low hurdles in 1929, a year later setting <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> records in the same event. While at Cambridge in March 1932, he decided to try for a place in the Irish Olympic squad and after he ran 54.2 seconds (a record) for the Irish Championship 440 yards (402 m) hurdles in June that year, the authorities agreed to let him run in his new event at the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> Olympics, where he also came eighth in the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decathlon.html" title="Decathlon">decathlon</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Tisdall_cf86.html" title="Edit section: Olympics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Olympics</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, as an independent nation, had won its first Olympic gold medal at <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> with Dr. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_O%27Callaghan_80f6.html" title="Pat O'Callaghan">Pat O'Callaghan</a>'s unexpected victory in the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammer_throw.html" title="Hammer throw">hammer</a> event. At the time he was barely out of the novice class and he had been included in the Irish Team mainly to gain experience of top-class competition. Over the years, he was to develop into one of the world's greatest hammer-throwers and he demonstrated this by winning his second Olympic gold medal at Los Angeles in 1932.</p>
<p>This in fact brought a very special moment in Olympic history for Ireland. Within the short space of an hour Ireland won two Olympic gold medals on Monday, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>.</p>
<p>The first was won by Tisdall. His father won the All-Irish Sprint Championship; his mother played <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">hockey</a> for Ireland and was a formidable <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golfer</a>. His Olympic victory had the "element of a fairy tale about it", as one commentator put it.</p>

<p>Tisdall had, in the midst of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Depression_d2ed.html" title="The Depression">The Depression</a>, what he describes as "the best job in the world", as an aide to a young <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharaja.html" title="Maharaja">Maharaja</a>, escorting him around <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, showing him the cultural and natural sights. To pursue his Olympic dream, Tisdall had to leave this job and live in a disused railway carriage in an orchard, where he trained by running around the rows of trees. Early in 1932, he wrote to General <a href="../../../e/o/i/Eoin_O%27Duffy_2319.html" title="Eoin O'Duffy">Eoin O'Duffy</a>, then the President of the Irish Olympic Council, and asked to be considered for the Irish Olympic Team in the 400 metres hurdles and he also confessed that he had not previously run in the event.</p>
<p>O'Duffy was convinced that Tisdall could achieve a good time and later invited Tisdall to compete in a special Olympic trial at <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croke_Park_ebdd.html" title="Croke Park">Croke Park</a> in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Tisdall failed to make the qualifying time, but O'Duffy gave him another chance and Tisdall qualified for the Irish Team by winning the National 440 yards (402 m) hurdles title at the Irish Championships, also at Croke Park. At the team training camp, Tisdall discovered that there were no hurdles, so he collected driftwood from the beach and set up some crude hurdles on the greyhound racing track. This took him much of the morning, but just when he was ready to hurdle, someone activated the mechanical rabbit, which sped around the track rail, promptly knocking all the makeshift hurdles over. Finding out that there were hurdles available at a local girls' school, Tisdall cycled there and back each day, to use the hurdles, as the students were on vacation.</p>
<p>After winning his preliminary Olympic heat in Los Angeles, Tisdall equalled the Olympic record of 52.8 seconds in the semi-finals. As this was only the fifth time he competed at this event, Tisdall says: " I said to myself, 'Well, you've run in the semi-finals and equalled the Olympic record; Bob, you're really getting the hang of this!"</p>
<p>Then in the final, despite stumbling at the final hurdle, he won the Olympic gold medal in 51.7 seconds which would have been a world record but for the fact that he had knocked over the last hurdle, and under the laws prevailing at the time, this ruled out recognition of a world record. It is worth noting that four Olympic hurdles champions appeared in that one race.</p>
<p>"At that moment I experienced a strange feeling of loneliness--everything was strangely quiet--I began to wonder if the rest of the field had fallen over" - Bob Tisdall, approaching the final hurdle of the 1932 Olympic Games 400 m hurdles final, five meters ahead of the field.</p>
<p>After his victory, Tisdall was invited to a dinner in L.A. where he was seated next to <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Earhart_2a46.html" title="Amelia Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a> on one side and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Fairbanks%2C_Jr._cf18.html" title="Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a> on the other.</p>

<p>Later in life, Tisdall lived in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, where he ran a gymnasium during the day, which he converted to a night club after dark. He grew coffee in <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, but moved to Nambour in 1969 with his wife Peggy, where he farmed fruit crops and cattle. He admitted to running his last race at the age of 80, though he ran in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Summer_Olympics_2af9.html" title="2000 Summer Olympics">Sydney Olympic</a> torch relay at age 93. At that point he was the oldest living recipient of an individual track and field Olympic medal and was offered the opportunity to present the medals for the 400m hurdles at the Sydney Olympics but declined as he felt it would detract from the attention due to the winner.</p>
<p>At the age of 96 he fell down a steep set of rock stairs and broke his shoulder, ribs and ruptured his spleen. He never completely recovered and died on the 27th of July, 2004, aged 97. At that time, he was the worlds oldest track and field Olympic Gold medalist.</p>
<p>Tisdall did not want a funeral, because "they are altogether too sad." His wake was attended by family and a few friends.</p>
