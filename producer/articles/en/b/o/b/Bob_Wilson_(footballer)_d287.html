<p>Wilson started late as a professional player as his father would not let him sign papers with <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> as he thought it wasn't a reasonable job while he was a youth. Wilson then went on to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughborough_University_c16c.html#The_Loughborough_colleges" title="Loughborough University">Loughborough College</a> for training as a teacher before signing for Arsenal in 1963. He had been playing reserve games for <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolves</a> as an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">amateur</a> and made his debut for Arsenal as an amateur, making him the last non-professional to play in the top division, and the first amateur to have a transfer fee paid (around £6,500). Even then, it was five years before he became the first-choice keeper in 1968. In 1971 he was Arsenal's player of the year in their famous <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Double_e855.html" title="The Double">Double</a>-winning season.</p>
<p>He became eligible to play for Scotland when the rules were changed in the 1970s to allow players to play for their parent's country of origin, if they had not already played for their own country. Wilson was selected by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Docherty_8c44.html" title="Tommy Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a> for his two games in charge, but Docherty then left the position and the next manager preferred another English-born keeper, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Harvey_602c.html" title="David Harvey">David Harvey</a> of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_F.C._ad1c.html" title="Leeds United F.C.">Leeds United</a>.</p>
<p>Wilson continued to play as Arsenal's keeper through the early 1970s, although an injury late on in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971-72_in_English_football_a69e.html" title="1971-72 in English football">1971-72</a> meant he missed Arsenal's 1972 Cup Final loss to Leeds United and much of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972-73_in_English_football_85e4.html" title="1972-73 in English football">1972-73</a> season, with understudy <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Barnett_%28footballer%29_aa33.html" title="Geoff Barnett (footballer)">Geoff Barnett</a> taking his place. Wilson regained his place once fully recovered, and was Arsenal's No. 1 up until his surprisingly early retirement from playing in May 1974, at the age of 32.</p>
<p>As a student and teacher of goalkeeping, Wilson has identified his own signature technique as diving at his opponents' feet to save goals. This has caused him a number of injuries throughout his career. Wilson also played goal without the use of goalkeeping gloves, something very rare at the time and completely unknown today.</p>

<p>After his football career he immediately became a football television presenter working firstly for the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> then for <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> until his retirement in 2002.
