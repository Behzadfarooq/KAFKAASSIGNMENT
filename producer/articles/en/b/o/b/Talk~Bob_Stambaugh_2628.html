<p>"Bob Stambaugh was a co-founder of the International Human Resource Information Management (IHRIM) association and the father of the HR systems industry. He made a tremendous impact on the field of HR technology with his visions of alternative futures and his ability to push vendors, consultants, and practitioners to think outside the box looking for new and better ways of working." --KarenBeaman 21:37, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Over the past 10 years, I knew Bob Stambaugh from several perspectives: as a client, colleague and friend. There are many things that I will remember about Bob, including that he was a voracious reader and a prolific writer. But, I think what I will remember most about him was that he was the eternal "devil's advocate." He challenged the status quo at every turn and encouraged everyone he came in contact with to do likewise. I think he always felt that HR technology professionals were in unique and valuable positions, and they had an obligation and an opportunity to explore all technology options to continue to be the liaisons between people and process. And he believed that IHRIM could be the catalyst by serving as the collective center of knowledge for HR information management both locally and globally." -- [User:Tom Faulkner] 15:46, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"I met Bob in 1986. I was in the HR group at Apple at the time, and I had just been asked to create a new group reporting to the HR Director, that we loftily called the HR Systems, Technology and Innovation Group. I knew nothing about HR systems at the time and I knew I needed to learn fast so I gathered together a group of outside consultants that had been referred to me by Don Drucker who was then HRIS Manager at AMD. Happily for me the group included Bob Stambaugh and Sid Simon among others.</p>
<p>I co-authored an article with Bob for the Journal in 1998. Through the years I stayed in touch with Bob. We would talk from time to time about the evolution of the industry, and we never failed to meet up for a drink or a meal at the annual IHRIM show. My contacts with Bob have been much more infrequent since I moved to Europe three years ago. Nevertheless, I was very fond of Bob and consider him to be one of my personal mentors in this business. Like many, I will miss him."(Dave Arella, Norway)</p>
<p>"I had the privilege of meeting Bob in person during an IHRIM editorial planning meeting in Florida. His unassuming avuncular manner concealed a sharp and informed wit, which he deployed humorously at appropriate moments to round off an argument or to make a telling point in debate. The scope of his learning and experience was evident.</p>
<p>His written articles in the IHRIM Journal were unfailingly interesting. I always made a point of reading his contributions before anyone else's, because of the fresh and wry perspective that he was able to offer on a range of topics. His style was very accessible. He was able to buttress his points with references to an extensive hinterland of knowledge, a fact that spoke clearly of a man who was educated in the widest sense of that word. In his "Visions of the Future" articles, I recall occasional references to the Duke of Wellington, the Bodleian library at Oxford, Buddhism, Shakespeare, Rashomon, the First World War, and the European Renaissance period – all invoked with equal ease and accustomed familiarity. Such a rounded schooling is not typically to be found in someone residing to the west of the Atlantic Ocean!</p>
<p>The Journal will not be the same without him. I will miss both his instructive business acumen and his cultural insights, and feel saddened by his passing." (Phil Jones, UK)</p>
<p>"Bob joined The Hunter Group in 1996 and together with too many others to name, helped build out our western region business. He was passionant about his profession and work, and a prolific reader who tried to bring new methods and tools to his consulting activities. I had the extreme pleasure of working closely with Bob forging a new consulting model that combined strategy with implementation. That model led THG to become the most successful HRIM consulting firms of the 90s; I attribute much of our success to Bob's view that that crafting a solution was not enough; you had to implement it to complete the job. Although Bob left THG in 1991 before much of our success occurred, his contributions remained." (Terry Hunter, US)</p>
<p>"I first met Bob in the spring of 1976. I had recently started a new job in San Francisco with Bechtel as Manager of Personnel Information Systems – “HR” wasn’t the operative terminology then! Bob was working for SRI (Stanford Research Institute) as a data analyst. SRI was performing analytical work for Bechtel’s external legal counsel that was defending the firm on a multi-year class action case that was about to come to trial. I explained, to Bob, the intricacies of the employee data that had been maintained. If you have never been involved in a class action suit, it really comes down to the statistics that can be supported. Both parties had the same data and how well it is understood and used impacts the outcome. Bob knew the data – the plaintiff’s attorneys never asked a question about it after receiving it. To make a long story short, the case involved female employees who were suing, claiming lack of promotional opportunities in the firm. The plaintiffs presented their statistics which portrayed their claims. However the plaintiffs, not really having any knowledge of the data, were ultimately claiming that employees who were terminated long ago weren’t being promoted. Duh! Bob’s analysis, not including terminated employees, proved otherwise and the case was settled out of court in a few days. This was a learning experience – you may have the data but you need to fully understand it before using it.</p>
<p>Bob and I next bumped into each other a year later, in Las Vegas, at the Information Sciences “personnel systems conference”. Bob was working with personnel systems at Crocker Bank at this time. We kept discussing how biased the presentations were, only being delivered by InSci people or their clients, with very scripted presentations. We thought based on the number of large companies in the SF/Bay Area that have personnel systems issues that some type of professional group would be attractive and valuable. Several months after our return from Las Vegas a meeting was hosted at Crocker Bank, with people from Bechtel, Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, Fireman’s Fund, Syntex, and a few others. That was the beginning of what became HRSP.</p>
<p>I was the first HRSP president – Bob was on the Board and basically jumped in to do whatever was necessary that one of the officers didn’t want to handle. For the first decade or so national conferences were hosted, designed, and executed by local chapters. These were different times as each chapter tried to do something different and better than prior conferences – this competition provided some very interesting results, many of which are still talked about today. The Los Angeles Chapter should have hosted the fourth national conference, however it was 1984 and there was another event in LA that year that was sucking up all resources – you may recall the Olympics! So the task was given to a new chapter, Dallas/Ft. Worth, and Bob became a co-chair to help that chapter get the job done as they didn’t have the experiences needed. Bob obtained many air miles traveling back and forth to DFW. It was truly a memorable conference – we nearly spent as much time at Billy Bobs as at the conference hotel – and can you imagine Bob at a dude ranch, wrestling a bull?</p>
<p>As time passed Bob and I went in different directions in the business. Aside from our common vision about the role HRSP could play in the business, Bob became a true visionary in the industry. When we started, HRIS consulting wasn’t a major part of the business. Bob had basic HRIS related jobs in a few large corporations after Crocker, however Bob saw the opportunities that were opening in the industry and jumped into and became a leader in them.</p>
<p>The Bob I first met was a slightly different Bob than I now remember. He was a smart guy, but didn’t demonstrate the brilliance he would later; he wrote a little, but not the volumes he later would be publishing; and his presentation skills were decent but vastly improved over time. There are two attributes I don’t believe ever changed – first: Bob’s wit and sense of humor were always appreciated by those who knew him well, and second: his ability to quickly grasp a new concept or idea and run with it.</p>
<p>As I look back at the original HRSP Board members, it’s difficult to realize that I am now the only remaining member still around IHRIM. Bob and I tried to locate the others and have a 25th reunion last year; however we did not succeed, so I’m not sure where they all are.</p>
<p>National conferences won’t be the same for me without Bob there. We have had the same discussion for about 15 years – which conference had the best opening, which had the best key note speaker, which had the best event, which had the best sessions, among other conference “bests”. There isn’t anyone that can take Bob’s place in those discussions or in many other areas of the industry and IHRIM. Bob will be missed; however his memory will be with me, and many others, forever." (Sid Simon, US)</p>
