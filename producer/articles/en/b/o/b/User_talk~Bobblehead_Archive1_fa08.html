<dd>My response: I think I jumped the gun and was careless and I apologize. I was editing in too many windows at once, and I thought that it was a disguised anti-immigration-bill description.

<dd>Thanks -- yes, I saw the previous one, too. BTW, I'm not happy with the previous paragraph either (about voting for Alito).

<dd>Any mediation I'm doing is more along the informal variety. Aside from communication on the article talk pages there hasn't really been any communications between the parties involved so I don't think it's quite reached the Mediation Cabal level yet. The two articles cover a topic that is rather controversial in the east <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_County%2C_Washington_c929.html" title="King County, Washington">King County, Washington</a> area and the two editors that are having the disagreement are on different sides of the issue. At this point I've counseled the editors to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, to start <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">cite their sources</a>, and keep <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> in mind while they do their edits in the hope that it'll solve some of the problems.

<dd>Just a note, Bobblehead... that's exactly what Mediation Cabal is for!&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>MedCom does formal cases and members have to be voted in, etc. MedCab, on the other hand, is a completely informal mediation. Basically, you don't have to sign up or anything, just show up, say "I'm going to try to handle this case" and do it. When you're done, just let MedCab know so they can close and archive the case page.&#160;:)</dd>

<li>There was already discussion on how the criticism is irrelevant to what the article is talking about, it criticizes it on the basis that you cant have a war on a tactic, and that there are different ideas of what terrorists are. The problem is that, as defined, it is not a war on a tactic, it is a war against people who are defined as using this tactic, and further, the definition is stated in the article along with the criminal code from which the definition is taken. The person who originally defended the inclusion of this criticism also added the perpetual war criticism, which stated that the tactic will never be gone so it will last forever. I edited it to say "To critics, such goals create a state of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_war.html" title="Perpetual war">perpetual war</a>, and have argued that groups <b>that are labeled terrorist organizations could continue to arise indefinitely</b>," which is actually a pertinent criticism to the WoT as defined. Only actual criticisms of the WoT are to be included, not criticisms of something it isnt, for instance the article on Pizza Hut might include criticisms talking about shoddy service or poor quality pizzas, but not criticisms about how Pizza Hut does not provide adequate shelter for homeless Pizzas, as the Pizza Hut isnt a homeless shelter for Pizzas but instead a restaurant.</li>
<li>Looking at the source, it for one an editorial which cites a survey, and notes itself that "The Columbia study does not conclude the White House intentionally used terror alerts to influence the president's popularity." This was not how it was portrayed, and instead it seemed to say that the study itself came to the conclusion that the Bush administration was using it to raise poll numbers. The jist of the article is that terror alerts raise awareness and concern levels, which it goes on to say is the very thing that the terrorists want. This would be a legitimate criticism, but in its current state it is not as it misrepresents what the study is saying.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The person who added these things has been bugging me in various places, and brought into question whether I should be an admin, when I am not one to begin with, and stated he beleived me to be a "sockpuppet or paid propagandist." At first I thought he might be from <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>, where I actually am an Admin, but the fact hes carrying on this joke that far makes me think hes got something else going on and came to conclude I was an admin for other reasons.

<ol>
<li>How exactly does that mean it is a <b>war against a tactic?</b> It is a war, or campaign against groups designated as terrorist groups or state sponsors of terror. And again, the name holds no more bearing than the name Pizza Hut holds on what the store actually does. Some names are well chosen and reflect what it is, some names arent. It isnt a valid criticism because it is not a war against a tactic.</li>

</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I have indeed read it, and it is not against a tactic. Its a war to try and stop people from using this tactic, you could say, but there is a difference. You literally cant have a war against a tactic, for instance one cant declare war on fundraisers, though they can seek to end fundraisers by targetting groups that do fundraisers or states that sponsor them. This is why the criticism is inevtiably irrelevant, either it is talking about how you cannot have a literal war against a tactic (something not being alleged in the first place) or you cant have a war that seeks the end of the use of a tactic, which you obviously can as shown in the fundraiser example. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 04:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are a self-identified Progressive from the Northwest, yet you make reasonable, unbiased edits to the Hong Tran article. The "Emcee" person is someone with an agenda, and that person's dozens of edits is prima facie evidence of that. I have nothing against Tran, and I have made it very clear in the talk page that I believe she is talented, accomplished, admirable, hard working, energetic about helping others, enthusiastic about public service, and a good human being. However, when "Emcee" writes that he/she believes that Tran was a more viable Democratic candidate for Senate than Cantwell, he/she demonstrates a level of bias, animus, and motivation consistent with his/her ridiculously biased edits. Note that I have only edited for NPOV, to stop "Emcee" from violating Wiki guidelines by using a partisan site as a factual source. I assume it is fairly likely that you are personally acquainted with Emcee in real life, and as friendly advice I would suggest that you tell him/her to calm down and be more reasonable in trying to advance his/her personal agenda. He/she would probably be more successful by doing so.</p>

<p>Thanks for your constructive comment. I agree. --Nottingham 13:42, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello Bobblehead,</p>
<p>In case you haven't seen -- Nottingham has been banned for 24 hours by <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">User:Snottygobble</a> for Nottingham's attacks against him and a sysop, <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">User:Rebecca</a> related to this article. I also think Nottingham's treatment of <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">User:Sdedeo</a> in the AfD discussion was clearly uncivil. I'm sad that you chose to proceed with an AfD request as a means to try to end the edit war rather than the mediation I had been seeking; assuming that it is denied (and it seems that there are a lot of users now who are in favor of keeping the article, not to mention Nottingham's latest uncivil actions discrediting his own edits/actions), we really haven't solved anything. I do appreciate the initial civility warning that you posted on Nottingham's page and your reversion of his most extreme "streamlining"; however, I'm sad that, subsequent to that, you didn't seem to be doing much to control his personal attacks on me or edits to the page. I know that you and I have different opinions of Hong Tran's notability; I am aware that we all three participated in that edit war, and all of us could have done things in a better way and used less contentious language; however, I think there were enough personally-directed comments and overtly biased edits from Nottingham in particular that it would have been better if you could have helped control and defuse the situation. You may have let it go because you felt the article should be deleted anyway, but there is a process for that that doesn't involve <a href="../../../m/a/s/WP%7EMASTODONS_6c7d.html" title="WP:MASTODONS">WP:MASTODONS</a>, and your opinions about the article don't erase the nature of his actions during the editing process. In other words, I don't think the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>I don't know how much trouble Nottingham is going to get himself in, but if he is allowed to continue to edit the article after the AfD request is closed, right now I am anticipating more difficulties. He has seemed to listen to/respect your comments to him thus far (though I think you're the only one on WP at the moment). As a step of good faith, I'm asking that you comment to him on his latest behavior, and also asking that you consider changing your position on the AfD request. I don't know that there is the ability to withdraw the nomination once it has started, but if you can recognize that the circumstances/motivations were not proper to make that request, I think that we will have a better basis for cooperative collaboration moving forward, both on this and on the WA Senate Elections page.</p>

<p>Bobblehead,</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I'm not saying I hold you responsible for Nottingham's actions, but I think we all have a communal responsibility to address problems with civility and other standards when we see them take place. My ability to do this with Nottingham was limited because I was the direct target of his attacks and had a different viewpoint; all I'm saying is that if he continues to edit the page and behave in this manner, assuming that you also are still active on the page, I hope that you will provide additional comment and restraint.</p>

Of, for goodness sake, this is ridiculous. I made no edits to the Hong Tran page after Bobblehead's suggestion, and until Emcee threw a hissy fit all over Bobblehead's AfD about too many reversions in one day. For goodness sake, there were more than 4 reversions by Emcee and me in the previous days, but it wasn't until Emcee continued violating the spirit and letter of Wikipedia guidelines that he/she chose to make a huge stink about it. For goodness sake, I had one entry on the AfD, until after muliple and multiple and multiple pleadings by Emcee that I responded to what Emcee said that was misleading.</p>
<p>My goodness, half the people on the AfD page haven't even read the original article, they have just been following Emcee's vendetta against what he perceives as a slight to his heroine Hong Tran. Amazingly, Bobblehead, a reasonable, responsible, self-proclaimed progressive is the one who had the idea for the AfD, yet Emcee has droned on and on and on about me, making me the issue. It is ironic that Emcee is using the tactics of Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, two political strategists I am pretty sure Emcee would detest.</p>
<p>I love this Emcee line "I don't know how much trouble Nottingham is going to get himself in". Oh, for goodness sake, I might have transgressed a holy law of Wikipedia! I've wasted far too much time on Wikipedia in the last week. Some weeks, like anyone else, I waste time playing bridge or backgammon or other games online. Other weeks I waste time reading blogs or newspapers from around the world. This past week I wasted my time on this insignificant article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AfD Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>As Emcee is abusing the AfD page that you created, I suggest that you or others delete his abusive remarks towards me from the page. It is quite fine with me if he posts those remarks to my User Page, or creates a new entry called "Reasons to Detest Nottingham". However, in the interest of having a proper AfD process, it would be constructive if the page was actually an AfD. A link to "Reasons to Detest Nottingham" on the AfD would probably work, so that Emcee would not be upset that his pearls of wisdom were not visible.</p>
<p>And as for Emcee, who is reading this, have a great day! You don't need Bobblehead to start that "Reasons to Detest Nottingham" entry. You can do it yourself.</p>

<p>As a courtesy, since you initated the AfD, I am in rough agreement with Dennisthe2 that the AfD should be restarted fresh. I suggest there be fresh new without making Nottingham the subject.</p>
<p>I also suggest that Emcee start a page called "Reasons Nottingham is a Bad Person" or something similar. I have no objection to that page being started or that topic being listed on my User Page.</p>
