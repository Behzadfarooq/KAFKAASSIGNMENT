<h2><span class="mw-headline">No Consensus</span></h2>
<p>Would you mind explaining what you mean by "No Consensus" with regards to the AfD decision for <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhilica_f11c.html" title="Talk:Philica">Philica</a>?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It means there's no strong consensus to either delete or keep the article, and it therefore defaults to getting kept, but there's nothing to stop it from getting nominated again (as opposed to a 'keep'-result, where the article usually should not get nominated again with the same reasoning). In this case, I'm pretty sure someone will nominate the article for deletion again pretty soon unless its notability is clearly established, since the 'keep' comments had weak reasonings behind them and the article itself doesn't back them up. - Bobet 11:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've copied your reply here in case you don't check my Talk page. Anyway, will you please be more specific on how notability is clearly established? Please do not refer me to the AfD info page -- it's <i>tres</i> ambiguous, and albeit there are tons of people handing out AfD nom's, no one seems to care about making the exact criteria obvious and clear -- just give me a brief listing <i>off the top of your head</i> the criteria you use for clearly settling AfD disputes. Also, other than being a stub, how does the article not back up the reasonings mentioned for keep? <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYosofun_9b47.html" title="User:Yosofun">Yosofun</a> 04:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Just because four people think it meets the notability requirements doesn't mean it does. I have pointed out why it doesn't meet the notability requirements. It falls under the exceptions ("price listings in product catalogues, or listings on software download sites"). As far as the validity of sources, InsidePulse is a fansite ran by fans; it doesn't qualify. At absolute positively MOST there are two web sites (and that's pushing it; IGN is really the only really reputable one) that we have found which cover the game and can be considered reputable web sites. The requirements in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> state "multiple non-trivial published works." As far as I can see, my standing as a responsible Wikipedian should hold some degree of merit against the concerns of these three or four anonymous editors who disagree with the inclusion of the tags.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 20:19, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I had looked at the review before I re-added it. It seemed to be a decent review with information not in the Wik article. I don't know any-thing else about the reviewer and aren't sure why You call him/her a spammer. But if You have a better review link, go ahead and make a switch. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 10:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't put the link in originally, so I can't vouch for the reasons it was included. I can only speak for my quick take on the review after noting that a review had been deleted. As far as names go, I don't think "Google" is a very serious sounding name - Internet names are nothing I use in making judgments about sites. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdammers_e118.html" title="User:Kdammers">Kdammers</a> 10:25, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deletion review for Yuria Kato</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Bobet. The article on <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuria_Kato_8013.html" title="Yuria Kato">Yuria Kato</a> was recently deleted per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Yuria_Kato_b8c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Yuria Kato">this discussion</a> in which no attempt was made to establish notability for her name in Japanese until my last-minute comment. Consequently, I believe crucial and pertinent information was not brought up in the discussion (including a significant presence at Japanese Amazon, and her own article on Japanese Wikipedia), and the subject was given a drastically increased appearance of non-notability due to a Google search only on her name in Roman letters. As you recently participated in a similar discussion, I thought you might want to chime in at that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_September_2#Yuria_Kato" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_September_2#Yuria_Kato" rel="nofollow">Deletion review</a> I have started on the matter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of "Category:Asian porn star" from Asian countries</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Bobet. It seems a certain <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">editor</a>, whose attempts to have articles deleted within the category of Asian porn stars have been failing of late, is now depopulating the "Category:Asian porn stars" by removing this category from each country within the category ("Category:Chinese porn stars", ""Category:Filipino porn stars", etc.). Following his usual pattern, he is instigating edit wars, and has passed the 3-revert rule on at least two of these. I am not very familiar with the protocol on this sort of thing, and would prefer to spend my limited Wikipedia time working on articles rather than fighting deletions and engaging in nonsensical arguments. Anything you can do to help, or advice you can offer will be much appreciated.

<dd>My reason is that ethnic groups like the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc, are not considered "Asian" in the UK. It would be POV to include the "Asian porn star" category in those ethnic-specific categories.

<dd>Thanks for the feedback, Bobet. Yes, I was trying to get your opinion on the matter. Actually, I can see both sides of the issue too, and think the matter is worth discussing. This is all the more reason the editor should not engage in agressive and provocative deletions and reverting rather than discussing rationally first. I might very well have been on his side on this. However, the editor engages in contradictory reasoning by claiming to remove the categories because East Asians are called "Orientals" in the UK, and then because they are U.S. citizens, not citizens of Asian countries. If the issue is nationality, not ethnicity, then what the <i>ethnicity</i> is called in the UK is a moot point. And is he claiming that China is not considered part of Asia even in the UK? And is he recommending an "Oriental porn star" category? Anyway, the by nationality/by ethnicity issue is certainly one worth debating on the talk pages, and once a consensus is arrived at, the categories should be edited accordingly. The above editor, however, often appears to shove his opinion through on articles just as he has done in this case. I certainly agree with you on the edit warring, which is why I have <i>never</i> engaged in this practise myself, unless you can consider two reverts on one page, which I did twice today, and which is the most I have ever made, "warring." In any case, simply deleting categories, and then reverting the deletions, especially in a category in which one has engaged in contentious mass deletion-nominations seems to be an attempt at provocation. That's my view on it anyway. Thanks again. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 21:34, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please assume good faith. I might say the same about your own reverts - why didn't you discuss before reverting my edit? Is that an "attempt at provocation", like you're accusing me of? Moreover, I never claimed that China is not considered part of Asia. I claimed that Chinese people are not referred to as "Asian" in the UK.

<dd>One of the articles was an opinion piece and not news reporting, I don't think the other was a high quality news report either: the people who want to include this content should be able to find information from a reliable source (for example, a notable Colombian newspaper) if they want to include the text. I don't know which Colombian paper has a good archive with a search engine, but the people who want to write the article should know where to find reliable info. Websites aren't reliable sources, less for a BLP. It seems that the main editor now understands the issue, but it concerns me that there was a previous BLP advisory from you in edit history, and he re-inserted the content nonetheless. I only happened across the article because it made a very false claim about Tourette syndrome: I'm not highly interested in writing the article myself.

<dd>It may be a popular paper, but it reads like an opinion or gossip piece rather than a journalist report, which is exactly what we have to avoid in BLPs. I honestly don't know if it's OK to use un expediente from the ministerio de justicia - I've never been clear on primary vs. secondary sources on original documents like that (per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). And, it would still behoove the fellow who wants to write the article to find a news report of the incidents, so others don't have to wade through pages of a legal expediente. I search <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Universal_f9e9.html" title="El Universal">El Universal</a>'s</i> archives when I need something on Venezuela, but I don't know which paper to search for Colombia. Again, my bigger concern is that the material continues to be inserted in spite of warnings, so I'd like to encourage the editor to just find a good report, good sources, and not deviate from them, and cite his claims: he has now admitted the Tourette claim wasn't accurate, so progress is being made. The first version I reverted was *highly* inflammatory, overwhelming the rest of the content, amounting to a smear job, and what tipped my interest was the inaccurate Tourette content. If you want to re-insert text based on the ministerio source, I won't object, but I'm really not clear if that qualifies as a primary source, which is discussed on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>Well, I fixed what I could there to at least avoid a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violation, but that article is a mess, and I hope to never have to read it again. It looks like the author has a POV. Can you please check over my work, and fix anything you see that needs attention?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Europeanization</span></h2>
<p>Yes, it is unsourced original research. How a european country can be europeanized? I suggest to change it to "westernization". Also that article says it was concerned with attacking the serfdom in Russia, while Catherine the Great was a strong proponent of serfdom. --<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 18:28, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noticed when you closed the above AfD, you did not remove the category template, "REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD". By deleting this when closing it pulls the discussion out of the category. I have deleted it from this discussion, but if you could review any other closures you have done recently and remove the tag from them it would be greatly appreicated. This is a fairly recent change. The official policy is at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDC_ad9f.html" title="WP:AFDC">WP:AFDC</a>. I have been going through the listing in each of the categories <a href="../../../a/f/d/CAT%7EAFD_7d6e.html" title="CAT:AFD">CAT:AFD</a> and removing the tag from pages that are closed and adding the approriate category code for those in the uncatagorised group.

<p>Thanks for your work on the article. However, I want to be clear on a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>You believe that <b>Yrö</b> was a typo or alternate spelling for <b>Yrjö</b>.</li>
<li>All points in the Finnish version of Wikipedia match exactly.</li>
<li>Are there any other errors my reference might have, if any?</li>

<p>Bobet, Thanks for responding to my question. My interest in the article was to assure as much accuracy as I could for the next person. It appears that you covered the most important points.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:The Fast And The Furious Poster.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not.

<dd>For everyone else who's thinking of posting this: I've watchlisted every image I've uploaded and if someone tags them with orphaned fairuse, I'll notice.

<p>I am Grant Dawson, the Senior Minister at Knox United Church in Calgary, Alberta. On behalf of our Communications and Archives Committees I put the articple on Knox United Church on Wikipedia. No copyright was compromised. Yes it is reproduced on the Knox web page (www.knoxunited.ab.ca). In fact that material on the web page is actually a reproduction of the Wikipedia material.</p>
<p>I would hope that this page can be put back into Wikipedia as soon as possible. Any concerns can be directed to myself (gdawson@knoxunited.ab.ca) or to any of the addresses listed on the Knox web site.</p>
<p>I would hope that in the future anyone removing a page would first check with those who hold the original material to inquire if permission has indeed been given for its use.</p>
