	    <p><b>Robert "Bob" Kauffman</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>) is an American former professional <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> player. A 6'8" forward/center from <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilford_College_8b88.html" title="Guilford College">Guilford College</a>, Kauffman was selected with the third pick of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_NBA_Draft_e4cb.html" title="1968 NBA Draft">1968 NBA Draft</a> by the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_SuperSonics_88de.html" title="Seattle SuperSonics">Seattle SuperSonics</a>. He played seven seasons in the <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_52b6.html" title="NBA">NBA</a> as a member of the Sonics, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bulls_cb53.html" title="Chicago Bulls">Chicago Bulls</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Clippers_fcf3.html" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Buffalo Braves</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Hawks_3a1a.html" title="Atlanta Hawks">Atlanta Hawks</a>. A three-time <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_All-Star_Game_3b1e.html" title="NBA All-Star Game">All-Star</a> (in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>), Kauffman averaged 11.5 points and 7.0 rebounds for his career. He had his finest season in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970-71_NBA_season_859d.html" title="1970-71 NBA season">1970-71</a>, when he averaged 20.4 points and 10.7 rebounds for the Braves. Kauffman was the third player taken overall in the 1968 NBA draft after Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld. This was surprising since he played at Guilford, a smaller college that did not play top-tier NCAA competition. But Kauffman proved to be a legitimate star. At 6' 8 and 240-pounds, Kauffman had the strength and athleticism to play both forward and center. His shot was accurate to 20 feet and he could muscle for points near the hoop. He was also an above-average passer and a willing defender. As a forward he reminded some of Jerry Lucas or Dave DeBusschere. The Seattle Supersonics, in their second year of existence, were 32-50 in Kauffman's rookie year. But the star prospect never started. He remained a reserve behind smaller forwards. His second year, star player/coach Lenny Wilkins traded Kauffman to Chicago for aging veteran Bob Boozer. Chicago faired a few games better that year than Seattle, but went with a smaller, quicker lineup that again featured smaller forwards. Kauffman was even deeper on Dick Motta's bench in the playoffs. The Bulls, who actually needed big man help, then traded Kauffman to the expansion Buffalo Braves. Kauffman, who could not get a chance at forward before, became the Braves' starting center, where his play reminded some of Dave Cowens or Dan Issel. He responsed with an average of 20 points, 11 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game for the season and a selection to the NBA All-Star Game. Finally with a fair opportunity, he had proven his talent. With seven-foot shot blocker Elmore Smith added in 1971, Kauffman moved back to his natural power forward spot and was again an NBA all-star. His stats remained about the same. He hit half his shots and 80% of his free throws as well. His play highlighted a second straight losing season during his time there. In 1972, coach Jack Ramsay and star rookie Bob MacAdoo arrived. The three big men , Smith, Kauffman and MacAdoo, formed a potent frontline. But the Braves were again not winners. A shakeup was needed. Kauffman had earned his third straight All-Star selection with 17.5 points, 11 rebounds and five assists per game. Despite his obvious talents, however, his all-star days would end here. Coach Ramsay traded Elmore Smith, placed MacAdoo, a natural forward, at center, and put the three-time all-star Kauffman on the bench. The Braves would start to win now, but Kauffman was again an unhappy reserve, lost in the shuffle of the new roster. So the three-time all-star was dealt to Atlanta, where was again a reserve behind lesser forwards. A disappointed Kauffman retired at that point.</p>
<p>Kauffman would later serve as General Manager and briefly as head coach of the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Pistons_5ccb.html" title="Detroit Pistons">Detroit Pistons</a> for a half-season to fill a coaching vacancy, posting a 29-29 record. He was a 32-year-old coach who had elevated a losing team. But the following season, the coaching spot was given to Dick Vitale.</p>
<p>Kauffman and his wife, Judy, had four daughters who later played college and professional basketball themselves. Their eldest daughter, Lara, played from 1989-1993 at Georgia Tech. She was an assistant coach at Georgia Tech from 1994-1996. Their second daughter, Carey, was a stand-out player at Duke University from 1991-1994. Carey Kauffman was a two-time All-ACC selection. The third daughter, Joannah Kauffman, played at Georgia Tech from 1993-1996. Their fourth daughter, Kate, played at Clayton State University from 2001-2004.</p>
