Hello Carson,

Thank you for your interest in Bob Ross and the Joy of Painting; it's a
pleasure to hear from so many of his friends! I apologize for the amount of
time it has taken to respond.

Attached you'll find a photo to use with your Bob Ross wikipedia article.
Please include the following:

"(c) Bob Ross Inc.  Reprinted with permission"

Also, in reviewing your copy about Bob, I see two small errors to correct.
(1) Bob's death was a result of Lymphoma, and (2) instead of saying "PBS"
stations you should call them "public television" stations -- PBS is only
one subcategory in the entire public television system as a whole.

Hope this has been helpful, be sure to contact us if you need more (this
time I'll be more punctual!).

Happy Painting,

Joan Kowalski
Bob Ross Co.

Subject: Request for Public Domain / Limited Copyright Image of Bob Ross

&gt; I am inquering as to if either A) a public domain photograph of Bob
&gt; Ross exists or B) a one-site use of an image of Bob Ross can be agreed
&gt; upon. I am currently working on the Bob Ross article on Wikipedia, the
&gt; largest open-source encyclopedia online, and was curious if either of
&gt; these were possible. A limited Wikipedia-only copyright can be granted
&gt; to a photo if you're concerned about the image spreading prematurely,
&gt; although a public domain image would be prefered.

<p>I'm pretty sure it was Bob Ross being parodied in the Dilbert episode Art. Dilbert, Dogbert and Ratbert were watching <i>Painting with Rusty Shanks</i> where Rusty, in a calm voice, asked viewers to paint a taupe oval, represented by an orange circle. He was eventually killed by Leonardo da Vinci's henchmen.</p>

<dd>Speaking of which, I believe Bob Ross' show was actually called "Joy of Painting II". The original "Joy of Painting" was on the air in the seventies, and featured Ross' teacher, Bill Alexander (who also talked about "happy little trees", in a heavy German accent.) I bought a DVD from the Bob Ross website, and the opening credits of the show read "Joy of Painting II". (The word "The" does not appear.)</dd>

<p>Could it be that the Roman numerals refer to the show's season? Because I have tapped a couple of episodes, and there the cpation reads "The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross XV".

<p>I removed the assertion that Bob Ross was a lifelong friend of Anthony Cumia. The first mention of Cumia in this article came from an anonymous entry stating Bob "visted Vietnam according to Anthony Cumia." This line was later moved and changed to him being a lifelong friend. As Bob was 21 years his senior, I don't see how he could have been a life-long friend. Perhaps it was just a joke. If I am wrong, please add it back and cite a source if at all possible. <a href="../../../a/r/x/User%7EArx_Fortis_c13b.html" title="User:Arx Fortis">Arx Fortis</a> 23:25, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ides that Bob Ross even knew about a tasteless "shock jock" like Anthony Cumia is extreamly hard to believe. 20:46, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Firstly, let's keep the opinions of "shock jock" Anthony Cumia to a minimum. Secondly, I was the one that added the entry about Cumia stating Ross was in the Vietnam war. He stated he met him in studio when he was very young to radio and that Ross stated he was in the Vietnam war, and then later Cumia saw an SNL bit in which Ross was a guest in a bit in which he was humorously depicted as a raving psychopath after being in the Vietnam war, as a sharp contrast to his tranquil attitude. Cumia didn't state it with the least bit of jest, but I assume a rabid OnA fan changed my entry to reflect the running "life partners" motif they have. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillridemedly_d5b5.html" title="User:Killridemedly">Killridemedly</a> 01:40, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
