<p>The article several months ago was short, but reasonably NPOV, now its full of speculation presented as fact, I'm gonna make some of the nessicary changes, but this article needs a huge cleanup. <a href="../../../s/c/v/User%7ESCVirus_5ef2.html" title="User:SCVirus">SCVirus</a> 03:29, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this section of the article only reiterates the bigotry each side has for each other and is very much distasteful.</p>
<p>This section has become little more than a respository for the addition of sneering chants and anal grafitti together with a few obscure items of little relevance. If such content stays I take it anyone can go to any article about an individual and insert whatever grafitti or football chants concerning the individual? --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamnbutter_cf1e.html" title="User:Damnbutter">Damnbutter</a> 16:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For reasons best known to themselves but reeking of sectarianism the following irrelevant, repeated and sectarian content keeps reappearing and one of it's apologists has alleged that I am guity of vandalism so for the slow learners I will point out why each section has been removed;</p>

<p>Archibad99: I think you know that this is not straight forward.

<p>Bobby Sands was an Irish Citizen, those living in Northern Ireland are born citizens of Northern Ireland, and have the birth right of either Irish or British citizenship and nationality, or both if they so choose, which has been the case since the partition of Ireland, and can be read up on clearly in both the Anglo-Irish agreement and the most recent, Good Friday Agreement.</p>
<p>On a side note, Northern Ireland is not apart of Great Britain. It is (currently) apart of the United Kindgom, along with Great Britian, and is the only section of the U.K with joint nationality in place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The nationality of over-seas British Territory be it NI or the British Virgin Islands, is British.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Only as of 2005 can someone in NI claim dual nationality or Irish. This has not been since 1922.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whether people like it or not, Bobby Sands was born into a political region of the United Kingdom, by British parents. Be it in Newtownabbey or just off the Portrush coast on a wooden boat, it still technically makes him a British citizen. He may wish to, if he pleases, claim to be Irish. But whether he likes it or not, as with every Northern Irish born citizen, they are politically British.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's about time Irish Republicans faced the facts, and that is, they are fighting a losing battle. Ireland V Britain, yea? c'mon now. Claim to be Irish and you can now as of 2005 receive an Irish passport, so everyone's a winner. But born on Northern Irish land will make you a British citizen. Please do not see this as a side-hate, but as stated previously, opinions aside, whether I like it or you like it, if you're born in Northern Ireland you are British by default.</dd>

<p>I believe if you claim to be from Northern Ireland, you are claiming to be British. Whether people like it or not, it's under rule from Britain and it likely will be for a very long time. However. If one should claim to be from Ulster, it is a more proper and certainly a lot more neutral decision, as Ulster is a province of Ireland. I see your point, bud, but I think now we all have to be a lot more precise. There is no <i>Ireland</i> anymore, it's more <i>Northern Ireland</i> or <i>The Republic of Ireland</i>. Because of the division there isn't such an Ireland anymore. However as far as my opinion stretches, <i>Ireland</i> is the Republic. I do accept however that I live on <i>The land of Ireland</i>.</p>
<p>I think we all, as Northern Irish patrons, must come to terms with facts.</p>
<p>1) We are <b>born</b> British, whether we like it or not, unless both our parents hold Irish passports.</p>
<p>2) We may live in a British political state of the UK, but we are still on the land of Ireland. If people are too stupid to see this, then a quick link to the Irish Grid System would certainly put a wobble in their chin.</p>
<p>3) We are under direct rule from London, and the only time this will change, is if devolution is restored. We wont be merging with Ireland anytime soon.</p>
<p>We all have our opinions, and we all have our desires to swing whichever way our wind blows. But essentially, Bobby Sands was born British. Perhaps include it that Bobby was born British, although didn't acknowledge this; or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Legally, all people born in Northern Ireland are dual nationals whether they like it or not. The territory is claimed by both the UK and Ireland and both countries claim all the people there as citizens, whether they like it or not. When a person born in Northern Ireland applies for an Irish passport, under Irish law they are considered an Irish citizen from birth, not from the time they apply. And even if a Northern Irish person doesn't apply, they are still considered an Irish citizen. Even Ian Paisley is an Irish citizen whether he likes it or not. A foreigner who has been resident in Northern Ireland for 5 years can choose whether to be nationalised as an Irish Citizen or a UK Citizen.

The number of people from England who settled in Ireland during the Plantation years was quite low in comparison to the population. The number of those who were also descended from Anglo-Saxons would propably be miniscule.

<p>Mal, Out of respect for the Wikipedia rules and because, despite trying, we can not find a common ground on the issue I will not be posting any more discussions on this subject. I do want to respond to your comment on "my numbers" regarding internment. Between Aug. 1971 and Dec. 1975 1,981 people were interred and of these 1,874 were Catholic (95%) (RHSlainte 02:39, 14 February 2006 (UTC)) RHSlainte</p>

<dd>RH, I wasn't disputing your figures as such - I was merely making it known that the percentage you stated was from your research, and not my own. As for your figures as presented here, regarding the number of internees, they look familiar enough and I have no reason to doubt them.</dd>

<p>This article does not seem to place Sands' life in context. There needs to be a slightly fuller description of the Troubles between 1974 and 1976 to explain (a) what was going on, and (b) why it was treated so seriously by the government. His 'Demands' whilst as a prisoner (which I have added to the main page) are ridiculously petty, but led to his death and those of a number of his comrades; and subsequently breathed life back into the terrorist campaign and led to an upsurge in the Troubles.</p>
<p>Whether his death actually achieved anything worthwhile is another matter entirely. The web-page suggests that a number of streets around the world have been named after him: an heroic memorial to a man who starved himself to death for his 'right' to wear his own clothes in prison? In Shakespeare's words, 'nothing so became his life as the leaving it': his post-mortem status arises as a touchstone as an extreme republican 'martyr', or bigot, depending on your point of view. It is at least arguable that his death, by continuing the Troubles, precluded any immediate political settlement.</p>
<p>Incidentally, all the links seem to be to be to POV web-sites.</p>

I note your attempt to turn the whole POV issue back on to me for my observations i.e by pointing out that O'Brien is an anti-republican commentator I am guilty of POV? This is a simple undisputable fact, aside from his membership of the UK Unionist party, and long career predicting IRA coups and civil wars how can you accept a pay-per-view link to an article as valid proof of anything?

Also as far as I'm aware "Ó Seachnasaigh" is the translaion provided on the Bobby Sands mural on the gable of Sinn Féin's Falls Road office.

<p>I removed the succession boxes and changed the note about his being "Baby of the House." As he was never actually an MP, he was never "Baby of the House." Notwithstanding the fact that he never took his seat (being in prison), and the fact that he died almost immediately after election, Sands did not and would not have taken the required oath of loyalty to the Queen. This disqualifies him from sitting as an MP, acting as one or claiming status as one, and disqualifies us from doing the same. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:39, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the first time I have heard the claim made that he was not an MP. Even the Speaker of the House of Commons, when he announced his death, described him as "member of this house for Fermanagh and South Tyrone".

<dd>You cannot be an MP without taking an oath to the Queen, yes? Just because Sinn Fein calls them MPs does not make it so.

<dd>No taking the oath allows one to speak and vote. But the clincher is the Returning Officer's statement - roughly "I do formally declare that the above mentioned is duly elected Member of Parliament for this constituency". i.e. They become the MP there and then. Current Sinn Féin MPs are entitled to Commons resources (and indeed some have been better "attenders" of the Commons than some former Unionist MPs!) because they have been elected. Taking the oath isn't the crucial point. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 18:58, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>According to the writer and politician Conor Cruise O'Brien (who was a strong supporter of Irish unionism and opponent of Irish republicanism), Sands became increasingly zealous in his Catholic faith and received, while on hunger strike, from a "priest in Kerry who had given him an icon of the Virigin Mary and encouraged him to take arms for his oppressed people" (in Northern Ireland) [1].</i></p>
<p>A. O'Brien is a political chameleon who has adopted a blinkered anti-republican stance since the 1970's. His opinions are not neutral and the man has been predicting civil wars and military coup for years - the external link is proof of nothing and is merely spam for one of O'Briens commercially-available-only diatribes. I suspect his "proof" if examined comes from "unnamed sources".</p>
<p>B. A visit from a priest is proof of nothing, I suspect the intention here is to paint Sands as a religious bigot which is mere wishful thinking. Sands grew up under the Stormont regime and his experience of ethnic cleansing was more incentive to resist British rule than a visit from a southern priest, be he armed with an "<i>icon of the Virigin Mary</i>" or not.</p>
<p>If someone wants to allege Sands was a zealot, provide proof not fabrications, his own writings show that he was a moderate Catholic and often critical of the church. He was a socialist after all. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamnbutter_cf1e.html" title="User:Damnbutter">Damnbutter</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/m/User_talk%7EDamnbutter_ed9a.html" title="User talk:Damnbutter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Damnbutter_36e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Damnbutter">contribs</a>) 17:41, 27 June 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Except that it's a different matter if he chooses to receive a prison visitor. At its simplest, Northern Irish politics breaks down into Catholic Republican/ Protestant Unionist; although the IRA/ Sinn Fein campaigns on a socialist ticket, it is united with elements of the Catholic church who support the main aim of complete independence. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_O%27Callaghan_2e76.html" title="Sean O'Callaghan">Sean O'Callaghan</a> has alleged that IRA members were helped by priests with safe houses and that members were sometimes blessed before going on missions.</dd>

<p>This article is repugnant. It is nothing more than an apology, a canonization for a convicted terrorist.</p>
<p>Whatever the crimes of the British government against the Irish from 12th century on--and there were many--elevating a terrorist to a saint is simply revolting.</p>
<p>This man was a leader of an organization which is responsible for more than 2,000 murders. An organization that, at its height, was considered to be the most effective terrorist organization in the world.</p>
<p>Worse than that, they made common cause with the enemies of freedom and democracy, especially Libya which supplied many of the weapons which the IRA <i>still</i> refuses to surrender.</p>
<p>As an American of both Irish and Scots-Irish descent I also find it reprehensible that so much of the IRA's money came from Americans of Irish descent.</p>

<dd>No, sir, this comment is disgusting. You offer not one scintilla of evidence for the claims you make, nor do you site one example of factual error in the article. All you have to offer are your recycled opinions about the Irish Republican movement. You have nothing new, or even interesting, to say. I always love it when armchair opponents of the I.R.A. jump up on their high horse and begin pontificating, because, almost without exception, they say something like this: "Whatever the crimes of the British government...", as though it is reasonable and proper to dismiss 800 years of oppression, murder, starvation, and constant meddling on the part of the Brits so that one may then attack the excesses of the Republicans, who have been fighting to kick the Brits out. Let's see, 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits, vs. the just over 80 years that the I.R.A. has existed, and you, in all of your wisdom decide that the 'R.A. is worse.

<dd>I support the view that this is a biased article. For a start, the begining of the article makes reference to his act of hunger strike while in prison - but fails to state why he was in prison - that he was a convicted terrorist. The start of the article is entirely positive, and sets the tone for the rest of it. Moreover, grafiti on a wall and songs at a football match are hardly evidence of the "loyalist reaction". Still further, all of the "external links" (except the BBC link that doesn't work - I will remove it) paint Bobby Sands in a positive light, ignoring the fact that he was in prison for a reason. I hope we can get some neutral reviewers in here soon to take a look at it. I'll see what I can do. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogica_1d41.html" title="User:Logica">Logica</a> 02:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

In theory, the article should not be painting anyone in a positive or negative light, just saying what they did.</dd>
<dd>To that end, then, I think it would be worth mentioning in the lead that he was in prison on a charge of possesion of firearms. It may also be worth rewording it - 'was a member of the IRA' rather than was 'an Irish republican'.

<dd>As for the rest of the article - I mean it seems fairly reasonable. Here are a few comments:
<ul>
<li>"Attempts to break the protest by brutalisation of prisoners" is a fairly confusing sentence -what on earth is meant by 'brutalisation'? Its far too vague and as such is a bit unjustified. It could mean <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_graib.html" title="Abu graib">Abu graib</a> style torture, or it could be something far less serious; at the moment its an unsupported allegation</li>
<li>The reactions section needs sourcing</li>
<li>Some of the 'citation needed' tags under the 'Political status protests' are a bit spurious</li>
<li>There is a clear difference between the IRA activites section and the political protest section, in that all of Sands' actions in the former are 'claimed' whilst all the UK's negative actions in the latter are presented as facts. Now this may well reflect the reality; I'm just pointing it out.</li>

<p>To Charles:</p>
<p>You do the same thing you accuse me of doing! <b>YOU</b> offer "not one scintilla" of evidence that Sands and the IRA were anything but terrorists.</p>
<p>How can whatever the British did whenever they did it justify walking up to a British soldier and shooting him in the head in front of his wife and children?</p>
<p>How can it justify the bombing of a bunch of old pensioners as happened in 1988* (Bono went on an impassioned, heart-felt, deeply moving denunciation of the IRA in a <i>Joshua Tree</i> concert I saw, he concluded with the statement, "Fuck the revolution!")</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the place where that atrocity occurred slips my mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is nothing can justify the IRA's violence against not only the British military or Protestants but Catholics--the very people they laughably claim to "represent."</p>
<p>They are vicious killers and should have been executed.</p>
<p>To Rodurbar:</p>
<p>There is no evidence that "torture" occurred at Abu Ghraib. What occurred was little more than Fraternity-style hazing. Unaceptable, of course, and the soldiers responsible should have been and were punished (albeit out of proportion to the offenses). But to equate frat-house hazing with the actual <i>torture</i> that occurred when Saddam's thugs ran the place is completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>The interrogation methods that were used, the "Conveyor" system, sensory deprivation, loud music, etc, are all perfectly acceptable. We are talking about saving lives by making terrorist scum a little uncomfortable, <i>not</i> torture!</p>
<p>Having said that, I applaud your effort to make this hagiographic article neither "positive" or "negative" but informative. Sands and his co-horts were swine and the world is far better place for their having gone to Hell. Kudos to Baroness Thatcher for hanging tough. (Would that Reynaldus Magnus had hung tough against the Islamofacsists in Lebanon in '82.)</p>
<p>So I hope's it's understood that my objection isn't to you personally but to false characterization that what happened at Abu Ghraib was torture.</p>
<p>To Logica:</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to defend my criticisms of the article. I don't have the time to respond to everything.</p>

<p>I actually added the mention of the unusual terseness of the announcement in the House of Commons under the misapprehension that I had earlier removed it. The announcement of the death of a Member is normally done in a very summary fashion, unless they are a particularly prominent member. However, in the case of Bobby Sands there was an even more terse announcement. The phrasing at the time was normally:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I regret to have to inform the House of the death of A. B., the Member for X, and I desire on behalf of the House to express our sense of the loss we have sustained and our sympathy with the relatives of the hon. Member.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For Bobby Sands, the sense of loss and the expression of sympathy with relatives were omitted. This was a unique occurrence and attention was drawn to it at the time by both British and Irish newspapers. It is also mentioned in "<a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/beresford.htm" class="external text" title="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/beresford.htm" rel="nofollow">Ten Men Dead</a>", the story of the hunger strike: The Speaker "pointedly failed to extend condolences to the family, which are traditionally offered by the Speaker on the death of a Member." <a href="http://www.inac.org/irishhistory/hungerstrikes/chapters/25" class="external text" title="http://www.inac.org/irishhistory/hungerstrikes/chapters/25" rel="nofollow">This book</a> on NORAID's site also mentions it.

<dd>If I were to accept that there is enough references out there for it to be classed as notable, it would need some clarification.

<dd>The Speaker of the House of Commons is not part of the British government. As I am a British citizen and a loyal monarchist I don't accept the "anti-British republicanism" description; it is simply telling the story of one man in neutral terms. As far as Notability goes, the guidelines on notability apply to whether a topic is notable enough for an article to be written about it, and should not be applied strictly to every individual concept within the article. For example, let's suppose that <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> didn't get selected for Sedgefield in 1983 and therefore stayed as a Barrister. If this were the case he would not be notable for an article (there are lots of Barristers out there; only the well-known ones are worthy of an article). However, given that he is notable for other reasons, his biography article includes his legal career. Incidentally "de trop" is in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_phrases_used_by_English_speakers_609c.html" title="List of French phrases used by English speakers">List of French phrases used by English speakers</a>.</dd>

<p>You don't seem to have gotten my point - the sentance is vague and gives the IMPRESSION to someone without a wider knowledge that it was British spite. I was pointing out that the particular pro-Republicanism that has been present in the article would thus make it more likely that this statement would be interpretted in an anti-British way, because of the very anti-British nature of this kind of Republicanism. I did not imply the statement you added was like this. Thus, repeating myself again from above, I would prefer it if you could expand the point to remove the vagueness that is attached to it, and which may give rise to an inerpretation that this occured due to British spite for Sands. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogica_1d41.html" title="User:Logica">Logica</a> 17:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Per criterion 1(c), the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">lead</a> needs expansion.</li>
<li>Per criterion 1(c), the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">lists</a> in the sections <b>Reactions</b> and <b>Published works</b> should be changed to text.</li>
<li>Per criteria 2(a) and (b), I'd suggest that as a rule of thumb, there should be at least one citation per section and subsection, most importantly in the <b>Prisoner</b> section. Also, please cite or clear the remaining citation needed tag.</li>
<li>Per criteria 3(a), though this is not absolutely essential, the article could use a little more context on the troubles, to place his life within an historical context.</li>

<p>Can anyone please clarify why <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Northern_Ireland_%28bordered%29.svg_20ee.html" title="Image:Flag of Northern Ireland (bordered).svg">Image:Flag of Northern Ireland (bordered).svg</a> is in the infobox please? Before any comments of "it's the flag of Northern Ireland" are used, I suggest you look at which articles actually use the image. Out of the plethora of Unionist politicans we have articles for barely any (if any at all) actually use the flag in their infoboxes, therefore I consider the use of it in this article to be politically motivated and suggest it be removed immediately. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 23:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In a similar vein to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Duddy_26bb.html" title="John Duddy">John Duddy</a> it should be the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_tricolour.html" title="Irish tricolour">Irish tricolour</a>.

<dd>I can't see a reason for there being a flag in this infobox at all. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubacca_3abb.html" title="User:Stubacca"><font color="green"><b>Stu</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubacca_abf2.html" title="User talk:Stubacca"><font color="green"><sup><i>’Bout ye!</i></sup></font></a> 08:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I tend to agree with you Stu - it could possibly just become a "another" point of conflict. I think the flag was recently added by an IP editor and he also add the Greenland, Palastinian and Vatican flags!! hhhmmmm!--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 09:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
