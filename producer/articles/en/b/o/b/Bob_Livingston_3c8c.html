<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Livingston_3c8c.html" title="Edit section: Career in Congress">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career in Congress</span></h2>
<p>While Livingston was serving as head of the state attorney general's organized crime unit in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, he won the Republican nomination for Louisiana's 1st Congressional District, based in the wealthy New Orleans suburbs and including a small part of the city itself. The seat had opened up when 36-year incumbent <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrat</a> and former <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Armed_Services_Committee_83c8.html" title="House Armed Services Committee">House Armed Services Committee</a> chairman <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Edward_H%C3%A9bert_2d4a.html" title="Felix Edward Hébert">F. Edward Hébert</a> retired. Livingston narrowly lost to one-term state legislator <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Alvin_Tonry_2d9e.html" title="Richard Alvin Tonry">Richard Tonry</a>. Livingston was only denied victory by the third-party candidacy of former Sixth District Congressman <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rarick_24aa.html" title="John Rarick">John Rarick</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Francisville%2C_Louisiana_6fa6.html" title="St. Francisville, Louisiana">St. Francisville</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Feliciana_Parish_7105.html" title="West Feliciana Parish">West Feliciana Parish</a>. Rarick, who had been one of the most <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> Democrats in Congress during his tenure, presumably siphoned off enough votes from Livingston to allow Tonry to win.</p>
<p>However, allegations surfaced of "tombstone" votes for Tonry in both the primary and general elections. Tonry was forced to resign in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> and lost the Democratic nomination for the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_election.html" title="Special election">special election</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> to state legislator Ron Faucheux. However, Faucheux was dogged by allegations that he was <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">gay</a>, which cost him a good deal of support in the socially conservative 1st. He also faced an independent challenge from the left. Livingston took advantage of this to become the first Republican to represent New Orleans since Reconstruction.<a href="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=32013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=32013" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He won a full term with 86 percent of the vote in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and was reelected eleven times, the last nine of those unopposed.</p>
<p>Although very well-known in Louisiana, Livingston was a relatively low-key congressman for his first eighteen years in Washington. However, he managed early in his career to land a spot on the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_Committee_on_Appropriations_59d5.html" title="U.S. House Committee on Appropriations">Appropriations Committee</a>, which allowed him to steer millions of dollars to his district. This, along with his very conservative stances on most issues, made him very popular with his constituents, most of whom had never been previously represented by a Republican. He also received many contributions from defense contractors.</p>
<p>Livingston ran for governor in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> but finished a distant third, ten points short of gaining a berth in the runoff. Two other major candidates finished even behind Livingston: then Democratic Congressman <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Tauzin_fbab.html" title="Billy Tauzin">Billy Tauzin</a> of the neighboring 3rd District and outgoing Secretary of State [[James H. "Jim" Brown.</p>
<p>Livingston endorsed his House colleague <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Roemer_e542.html" title="Buddy Roemer">Buddy Roemer</a>, then a Democrat, after the primary, but the runoff election was cancelled after Roemer's opponent, Governor <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Edwards_d6fd.html" title="Edwin Edwards">Edwin Edwards</a>, conceded the race to Roemer. It was said that then Governor Edwards wanted to face Livingston in a general election, and when that did not happen, Edwards pulled out of the second round of balloting to prevent Roemer from consolidating majority support.</p>
<p>Despite his showing in the gubernatorial race, Livingston remained highly popular in his district and went on to win easy re-elections as he moved up the leadership ladder in the House.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Livingston_3c8c.html" title="Edit section: Chairman, House Appropriations Committee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chairman, House Appropriations Committee</span></h2>
<p>Livingston first came to national attention in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, when he was named chairman of the Appropriations Committee after the Republican takeover of the House. This instantly made him one of the most powerful members of Congress. During one committee session, he brandished a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machete.html" title="Machete">machete</a> to demonstrate his seriousness as a budget-cutter.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_scandal_628b.html" title="Monica Lewinsky scandal">Monica Lewinsky scandals</a>, Livingston was one of many Republicans who demanded Clinton's resignation, and later <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a>, for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a>. After <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newt_Gingrich_8f3a.html" title="Newt Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> resigned as Speaker in part because of Republican losses in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_election%2C_1998_90a1.html" title="U.S. House election, 1998">1998 elections</a>, Livingston announced that he was not only running for Speaker but had lined up enough support to win. He was nominated as the Republican candidate for Speaker without opposition. As the Republicans had narrowly retained their majority, this effectively made him Speaker-elect.</p>

<p>Although the Republicans claimed Clinton deserved impeachment because he lied about his sexual indiscretions, many Democrats felt the indiscretions themselves were the main issue. In response, <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Hustler_Magazine_39a3.html" title="Hustler Magazine">Hustler Magazine</a></i> publisher <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Flynt_1649.html" title="Larry Flynt">Larry Flynt</a> placed an article in his magazine offering up to $1,000,000 for information on sexual indiscretions by Republican officials. Flynt received evidence that Livingston had strayed outside of his marriage and he was preparing to publish this information. Livingston got word that the article was pending. During debate over the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton_e031.html" title="Impeachment of Bill Clinton">impeachment resolution</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Livingston surprised everyone by stepping down as Speaker-elect and announced he would resign from the House in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. He was succeeded by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Vitter_f4be.html" title="David Vitter">David Vitter</a>, who later went on to become the first popularly elected Republican senator from Louisiana.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Livingston_3c8c.html" title="Edit section: Subsequent career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subsequent career</span></h2>
<p>Soon after retiring from public life he founded <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Livingston_Group_8a60.html" title="The Livingston Group">The Livingston Group</a>, one of many lobbying groups in the nation's capital.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Livingston was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnfield.html" title="Winnfield">Winnfield</a>.</p>
<p>Livingston is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux (also born 1943). They reside in Washington and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metairie%2C_Louisiana_9045.html" title="Metairie, Louisiana">Metairie</a> in <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Parish_fbed.html" title="Jefferson Parish">Jefferson Parish</a>.</p>

<p>Richard Godwin Livingston, the son of Bob and Bonnie Livingston, was killed on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, while he was trimming trees in New Orleans. Livingston (born <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>), was electrocuted in the Lakeview neighborhood when he apparently touched a wire. Emergency workers pronounced him dead at the scene.</p>
