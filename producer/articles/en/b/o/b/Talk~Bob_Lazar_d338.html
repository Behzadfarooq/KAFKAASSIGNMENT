<p>Re his arrest for working in a brothel, the article says that he installed "stereo equipment". However, I've just watched an interview with Lazar on Discovery called "UFO&#160;: Down to Earth" in which he said that he installed a computer in the brothel to make it run more efficiently.

But <i>is it</i> the <i>same</i> Bob Lazar? I wasn't sure, but Mahood's timeline <a href="http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/timeline.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/timeline.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> does mention a company by that name. So I'll amend the article with more info. It's kind of lazy of Wired to mention Lazar and forget his colourful past.

<p>I'm surprised there's no mention in this article (or the Wired article for that matter) about Bob's other claim to fame "Desert Blast" (which itself is probably a good topic for its own wikipedia article.) His activities in the pyro community and Desert Blast in particular are more likely the reason he gained the attention of the CPSA than the sales from his company. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.36.67.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.36.67.91_b59f.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.36.67.91">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Wow, yes, you're right - this guy is just a neverending story. And <i>Wired</i> has covered Desert Blast, back in 1994 - <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/desert.blast.html" class="external free" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/desert.blast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/desert.blast.html</a> (surely someone at <i>Wired</i> has enough sense to at least search their <i>own</i> archives?).

<p>Anyone have a link to show that Bob Lazar took a lie detector test and passed it? (thus verifying that he at least believes his claims). I saw the test on a TV show (the video was on Google Video, after a search for 'Robert Lazar'). I can't find something online other than the video to verify it.

<dd>We'd really need some provenance for the show; that is, we'd need to say what show it was and when it was made (otherwise we're just saying we found something on google video - we can't even really claim that it really <i>is</i> Lazar). <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddenface_dcff.html" title="User:Middenface">Middenface</a> 19:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was the news segment from Las Vegas where he was interviewed for the 2nd time. I forgot to mention, it also showed how some of his former employers denied him ever working there, even though the news was able to obtain copies of his W2's and a work record. It also showed that the hospital in which he was born in had "no record" of him ever being born, so they had to actually speak to the doctor who delivered him. It was indeed interesting, and what actually got me paying some attention to Lazar. --<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJOK3R_dbe7.html" title="User:JOK3R">JOK3R</a> 19:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just curious as to why "Robert Lazar," his full name, redirects to "Bob Lazar," and not the other way around? The bolded, initial text says "Robert Scott Lazar," and yet the article is titled differently (which is completely acceptable, but it doesn't make sense to me why the main article that others redirect to isn't titled after his real name). I'm a little hesitant to Be Bold here, since I like to assume that people have good reasons for stuff like this&#160;:) -<a href="../../../v/e/t/User%7EVetteDude_3819.html" title="User:VetteDude">VetteDude</a> 20:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just deleted the line about him pandering for prostitution and going bankrupt as it just seems to be spuriously tagged on the end of the intro, with no references.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not hard to find references for both claims. A quick Google search brought up <a href="http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/timeline.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/timeline.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and this page mentions both claims with references to newspaper articles and court documents. Nonetheless, I am not reverting your edit since his pandering charge and bankruptcy are completely out of place in the intro (and perhaps should not be included in the article). <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 14:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respectfully disagree with your edit and have removed it from the intro again. <i>Maybe</i> the fact that he has run several companies is part of his notability and should be mentioned in the intro, but I'm not so sure. The bankruptcy and pandering charge are certainly <i>not</i> appropriate for the introduction. These are not central enough to fit into a small summary of Lazar, which is the point of the intro. I doubt that visiting prostitutes is relevant in any case. Paying for sex is not an indication of "credibility issues". But if this information should go anywhere in the article, let's choose a more appropriate place than the intro. See also <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_Living_Persons_6806.html#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons">Privacy presumption</a>, although I don't know if Lazar counts as a "public figure".

<p>I agree with the removal of the line. I have therefore reserved the right to omit the following paragraph, because<br />
a) it is of insufficient biographical importance,<br />
b) it is depreciative to the subject of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 18, 1990, Lazar was convicted in Las Vegas, Nevada of pandering for an illegal prostitute, a felony. A friend of Lazar's, Gene Huff, explained that this occurred because, in a televised interview with George Knapp, Lazar had admitted developing a computerized system to increase the efficiency of the brothel.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure United Nuclear is a front-end for CIA, a fake venture (just like red mercury business was a front-end to entrap suspected atomic smugglers and terrorists in the ealry and mid-90s). The wikipedia should carry a warning that buying anything, even a radiant smile from Mr. Lazarus is a sure way to have yourself registered in national security supercomputers.</p>
<p>This guy showed top secret employment papers for Area 51 on national TV. Even the government admits those papers were genuine, they only deny there are UFOs there. Yet, he was neither executed, incarcerated for life or put into mental asylum. Not much guess to realize he struck a deal with secret services to save his life, he now acts as a honeypot to catch other dangerous lunatics. 195.70.48.242 11:02, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have edited the article with regard to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer intro explaining why Lazar is controversial.</li>
<li>More balance in text length between claims and criticism, each now presenting six paragraphs.</li>
<li>Omission of the following part, which I think is of insufficient biographical importance to the article:
<blockquote>
<p>In 1995, Gene Huff, a friend of Lazar's, wrote: "At area 51, Bob had to sign a secrecy agreement and an agreement to waive his constitutional rights." Mr. Huff continued: "The clearance he was now attaining would require perpetual monitoring of his activities and would never simply be attained and forgotten about until the next review date. After some abrupt suggestions that he honor his secrecy agreement and watch his general conduct, he and Mariani boarded a bus with blacked out windows and took a 20 to 30 minute ride down a bumpy dirt/gravel road. They arrived at a base near Papoose dry lake bed known as S4."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Omission of subjective, ill-referenced or unfounded text fragments such as:
<blockquote>
<p>*"Opinions are divided as to the reliability of Lazar's claims. Some say Lazar's story could be true; they argue that his testimony should be taken seriously and that he is the victim of a cover up by the US government. Critics argue that Lazar has made unsupported statements, has a weak grasp of the scientific principles he espouses, or has produced an elaborate hoax."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>*"These areas, according to Lazar, are inhabited by the adventurous (but to date comparatively reclusive) extraterrestrial visitors who could employ it."</p>

<p>On June 18, 1990, Lazar was convicted in Las Vegas, Nevada of pandering for an illegal prostitute, a felony.

However, United Nuclear is not suspected of any involvement in the case.
