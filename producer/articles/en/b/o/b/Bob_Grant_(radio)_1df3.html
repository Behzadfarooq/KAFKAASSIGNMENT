<p>Bob Grant graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_8473.html" title="University of Illinois">University of Illinois</a>. He began working in radio in the 1940s at the news department at <a href="../../../w/b/b/WBBM_%28AM%29_046d.html" title="WBBM (AM)">WBBM</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, as a radio personality and television talk show host at <a href="../../../k/n/x/KNX_%28AM%29_02d6.html" title="KNX (AM)">KNX</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, and as an actor. He later became sports director at <a href="../../../k/a/b/KABC_%28AM%29_09bc.html" title="KABC (AM)">KABC</a> in Los Angeles, where after some substitute appearances he inherited the talk show of early controversialist <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Pyne_ba8b.html" title="Joe Pyne">Joe Pyne</a> in 1964 and began to build a following.</p>
<p>Grant came to New York in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, where he hosted a talk show on <a href="../../../w/m/c/WMCA_5a90.html" title="WMCA">WMCA</a> as the "house conservative", distinctively out of fashion with both the times and with some <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">countercultural</a> WMCA personalities, including <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Bennett_5629.html" title="Alex Bennett">Alex Bennett</a>. His offbeat but (to some endearingly) combative style won him seven years on WMCA, with a growing and loyal audience.</p>
<p>After leaving WMCA, Grant went up the dial to New York's <a href="../../../w/o/r/WOR_%28AM%29_4dd3.html" title="WOR (AM)">WOR</a> for a time, after which he worked at <a href="../../../w/w/d/WWDB_c9c7.html" title="WWDB">WWDB</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>After returning to New York in 1984 to join talk radio powerhouse <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_%28AM%29_ed3a.html" title="WABC (AM)">WABC</a>, <i>The Bob Grant Show</i> consistently dominated the ratings in the highly competitive afternoon <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive_time.html" title="Drive time">drive time</a> slot in New York City. Reminding listeners during the daily introduction that the "program was unscripted and unrehearsed", the gravelly-voiced Grant offered a mix of insight, opinion and controversy and historical fact.</p>
<p>Grant was known for on-air attacks on public officials including <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> Governor <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Todd_Whitman_2f97.html" title="Christine Todd Whitman">Christine Todd Whitman</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> Governor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Cuomo_0832.html" title="Mario Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a>. Critics charged that Grant was an inflammatory racist, pointing out Grant's statements (in disputed contexts) describing <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> "savages" and former New York Mayor <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dinkins_3c24.html" title="David Dinkins">David Dinkins</a> as "the men's room attendant at the <a href="../../../2/1/_/21_Club_99cc.html" title="21 Club">21 Club</a>." (This appellation was made while Grant was reading the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i> on-air and saw a picture of a white dinner jacket clad Dinkins at a summer soiree on the gossip-oriented Page Six; Grant was famous for sharing his immediate first impressions over the airwaves). Grant was occasionally admonished or suspended for short periods by station management, typically with a bluster of controversial, but possibly welcome, publicity.</p>
<p>Grant's political philosophy generally followed <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_conservatism.html" title="American conservatism">American conservatism</a>, but with some lurches into <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populism.html" title="Populism">populism</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>, and unorthodoxy (such as being <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-choice.html" title="Pro-choice">pro-choice</a> and anti-<a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Desecration_Amendment_95d6.html" title="Flag Desecration Amendment">Flag Desecration Amendment</a>). As a resident of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manalapan%2C_New_Jersey_69df.html" title="Manalapan, New Jersey">Manalapan, New Jersey</a> in the mid-1990s, he considered running for statewide office, but eventually decided against it.</p>
<p>Grant's long stay at WABC ended when he was fired for a remark about the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plane_crash.html" title="Plane crash">airplane crash</a> involving <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce_a0df.html" title="United States Secretary of Commerce">Commerce Secretary</a> <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Brown_%28U.S._politician%29_893f.html" title="Ron Brown (U.S. politician)">Ron Brown</a>. Grant remarked to caller Carl Limbacher, "My hunch is [Brown] is the one survivor. I just have that hunch. Maybe it's because at heart I'm a pessimist." When Brown was found dead, many regarded Grant's comments as insensitive and his contract was terminated.<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.usa.congress/browse_frm/thread/5666fc7672b38c56/82701d96bfc8442d?lnk=st&amp;q=%22robert+gigante%22+%22bob+grant%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#82701d96bfc8442d" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.usa.congress/browse_frm/thread/5666fc7672b38c56/82701d96bfc8442d?lnk=st&amp;q=%22robert+gigante%22+%22bob+grant%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#82701d96bfc8442d" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>After being fired, Grant moved down the dial to <a href="../../../w/o/r/WOR_%28AM%29_4dd3.html" title="WOR (AM)">WOR</a> to host the same type of show in the same time slot, where he would occasionally criticize his WABC replacement <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>. In the late 1990s his show went into national syndication, in the manner of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> and other successful talkers, but few stations picked it up and it reverted to a local show. Grant's age began to show as he found it harder to gear up his rants, sometimes seeming disinterested in engaging callers. After being number one in the ratings in his former time slot at WABC, he was now regularly bested by Hannity.</p>
<p>Grant's WOR run ended on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Grant's ratings were not to blame for his departure, according to the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>, which mentioned that the decision was reached because the station's other shows had niche audiences to garner more advertising dollars <a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/58722.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/58722.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Having left his options open for "an offer he cannot refuse," Bob Grant returned to WOR in February 2006 doing one minute "Straight Ahead" commentaries, airing twice daily after news broadcasts until September 2006. Grant also appeared a couple of times as a guest on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>'s show on WABC, but no return to that station ever materialized.<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/383571p-325604c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/383571p-325604c.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> By December 2006 Grant began appearing on <a href="../../../w/f/n/WFNY-FM_d0b3.html" title="WFNY-FM">WFNY-FM</a> "Free FM" in a possible trial run for a slot on that station.<a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/carry_grant_back_to_wabc_radio_entertainment_john_mainelli.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/carry_grant_back_to_wabc_radio_entertainment_john_mainelli.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Grant_%28radio%29_1df3.html" title="Edit section: Characteristics of Grant's radio shows">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characteristics of Grant's radio shows</span></h2>
<p>Grant was known for using a number of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catchphrase.html" title="Catchphrase">catchphrases</a> on his show, such as "Fake phony fraud!", "Straight ahead", "Get off my phone!", and his closing line, "Your influence counts ... <i>use it!</i>" His opening line was used as the title of his 1996 book, <i>Let's Be Heard</i>, a title representing an abbreviated version of his original opener, "And let's be heard! Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome to another hour of the free and open exchange of ideas and opinions in the belief that as American citizens you have the right to hear, and to be heard." Before his daily monologue, Grant would ask the rhetorical question, "And what's on your mind today, hmmm?", and would sometimes call women "chickie-poos". During his WMCA years, Grant often ended his show with a blustery "Get Khadafi." On the WOR show, Grant often closed his show with the phrase, "Someone's got to say these things, it <i>has</i> to be me!"</p>
<p>Grant was known for assigning derogatory names to public officials he disliked, such as Jim "Flim-Flam" Florio, Liz "Hatchet-Face, the Face-That-Could-Stop-a-Runaway-Train" Holzmann, Jimmy "I'll-Never-Lie-To-You" Carter, Dave "The Attendant-at-the-21-Club" Dinkins, Ted "The Swimmer" Kennedy, Al "Sharpie" Sharpton, and "Jessie Jerkson". As an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a>, Grant also used several <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a> quasi-obscene phrases for those he disliked, such as calling <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Cuomo_0832.html" title="Mario Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a> "the Sfachim" or "il Supremo". It is quite a credit to his powerful influence that both Florio and Cuomo cited Grant's merciless attacks as being instrumental in costing them gubernatorial reelections.</p>
<p>About society, he would remark "It's sick out there, and getting sicker," he would intone, or "We are sliding down a slippery slope, and there's no climbing back up." Callers he disliked were not spared either, as Grant would sometimes invite them to his studio, remarking, "...so I could punch your dumb nose right down your dumb throat!" He would dryly suggest to others, "Why don't you go gargle with a cup of razor blades?"</p>
<p>A typical exchange with a caller: Grant: "Where are you from, Pal?" Caller:"Brooklyn, Bob," in a heavy accent. Grant: "No, I mean before you came to my country. Where were you born?" Caller:"I was born here in Brooklyn, Bob," accent just as pronounced. Grant: "Yeah, right, get off my phone, you creep!"</p>
<p>Listeners tuned into the show not only to hear Grant, but to hear unique callers that Grant would attract: Carl from Oyster Bay (who emerged from the radio audience to become Carl Limbacher of <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewsMax_6ae8.html" title="NewsMax">NewsMax</a>), John of Staten Island, George the Atheist, Cheryl of Spotswood, Jimmy of Brooklyn, Alex of White Plains, Dorothy of Montclair, David of Irvington (and later of Newark), Eugene of Albany, Steve of Manhattan, Bernie of the Bronx, Michael of Manhattan, Hilly of Jamaica, and Tom in the Bronx. Most renowned of all was "Vintage" Frank of Queens, whom some have labelled the "greatest caller ever in talk radio" - his quick, splenetic screeds were typified by remarks such as, "Did you see the picture of those two quasi-humanoid mutants they arrested down there, Bob Grant? That's 450 pounds of food stamps for ya!" <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1540241/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1540241/posts" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Grant occasionally made on-air reference to an ethereal <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatrice_Portinari_691c.html" title="Beatrice Portinari">Beatrice</a>-like presence à la <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante_Alighieri_bba0.html" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_73d7.html#Paradiso" title="The Divine Comedy">Paradiso</a> section in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_73d7.html" title="The Divine Comedy">The Divine Comedy</a></i>, "The Lady Josephine", to whom he constantly paid fawning obeisance. Never did he refer to her as his "wife" or "girlfriend". Listeners were mystified as to his relationship with her. Were (are) the two married? Cohabiting? Grant was never specific. His son, Jeff Grant, a traffic reporter with a different station, would call in occasionally. Grant made frequent references to the REO Diner in <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodbridge%2C_New_Jersey_127b.html" title="Woodbridge, New Jersey">Woodbridge, New Jersey</a>, his regular haunt.</p>
<p>When once asked by the caller George the Atheist whether he believed in God, Grant replied, "What if I tell you, George, that sometimes I do and sometimes I don't?" The issue was never pursued. On his July 21, 2005 broadcast, Grant, a baptized and raised <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, unequivocally stated to the same caller his opinion on the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Coming_5306.html" title="Second Coming">Second Coming</a> of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>: "He's not coming back. Look, I don't believe he's coming back. I think that's a myth and I say it. I don't trumpet it but if a person asks - and you know one thing for sure, I've been deadly honest, dead-on honest all the time I've been on the air talking to people and they ask me questions or they make a comment that elicits a response, they are going to get an honest response. It may always not be 'correct' but it's honest". For longtime listeners, this candid theological exchange was among the more memorable of Grant's entire career — a career known mostly for candor, frankness and heated passion over issues political and social, not theological.</p>

<p>Over the years, New York radio talk personality <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> has often cited Grant as an early influence, although Stern has frequently criticized him for changing his act to appease management. Grant has related being at a public appearance by Ben Stern, his teenage son Howard in tow. Ben told Grant of Howard's desire to go into radio. "I looked at this big, gawky kid and I said to him, 'Just be yourself,'" Grant recalled. Soon after Grant's firing from WABC, and before his first WOR show, Grant was a guest caller on Stern's radio show.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Beck_a946.html" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a> now uses the catchphrase "Get off my phone!" as a homage to Grant, as does <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Scharpling_e958.html" title="Tom Scharpling">Tom Scharpling</a>; similarly, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> sometimes uses Grant's phrase "Straight ahead." Grant's tradition of nasty-naming public officials would be continued by New York conservative talker <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Levin_504f.html" title="Mark Levin">Mark Levin</a>. Grant's general angry-to-resigned-to-humorous tone changes and idiosyncratic political beliefs has obviously influenced New York bred commentator <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Savage_%28commentator%29_ffb1.html" title="Michael Savage (commentator)">Michael Savage</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002, industry magazine <i><a href="../../../t/a/l/Talkers_magazine.html" title="Talkers magazine">Talkers</a></i> ranked Grant as the 16th greatest radio talk show host of all time. <a href="http://www.talkers.com/greatest/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkers.com/greatest/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
