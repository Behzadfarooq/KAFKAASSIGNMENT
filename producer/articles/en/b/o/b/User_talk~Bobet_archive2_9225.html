It has finished with the result 88/14/9, and I am promoted. I am really overwhelmed with the amount of support I have got. With some of you we have edited many articles as a team, with some I had bitter arguments in the past, some of you I consider to be living legends of Wikipedia and some nicks I in my ignorance never heard before. I love you all and I am really grateful to you.</p>
<p>If you feel I can help you or Wikipedia as a human, as an editor or with my newly acquired cleaning tools, then just ask and I will be happy to assist. If you will feel that I do not live up to your expectation and renegade on my promises, please contact me. Maybe it was not a malice but just ignorance or a short temper.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wonder if you could do me (and the community) a favour. I have somehow got into the role of 'policing' this best selling music artists list, which I know you've stumbled across before. It is regularly vandalized, or added to without people following the verifiability/sourcing guidances - which are uphelp a bit strictly on the page to avoid the anarchy that it used to be (it was nominated for deletion twice that it was so bad).</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm away from Sunday 19th March-Saturday 25th March and the page really needs to be 'looked after' by someone. To give you some idea, in the last week it has received over 90 edits, many of which have been reverted as they:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove sourced artists</li>
<li>add artists with wikipedia pages as the source</li>
<li>add unsourced artists</li>
<li>are vandalsim</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, if you would take over the 'policing' role for a week I would be eternally greatful? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:26, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That "one of the larger independently owned media websites currently on the internet." needs some citation on it actually, by what definition of larger are we using, and in reference to what? The afd it passed on a technicality (there was no consensus). The site makes money via ads so an article on a very popular website like this would increase their revenue. By advertisement the tag means it reads like an ad for 411Mania, it's not written like a neutral article about the subject. I removed the content one, the ad one I'm sort of unsure on, I think it does read more like an ad than an article but I'm not married to that tag.

I and Tyeman64 have been trying to contribute to the Wiki entry for Gamerandy.com, but I took note of the deletion notice for this entry just a few hours ago with you as the one who put it up. This is the second time I've had to deal with this. If you don't mind, please contact me on my talk page or the Gamerandy.com entry discussion section so I can sort this out and not have to deal with it again. I'm just an amateur at this so I would like to know exactly what is seen as non-notable and advertising, since the last time I didn't get much of an answer that actually helped. If you don't mind, keep your eyes on either one of those two places as I will be posting comments to see what I can do to keep it from being taken down again. And I know that I'm probably going to be linked to instructional pages as to notability for web content and things like that, and I have already looked at them, but I would like to know what in my and Tyeman64's contributions is "unwikified" and "a dead-end article" as you so said in the Articles for Deletion page and also as to what bits in the article violate what.

<p>Some time ago I was asked for an example of how AfD is a discussion and not a vote. In the future, I'll refer to this discussion as one of the best examples of that. (Liberatore, <a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">2006</a>). 12:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That wasn't a merge, Stormie just deleted everything from the page and added the redirect -- he copied none of the article into the main <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_Wars_01f9.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a> article. Now, I am wondering does the AfD decision still stand that a merger be the appropriate action for the article (so adding any of the old GuildWiki content to the Guild Wars page would not have grounds for reversion) or does this change the decision considering the lack of unanimous agreement on the AfD? <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 23:39, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. When an afd results in a merge, it mostly just means a delayed redirect with the history of the article intact, so that whoever can merge whatever they find useful (it also means that you shouldn't have a non-redirect article there, unless something has changed about the subject). There's no binding requirement to include (or exclude) anything that is in the article, since that would be impossible to enforce, and not very practical or smart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There really wasn't that much to merge in the article to begin with. I don't know if you looked at the article but the full text was "GuildWiki is a wiki dedicated to ArenaNet's Guild Wars MMORPG. It began on the 13th of May 2005. [1] All text of the wiki is under the GNU Free Documentation License. All users may edit it." The first sentence is obvious (since it's on the Guild Wars article), the 4th sentence is obvious to anyone who knows what a wiki is, the third sentence was merged but it was later removed by another editor (since it's not very relevant), and the second sentence would probably receive the same fate. There's nothing to stop you from adding it to the article if you feel it's useful, that's an editorial decision. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 10:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aye, after I left this message I looked a bit at the GuildWiki article in history and realized it was even smaller than I had remembered. I still think that particular wiki is worthy of further mention on the Guild Wars article, so I'll probably end up adding something of significant content later on.

<p>Hi, I got an edit conflict when trying to comment on that, and since you seem to have already blocked him I'm leaving it here. His edits aren't really false (read the rest of the article or do a google news search), they're just strongly worded, POV pushy and partly original research. I don't think it's a case of blatant vandalism though, but if you feel differently, just let the block stand. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 15:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
