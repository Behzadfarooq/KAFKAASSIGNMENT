<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrington%2C_Washington_acc0.html" title="Darrington, Washington">Darrington, Washington</a>, his mother, Matilda ("Tillie") Valandra, was a schoolteacher, and his father, Byron John Barker, was an electrical power foreman who died in a fall from a utility pole in 1929. Barker has a half-brother, Kent Valandra, from Matilda's subsequent remarriage. In the 1940s the family moved to <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%2C_MO_e631.html" title="Springfield, MO">Springfield, MO</a>, where Barker attended, and graduated from, Central High School. He was also in a three-piece jazz band called The Scatters in the mid 1940s.</p>
<p>Barker attended <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drury_University_2c47.html" title="Drury University">Drury College</a> (now <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drury_University_2c47.html" title="Drury University">Drury University</a>) in <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%2C_Missouri_e491.html" title="Springfield, Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a> on a basketball scholarship. He was a member of the Epsilon Beta Chapter of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Nu_cd05.html" title="Sigma Nu">Sigma Nu</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">fraternity</a> at Drury. His education was interrupted by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Barker served in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">Navy</a> as a <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_pilot.html" title="Fighter pilot">fighter pilot</a>. However, the war ended before he was assigned to a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">seagoing squadron</a>. After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summa_cum_laude.html" title="Summa cum laude">summa cum laude</a> with a degree in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>. While attending Drury, Barker worked his first "media job" at <a href="../../../k/t/t/KTTS-FM_3a9b.html" title="KTTS-FM">KTTS-FM</a> Radio in Springfield.</p>
<p>Barker left Springfield and worked at a radio station in Florida before landing another radio job in California. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> when game show producer <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Edwards_184e.html" title="Ralph Edwards">Ralph Edwards</a> happened to be listening and liked Barker's voice and style. On December 31, 1956, Barker took over hosting of the game show <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_or_Consequences_53c3.html" title="Truth or Consequences">Truth or Consequences</a></i>. The show made him a star; he was clearly a natural whose charisma and charm connected with contestants and viewers. He would host it for 18 years.</p>
<p>Bob Barker and his wife, the former Dorothy Jo Gideon, were high-school sweethearts. On their first date on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, Bob took D.J. (as he would often call her) to an <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ella_Fitzgerald_7216.html" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a> concert. They married in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. Years later, it would be Dorothy Jo (as well as Barker's mother Tillie) who inspired Bob to become an advocate of animals. D.J. died of lung cancer on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">October 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. The couple had no children. Barker never remarried after her death, saying that he's never had any desire to do so. Dorothy Jo was the love of his life and that was that. His mother Matilda (Tillie) Valandra lived with him until her death in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, after her second husband (Bob's step-father) died.</p>
<p>In October 2006, it was announced that Barker had accepted <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drury_University_2c47.html" title="Drury University">Drury University's</a> invitation to receive an honorary degree recognizing his life achievements and to speak at its May 12, 2007 commencement exercises. It will be the first honorary degree Barker has received in his lifetime <a href="http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=18256&amp;NLID=121" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=18256&amp;NLID=121" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Animal rights</span></h2>
<p>Bob Barker is well known for his work in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>. He became a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a> in 1979. That same year, he began promoting animal rights. Barker began ending each episode of <i>The Price Is Right</i> with the phrase: "Help control the pet population; have your pet <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaying_and_neutering.html" title="Spaying and neutering">spayed or neutered</a>" in 1981 and was named national spokesman for "Be Kind to Animals Week" in May of that year. On <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_Network_d385.html" title="A&amp;E Network">A&amp;E</a>'s <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">Biography</a> program, Bob credited his wife, Dorothy Jo, with him becoming more aware of animal rights and becoming a vegetarian because she had done so. Bob said that Dorothy Jo was ahead of her time in terms of animal rights. Bob took up animal rights in order to keep doing something that his recently deceased wife had done. Fellow game show hosts <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Barry_%28television%29_3443.html" title="Jack Barry (television)">Jack Barry</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Convy_f576.html" title="Bert Convy">Bert Convy</a> eventually followed Barker's lead in promoting animal rights on the air.</p>
<p>During the first ten years of <i>The Price Is Right</i>, fur coats were often featured as prizes. After Barker became involved in animal rights, he insisted that the show not offer prizes that harmed animals, a demand to which CBS agreed; animals and fur coats have not since been offered on the program. Barker also forbids the reairing of older episodes in which fur coats and live animals are offered.</p>
<p>Barker hosted the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a>/<a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Universe_b97e.html" title="Miss Universe">Universe</a> Pageants from 1967 to 1987. In 1987, he requested the removal of fur prizes and stepped down as host when those in charge of the pageant refused.</p>
<p>Bob Barker's "DJ&amp;T Foundation" has contributed millions of dollars to fund animal rescue and park facilities all over the country. He works closely with <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_White_b2de.html" title="Betty White">Betty White</a> as an advocate for animal rights.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Game Show Career</span></h2>
<p><a name="Truth_or_Consequences" id="Truth_or_Consequences"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>Truth or Consequences</i></span></h3>
<p>Barker started hosting on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, and would continue with the program until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. The idea was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts. On the show, people had to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly) before "Beulah the Buzzer" was sounded. If the contestant could not complete the "Truth" portion, there would be "Consequences," usually a zany and embarrassing stunt. In addition, during Barker's run as host, "Barker's Box" was played. Barker's Box was a box with 4 drawers in it. If a contestant was able to pick the 3 boxes with money it, they won a bonus prize.</p>
<p>In many broadcasts, the stunts on <i>Truth or Consequences</i> included a popular, but emotional, heart-wrenching surprise for a contestant, that being the reunion with a long-lost relative or with an enlisted son or daughter returning from military duty overseas, particularly Vietnam.</p>
<p><a name="The_Family_Game" id="The_Family_Game"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>The Family Game</i></span></h3>
<p>In 1967, Barker hosted the short-lived game show <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Game_3b5b.html" title="Family Game">The Family Game</a></i> for <i><a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Barris_f543.html" title="Chuck Barris">Chuck Barris</a></i>, where he would ask children contestants questions about their family's lives, and the parents had to guess how they answered in a <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newlywed_Game_3f5d.html" title="Newlywed Game">Newlywed Game</a></i>-esque fashion.</p>
<p><a name="The_Price_Is_Right" id="The_Price_Is_Right"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline"><i>The Price Is Right</i></span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">September 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Barker began his most famous assignment hosting the CBS revival of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_Is_Right_%28US_game_show%29_adfc.html" title="The Price Is Right (US game show)">The Price Is Right</a></i>. In the four decades of the CBS version, he has become far more strongly associated with the show than first host <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cullen_a5cc.html" title="Bill Cullen">Bill Cullen</a> was with the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_Is_Right_%281956_US_version%29_2952.html" title="The Price Is Right (1956 US version)">1950s–1960s original</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, Barker did what other M.C.'s almost never did: he renounced hair dye and allowed his hair to go gray. It was a shock to the studio audience because it hadn't been publicized in advance; it was a shock to the home audience because the change came in the middle of the week at that time. One home viewer famously wrote Barker a letter saying "Bob, you must have had a hell of a night last night!" The episodes with dyed hair and gray hair were, in actuality, taped several weeks apart. Fellow hosts <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Hall_d082.html" title="Monty Hall">Monty Hall</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Trebek_48f4.html" title="Alex Trebek">Alex Trebek</a> would follow Barker's decision to go to gray hair in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, <i>The Price Is Right</i> celebrated 35 consecutive years on the air. It is the longest-running game show of all time in North America and is also the longest running five-day-a-week daytime entertainment program (and only <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tonight_Show_a280.html" title="The Tonight Show">The Tonight Show</a>'</i>s 50 years on the air has surpassed it in terms of overall five-day-a-week American entertainment television programming). Overall, in daytime programming (excluding Saturday and Sunday), <i>The Price Is Right</i> is ranked sixth among the longest-continuing television programs (NBC's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Show_8f75.html" title="The Today Show">Today</a></i> ranks the longest, followed by four daytime soap operas: <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_the_World_Turns_1362.html" title="As the World Turns">As the World Turns</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_Of_Our_Lives_8499.html" title="Days Of Our Lives">Days Of Our Lives</a></i>). It has won its timeslot (11 a.m. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone_d793.html" title="North American Eastern Time Zone">Eastern</a>) for the past 25 years with its closest competitor (currently <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_View_4421.html" title="The View">The View</a></i>) normally getting about half of <i>TPIR's</i> ratings.</p>
<p>Barker has recently had success with a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a> version of <i>The Price Is Right.</i> This stemmed from the incredibly high ratings for the thirtieth anniversary show in January 2002. Since then, the prime time specials have returned in spurts for <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweeps.html" title="Sweeps">sweeps weeks</a> and on occasion when CBS's turn in the rotation occurs for the Daytime Emmy Awards, including the post-September 11 terrorist attack themed episodes honoring the different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, Navy, etc.) and public safety officers and, later, special occasions. Coincidentally, the first of the specials saluting the Armed Forces to air was the Navy, which was Barker's own branch of the military, and both CBS and RTL showed photos from Barker's own time in the Navy.</p>
<p>During the prime time shows, the prizes are more extravagant than in the daytime version, and the cash amounts are higher, with <a href="../../../p/l/i/Plinko.html" title="Plinko">Plinko</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_in_the_Bag_%28pricing_game%29_56c6.html" title="It's in the Bag (pricing game)">It's in the Bag</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Game_f56e.html" title="Grand Game">Grand Game</a> featuring higher dollar values. In the Showcase Showdown, the $10,000 bonus was replaced during the specials. In the 2002 military specials, $100,000 can be won if the players spin $1.00 in their bonus spin but was never won. Since 2003, a $1,000,000 prize can be won on the prime time version; this has yet to be won; however, there have been a few close calls.</p>

Only sportscaster <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vin_Scully_fc93.html" title="Vin Scully">Vin Scully</a>, who is four years younger than Barker, has held a job longer than Barker in the entertainment industry, albeit a seasonal job and not a daily one.</p>
<p>At age 83, Barker holds the record of being the oldest man ever to host a game show and the oldest man ever to host a weekday television program since the inception of network television. Barker is now in his fiftieth consecutive year on television (network or syndication). Barker has also hosted/appeared on a five-day-a-week television program longer than anyone else in the history of television.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legal issues</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/a/Dian_Parkinson_8163.html" title="Dian Parkinson">Dian Parkinson</a>, a prize model for <i>The Price Is Right</i> from 1975 to 1993, filed an $8 million lawsuit against Barker for sexual harassment. Barker admitted that he had sexual relations with Parkinson but stated, "As God is my witness I never asked her to do anything she didn't want to do" and that everything was indeed consensual. Parkinson declared herself no financial match to Barker and his resources and gave up her legal fight with him in 1995.</p>
<p>Barker was involved in more legal trouble with a <i>Price</i> model in 1995. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Hallstrom_a29a.html" title="Holly Hallstrom">Holly Hallstrom</a>, a model from 1977 to 1995, stated that she had gained 14 pounds due to a prescription medication and that Barker used the weight gain as an excuse to fire her, which Barker denied. Hallstrom alleged that the real reason Barker fired her was because she had refused to support Barker when Parkinson sued him for sexual harassment. Barker responded with a lawsuit for slander and libel, Barker v. Hallstrom, claiming Hallstrom was lying, but the court declared Hallstrom the prevailing party and ordered Plaintiff Barker to pay all Hallstrom's legal fees. Hallstrom countersued Barker and in October 2005 Hallstrom received a multi-million-dollar out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Since 1996, Bob Barker has been sued by six women for charges including Sexual Harassment, Racial Discrimination and Wrongful Termination (most notably by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Pennington_973c.html" title="Janice Pennington">Janice Pennington</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Bradley_3faf.html" title="Kathleen Bradley">Kathleen Bradley</a>, two other longtime and well-known models on the show).

<p>Barker's health problems started in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> after he complained of having <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_perception.html" title="Visual perception">vision</a> problems while exercising.

He soon recovered and went back to work.</p>
<p>On September 16, 1999, Barker was in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, to speak about HR 2929, the proposed legislation that would ban <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephants</a> from traveling shows. While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called "clumsiness" in his right hand. He was admitted to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_University_Hospital_a605.html" title="George Washington University Hospital">George Washington University Hospital</a> and diagnosed with a partially blocked left <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carotid_artery.html" title="Carotid artery">carotid artery</a>. Barker underwent <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carotid_endarterectomy.html" title="Carotid endarterectomy">carotid endarterectomy</a> to remove the blockage, and the procedure went well enough that he was able to return to work within the month.</p>
<p>Three years later, Barker also had two health crises after taping the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_finale.html" title="Season finale">season finale</a> on <i>The Price Is Right;</i> and while lying out on the sun, he was hospitalized again with a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>; and six weeks later, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, he underwent <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostate.html" title="Prostate">prostate</a> <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> both at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_University_Hospital_a605.html" title="George Washington University Hospital">George Washington University Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Both surgeries were successful.</p>
