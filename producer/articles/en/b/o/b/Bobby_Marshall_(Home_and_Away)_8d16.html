<p><b>Roberta 'Bobby' Marshall</b> (n√©e <b>Simpson</b>; previously <b>Morgan</b>) was a fictional character in the Australian soap opera <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_And_Away_3426.html" title="Home And Away">Home And Away</a>, played by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolle_Dickson_c628.html" title="Nicolle Dickson">Nicolle Dickson</a>.</p>
<p>Bobby was Summer Bay's original teen wildchild and tomboy. Stubborn and no-nonsense but with a cheeky attitude and warm heart, Roberta Simpson was born in secret to Morag Bellingham and Donald Fisher in 1970 and illegally adopted by the vile Al Simpson and his long-suffering wife, Doris. Only Martha Stewart knew the identity of both mother and child and only Al, Martha and Doris knew that Bobby was even adopted. With her mother dying when she was 13 and her father ending up in jail not long after, Bobby was left to stand alone in a world that seemingly hated her (even her grandparents rejected her), with Donald Fisher as its leader. Eventually, she was expelled from school and things looked very bleak.</p>
<p>However, two sources of help were soon at Bobby's aid, ex-con Ailsa Hogan and Alf Stewart, and when the Fletchers arrived in Summer Bay in 1987 and fostered Bobby, things started looking up for once. She went back to school, mellowed a little and found love with Tom and Pippa's original foster child, Frank. She came in the top 10% in her HSC and when Frank started to notice what a great girl Bobby was and finished with the scheming Roo, Bobby was in her element, with the two marrying a couple of months later and Ailsa giving Bobby a 50/50 share in the new cafe she had created - The Bayside Diner. She then found out about her adoption and after research into her past, she found out that her real parents were Morag Bellingham, a cold and manipulative woman and Donald Fisher, her former worst enemy. Whilst she despised Morag, she was embraced by Donald and the two, within a year, had formed an extremely close bond, which Bobby threw herself into on her separation with Frank (and making the success of the diner, as well as maintaining very close relationships with the Fletchers and the Stewarts, of course). She proved herself to be a good little business woman and developed into a caring, yet tough and self-aware (Bobby had lived through hardship and was no fool) pillar of the community. All that she needed now was a family of her own to provide for. She came close after getting pregnant to a married man she met through a dating agency (Chris Reynolds) but suffered a miscarriage, so fostered a seven-year-old boy, Sam Nicholls. The two became family and so when Sam's dad, Greg Marshall, arrived on the scene after tracking his son down, Bobby naturally put up a fight to keep him. But there was more: they were in love. After a few problems, notably Frank returning from America and begging Bobby for another chance (she turned him down and he departed, this time for England), the two married and Bobby, as she had always wanted, was part of a real family, with a Dad, two surrogate Mums (in the form of Pippa and Ailsa), an Uncle (Alf), a husband and a son, as well as younger siblings in the form of Pippa's foster kids and school bully Peter "Tug" O'Neale. Then she discovered Greg was cheating on her. Bobby broke down; once again she had been betrayed. But this time, she didn't let her pride and stubbornness stand in the way of true happiness and gave Greg another chance. But, three days later, Bobby was seriously injured in a freak boating accident and died, aged 23, a week later. All her life, Bobby had been fighting and when she finally had won, fate took its toll.</p>
