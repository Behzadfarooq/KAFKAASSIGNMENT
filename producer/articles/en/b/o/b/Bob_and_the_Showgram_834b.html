<p>Bob and the Showgram airs on G105, 105.1 FM <a href="../../../w/d/c/WDCG-FM_fbef.html" title="WDCG-FM">WDCG-FM</a> Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill. The show is a production of the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_Channel_Communications_80cb.html" title="Clear Channel Communications">Clear Channel Communications</a> Corporation. The broadcast studio is located in <a href="http://triangle.citysearch.com/profile/11420443/" class="external text" title="http://triangle.citysearch.com/profile/11420443/" rel="nofollow">Smoketree Tower</a> in Raleigh, NC.</p>
<p>New episodes of the show are typically aired between 6 am and 10 am on Monday through Friday with a "Best of" from the previous week on Saturday in the same timeslot. There is also a free <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">podcast</a> available called <a href="http://www.bobandtheshowgram.com/showgram_ondemand.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bobandtheshowgram.com/showgram_ondemand.html" rel="nofollow">"Bob and the Showgram On-Demand"</a> on the <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_Music_Store_86b4.html" title="ITunes Music Store">iTunes Music Store</a> and on the show's website.</p>

<p>Mike Stiles was the original co-host with Bob Dumas. At the time, the show was called "The Bob and Mike Show." In the mid nineties Mike was replaced with Madison Lane. The show was renamed "The Bob and Madison Showgram." Madison then left G105 in 2004 for another Raleigh/Clear Channel station, SUNNY 93.9 which has since been changed to 93.9 Kiss. She reportedly left over creative diffences with Bob Dumas.</p>
<p>The show also features a number of broadcast interns who have come and gone over the course of the production. In early 2006 there was an on-air competition to find a new intern after "Intern Ben" returned to his native <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. One of the more high-profile interns was referred to as "Racist Rodney" for his typical "that's racist!" reaction to statements made on the show. During the middle of 2006, another intern, "Fried Rice," joined the show. He was known for believing that he was a member of the African-American race. Racist Rodney, along with several other African-American members of the show's audience, accepted Fried Rice's self-description as an African-American. Racist Rodney and Fried Rice were best known for sticking together and speaking out for the African-American community, because they were always being subjected to racist comments from host Bob Dumas. Another interesting fact about intern Fried Rice was his blatant statements of hatred against his own Asian race. In January 2007, interns Racist Rodney and Fried Rice left the show in hopes of beginning a career in the rap/hip-hop industry. They can be found clubbing/partying in downtown Raleigh just about every weekend and often make guest appearances on the show whenever they feel that they need to put Bob Dumas in his place.{{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a>}}</p>
<p>Amy Bristle left the show in 2006, stating "personal reasons" for her departure. {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a>}}</p>
<p>A former assistant producer, nicknamed "Beans," resigned because he said he wasn't getting paid enough. {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a>}}</p>
