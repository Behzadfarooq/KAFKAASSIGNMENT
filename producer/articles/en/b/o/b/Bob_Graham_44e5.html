<p>Bob Graham was elected Governor of Florida in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> after a seven-way Democratic primary race in which he initially placed second to Robert L. Shevin. His supporters at the time dubbed themselves "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_cracker.html" title="Graham cracker">Graham crackers</a>." Graham was reelected in 1982 with 65% of the vote, defeating Republican Skip Bafalis. As governor he was probably best known for his pro-environmental policy and overseeing resumption of the Florida Death Penalty (16 people were <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_chair.html" title="Electric chair">electrocuted</a> when he was governor.)</p>

<p>Graham was then elected to the U.S. Senate in <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_election%2C_1986_8440.html" title="U.S. Senate election, 1986">1986</a>, defeating incumbent Sen. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Hawkins_fdc4.html" title="Paula Hawkins">Paula Hawkins</a> 55 to 45 percent. He was re-elected in <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_election%2C_1992_674e.html" title="U.S. Senate election, 1992">1992</a> (over <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_W._Grant_abff.html" title="James W.

<p>He has a quirky habit of keeping a detailed log of his daily activities on color-coded notebooks, which some say may have cost him a spot on past vice-presidential tickets. He keeps all of these notes in a file cabinet arranged by month and year. A great champion for his home state, Graham always kept Florida orange juice on hand in his Senate office and was rarely seen without his trademark Florida tie.</p>
<p>Early in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Graham underwent heart surgery and received an artificial replacement heart valve made from the tissue from the heart of a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holstein_%28cattle%29.html" title="Holstein (cattle)">Holstein</a> cow.</p>
<p>He cosponsored a bill to create a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director_of_National_Intelligence_441f.html" title="Director of National Intelligence">Director of National Intelligence</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Graham_44e5.html" title="Edit section: Presidential candidate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Presidential candidate</span></h3>
<p>Graham announced his candidacy for <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">2004 election</a> on the Democratic ticket on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. However, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, he announced (with polls showing him in last place among a field of ten candidates) he was ending his presidential campaign, saying he started his campaign too late and had trouble raising money. In November, he announced that he would not seek another term in the Senate.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, there was some discussion in the media that Graham might be on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_list.html" title="Short list">short list</a> of Kerry's choices for <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">vice president</a>, presumably at least in part because having Graham on the ticket could help Kerry win Florida in the presidential election. Shortly before Kerry chose Sen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edwards_8861.html" title="John Edwards">John Edwards</a>, the Kerry campaign printed "Kerry-Graham" posters and bumper stickers in case Edwards declined to be Kerry's running mate. Many wonder whether Graham's selection as a vice presidential candidate would have won Florida, and thus, the presidency, for the Democrats.</p>
<p>After teaching at Harvard University for the 2005-2006 academic year, Graham is now focused on founding two centers to train future political leaders, one at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Florida_4abc.html" title="University of Florida">University of Florida</a>--where he earned his bachelor's degree in history in 1959--and one in his hometown at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a>. The UF Center, known as the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, will be housed in the university's [College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]<a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clas.ufl.edu" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and will provide students with opportunities to train for future leadership positions, meet current policymakers and take courses in critical thinking, language learning and studies of world cultures. Over the summer of 2006, ground broke on the construction of Pugh Hall on the UF campus--funded by longtime friend of Graham, Jim Pugh, and his wife Alexis--which will house the new center.</p>
<p>Graham is also currently writing a book on civic education and how a citizen can participate in our democracy in effective ways.</p>

To this day, Bob Graham still owns a significant share of the Graham Companies, which is estimated to be worth around $10 million. To avoid a potential <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>, his various investments, including his share in the Miami Lakes development, are managed by a proxy and reported to Graham at the end of each year.
