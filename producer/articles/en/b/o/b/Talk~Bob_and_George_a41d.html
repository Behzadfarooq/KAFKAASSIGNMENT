<dd>This is, debatebly (Although I'm pretty sure it is), the first web comic to use sprites from a video game as it's form of illustration.

<p>Am I the only one who finds it a little...odd that the David Anez article redirects here, where the only information given about the author is whatever is relevant to the comic itself? What's included of him in this article makes sense, but I feel he should get his own article. As Emperorbma mentions, he started one of the first, if not the first, sprite comics, even if he didn't originally intend to do so. I feel there should also be some mention of the various subcomics and fancomics he hosts on his site somewhere.

<dd>Easy -- Dave Anez is <i>only</i> notable for his webcomic, and there isn't enough information on him to justify having a separate article for him (which would be somewhere between a sentence and a paragraph describing him as "the Bob and George guy"). Hell, even <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Kurtz_21f4.html" title="Scott Kurtz">Scott Kurtz</a> redirects to PvP, even though Kurtz is a much more notable personality. It makes sense for an article on a webcomic's author to redirect to their only notable work. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 18:28, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the recently-added line "Bob was last seen floating around an alternate universe, trying to find his way back to the Bob and George universe to exact his revenge." from Bob's character description (this is the second time I've done this). First, there's no indication that Bob was trying to exact revenge, so the line is just plain wrong. Other details are wrong (he's not floating, whether it's an 'alternate universe' is debatable, etc.); a more correct entry would be: "Bob was last seen stuck in a subspace rift".</p>
<p>However, the reason I deleted the line outright rather than make the necessary fixes is that I don't think Bob's current situation belongs on the main page; it's not a notable enough detail about his character (it merely details his position) to warrant inclusion in this section which is and should be primarily summaries, given the existance of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Bob_and_George_f693.html" title="Characters of Bob and George">Characters of Bob and George</a> page. Also, none of the other characters have their current location documented, and to document the locations of all the characters would take up more space than necessary, and not add any more details.</p>
<p>So, in summary, I think that the entries in the main article should summarize the characters' personalities and most relevant statistics only. A basic summary (as we have here) is enough to give the reader a sense of each character, which is really all that's necessary to understand their importance with respect to the topic of this article (<i>Bob and George</i>). The other details (history, current location, etc.) should stay on the more detailed <i>Characters of Bob and George</i> page.</p>
<p>Since I've reverted this twice, I figured it warranted a discussion on the talk page, in case the consensus is that I'm in the wrong. So, thoughts people?</p>

<p>Should we include them? Topman is one of the memorable moments from the 3 years of Bob and George I read in 2 hours. Should we also include Zero in the characters list? Lots of questions. - The Doorknob Thief</p>
<dl>
<dd>No to the Topman character (and other similar one-arc characters), as he was a minor character in one particular story arc, and knowledge of the character isn't necessary to understand what Bob and George is. As for Zero, I could see including him in reference to his involvement with the Cataclysm, which is an important event in the Bob and Geroge universe. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew0028_15bc.html" title="User:Matthew0028">Matthew0028</a> 02:13, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>David Anez is a big fan of Wikipedia. He says, quote, "I think Wikipedia is one of the greatest things on the internet. An online, community-run, self-correcting encyclopedia? (forget what he says at this point) I can be sitting down on the couch watching TV when suddenly I think about something, and if I want to go and look up that thing all I have to do is step over to the computer and type it in the search box, and bam, it's right there. If something is even the slightest bit notable, you'll bet you'll find an article about it." , or basically that's what he said, not 100% accurate (due to the fact that the blurb in question was too old and was deleted) but still basically it. Just thought I'd point that out, not that it needs to be added to the article. -<a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJetman123_4c7d.html" title="User:Jetman123">Jetman123</a> 17:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think all of this should be removed, after checking there is nothing missing from the list in the subarticle. Having the main cast should be enough for the parent article considering there has been a subarticle spun off from it, otherwise it defeats the entire point. Maybe some of the less commonly appearing villians should go and that part renamed Primary villians, or just the main ones (Wily, maybe 1 or 2 others) could just be combined with the main cast for the purposes of the main article. -- <a href="../../../s/f/n/User%7ESfnhltb_bab6.html" title="User:Sfnhltb">Sfnhltb</a> 02:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, the subarticle goes into far greater detail than the main one about all the charaters, so it arguably does not "defeat the point". Plus, all the secondary characters are somewhat notable, and their summaries are very short. I think removing some extraneous details that aren't necessary to understand the characters' roles in the comic would be good (I've just finished doing a little of this), though I'm not convinced that the characters should be removed from the main page entirely. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew0028_15bc.html" title="User:Matthew0028">Matthew0028</a> 21:43, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody with familiarity with the subcomics should clean up the section (i.e. not me). Specifically, the Misadventures section needs to be cleaned up and better summarized.

<p>"There exist more former Fancomics, however, since they have subsequently left the site, it is difficult to find proper information on them."</p>
<p>I doubt that this is really a true statement. The Bob and George website is archived on archive.org at many points over the past several years, and it wouldn't be difficult (though it might be time consuming) to find "proper information" on them. Somebody who wants to make this portion of the article more complete in this regards could easily check through the various archivings, and list the ones that are no longer fancomics. —<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew0028_15bc.html" title="User:Matthew0028"><span style="color:green; font-variant:small-caps">Matthew0028</span></a> 02:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm pretty sure the reason B&amp;G is down is because it was hacked. At least that's what they were saying on the B&amp;G forums (which were still up, thanks to the fact that they were on a different server). The forum member Coda (whom I gathered had something to do with site maintenance) stated it could be a few days before everything is back up. I'd post the exact text, but I haven't been able to access the forums lately either.

<li>No, they're moving to a new server. There was no hack, that was from some months ago. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuroji_5d2a.html" title="User:Kuroji">Kuroji</a> 12:32, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is probably not the best place for this, but I gotta wonder... Why is <i>Bob &amp; George</i> so popular, exactly? I genuinely don't understand. Is it because it was the first really-noticed sprite comic out there?(Despite the fact it allegedly didn't start out that way.) Is it because it has Rockman and friends? Is it because the writing is good? Or is it just a huge fluke all the way around which sparked an era of darkness while sprinkling random flickers of pure light to the comic community?(In case you're...well...<i>stupid</i>...that's a metaphore for "Caused a pantload of people to make some really heinous comics but also spawned the rare good one.") I simply do not understand. The graphics and special effects are nothing special. The writing isn't that great. The jokes are seriously hit-and-miss. And despite the fact Dave's improved over the years he's done this comic(god, I pity him and his thousand comics), he hasn't actually made a habit of using complex backgrounds, non-standard <i>PhotoShop</i> effects, or even original sprites(with some obvious exceptions).</p>
<p>So my final question to you... What...makes <i>Bob &amp; George</i> so special when there are prettier, funnier, and far, far more interesting sprite comics out there? And for the record, yes, I <i>am</i> a fan. And I genuinely don't know why. It's like subliminal advertising or something... --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Collins_3462.html" title="User:Joseph Collins">Joseph Collins</a> 08:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the lack of complex backgrounds are part of the appeal, at least. And I'm not sure where you're coming from on the "hit or miss" thing, I genuinely think it's all funny... but don't listen to me, I think <i><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexy_Losers_abdc.html" title="Sexy Losers">Sexy Losers</a></i> is stupid, also. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 10:05, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because he was the 'first.' To put it bluntly, almost everything you see in a list of things not to do in a sprite comic, it's because he did them first and was copied a billion times. BnG may be more "primitive" then other works, but it is allowed to be primitive. Because it basicly started a whole form of webcomic. Pata Hikari 04:31, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not only that, but another factor I'd say is the fact that up until the server outage, he updated every single day. In webcomics, an audience would rather look at a mediocre comic that updates every weekday than a better comic that updates only once or twice a week. Don't ask me why. With rare exceptions, I actually prefer comics that update only once a week. Checking a comic every day is too time consuming.
<ul>
<li>Remember, it wasn't the first sprite webcomic. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyKong12345_c3bd.html" title="User:ChunkyKong12345">ChunkyKong12345</a> 04:31, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
