<p><b>LUKE FROSTS LIFE STORY</b></p>
<p>(an overview of the soon coming autobiography) Luke Derek frost had an enjoyable childhood, growing up in a little village known as sedgeford, later after he left school with very little education he went on to become a professional tree surgeon. This job aspired Luke to live his life to the max, although he couldnt afford much, he managed to buy a renault 5 for his first car. A great car and bike lover he was very pleased with himself. With the Help on an ex-teacher known only as Paddy, luke started to get into car racing. Paddy encouraged Luke to modify his renault 5, so that he could enter low cc front wheel drive competitions. This was the begining of a blossiming career and also affair. Luke went on to get sponsored for his races and soon upgraded many car classes until he had hit the epitome of all classes, The super duper gt1 super max power racers class. Lukes career was very succesful and he was well renowend by all the other racers. He had the potential to become possibly the best racer this series had seen in decades. Now racing the Citreon Saxo Vtr, he was well set to race the season. But luke had other things on his mind such as Paddy, Paddy was a beast of a man, scottish infact. And throughout the many diffucult times they had endured, they had grown dependant on each over (the homoerotic parts are too explicit even to publish on the internet). This has been seen to be the reason why Luke never made it as the best racer that the series had ever seen. once the news was out that Luke was gay, he wasnt idolised by his fellow racers nomore. He lost his sponserships and also his cars, you could say his life. But he still had Paddy! and that was until he ran away with one of Lukes friends known only as Jopseph Galloso, a small spanish boy, who had been in a prevoius relation ship with a russian lad known only as dimi.</p>
