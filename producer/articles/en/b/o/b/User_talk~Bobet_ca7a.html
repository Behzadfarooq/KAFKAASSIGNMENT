	    <p>HI Bobet, I dont know if im putting this msg in the right place. Ive fairly new to wikipedia. This is in regards to deleting something from a page on the Korean film "The Host". I deleted that two foreigners were deported for working illegally in that film. Yes there was a news article about that, and maybe thats where you are getting your information. But that news articles is wrong. The reason I know this is because Im David Anselmo and I was not deported. Nor did I have an illegal work visa. So I will re edit the page again, but this time only take out my name from the post. Please respond. Im curious about your opinion on the matter. And if this msg is in the wrong place. I do apologize as Im not to familiar with this site. Thank you</p>

<p>I gave the image a category for reasons that might become clearer upon viewing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Category%7EMarquesas_Islands_a8a6.html" title="Category:Marquesas Islands">Category:Marquesas Islands</a>... I feel fairly strongly that once a Wikipedia user finally discovers the "categories" field of articles, that categorizing images [properly, not frivolously] serves an equally important rôle as that of categorizing articles does. [If you didn't catch it in there, I tried to rather pointedly say that the vast majority of Wikipedia users don't even realize that categories exist, much less understand their importance...which is why I argue so strongly against deleting navigational templates...] That said, if the sole reason the image was tagged as it was is because of what I did, perhaps I need a bit of an education. As far as I'm aware, the image is not actually duplicated into the en: imagespace by the simple addition of a category--I was under the impression that a simple pointer was entered into the language-specific imagespace that loaded the image from wmediaspace. If it were not so, I fail to see how it's possible that I could have edited the image's description field at all, w/in en:imagespace, since I did nothing to copy the image thereto, other than to insert a wikilink for it in <a href="../../../e/i/a/Eiao.html" title="Eiao">Eiao</a>...which produced the map from wmediaspace, and when I clicked on it, showed it as being w/in en:imagespace. Did I miss a tutorial somewhere? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a commons acct, unsurprisingly, with the same username as my en: and multiple other language wp [and even memory-alpha] accounts. What I'm saying is that just because an image is catted as for the Marquesas Islands on the Commons doesn't trickle down to a similar categorization on en:. I addressed my perspective on this on WP:ANI, now that I think I fully understand your gripe. Anyhoo, for now, at 3:03 AM, I need to get to bed.

<dd>I replied at AN/I, copying your reply on my talk page because it imparts additional useful info not in your AN/I reply. Hopefully a few more people will see it.</dd>
<dd>Also, Merope was right. I asked him (I hate not knowing people's genders online when referring to them in the 3rd person) to help me rollback, since he'd done a few, but he said he wasn't sure if he was doing the right thing. I understood his reluctance, but especially with Gimmetrow's reasoning "Many of the blank ones have history that may be worth saving." and Grandmasterka's assistance and rebuke "It's disruptive to mark a lot of images as "corrupt or missing" when this is clearly not the case.", I felt it would be prudent for me to finish the task.</dd>
<dd>I thought of adding that to AN/I instead of here, but I realized that it'd tip my response over into "Way too wordy to read".&#160;:) It's already that, but sadly I never learned how to put <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elements_of_Style_1107.html" title="The Elements of Style">Strunk's</a> "Omit needless words!" to practical use.</dd>
<dd>Thank you again for not whaling on me once you realized it was an honest mistake on my part. While I know some people's Wikistress is high, this experience with my first major screw-up has so far been positive, and reminds me of "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn."

<p>Thanks for your note on my Talk page. It does help to understand what has happened here.</p>
<p>I note from a glance at Udseiq's list of contributions that all 113 were made in the space of 41 minutes on the same day; an edit rate of one per 22 seconds. So he/she could not possibly have edited each one after looking at the page and forming a judgement. There is also a warning placed on his Talk page by an administrator for edits other than the Chevaline one, suggesting that Udseiq's motives or methods were less than correct.</p>
<p>I'm not accustomed to my good faith, my honesty, or my integrity being challenged by someone who doesn't know me or has not bothered himself/herself with reading what I'd written. Be in no doubt; if I could identify Udseig's real name and address I would issue a writ for damages in the UK High Court alleging libel. Perhaps when he/she is hit hard in the wallet will he/she learn to behave better.</p>
<p>BTW, the photographer of the Chevaline shot is also the copyright holder, is a good friend of mine, who I meet face-to-face ocassionally, who gave permission for his copyright to be used on Wikipedia on the understanding that its subsequent use elsewhere was permissable provided he was acknowleded as the photographer, in the usual manner. The image file made that crystal clear to readers. Chris Gibson's photographs are frequently pillaged by others without consent or acknowledgement, and on this ocassion he was very pleased to be asked for his consent, that was freely given. If we (at Wikipedia) then raise nitpicking objections in the face of such generosity, then Wikipedia will not deserve to survive and prosper. A more sensible use of Udseiq's time would be to correct those licence tags that do not meet his exacting standards, rather than disrupt the work, and waste the time of others who prefer to spend their time creatively, adding value to Wikipedia. In that way Udseiq might actually make some friends. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian.Burnell_53e7.html" title="User:Brian.Burnell">Brian.Burnell</a> 11:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I made an error regarding the Commons images that Udsieq nominated for CSD, I agree from looking at <a href="../../../u/d/s/User_talk%7EUdsieq_8763.html#Image:Chrissawyerlocomotion.jpg" title="User talk:Udsieq">some of the comments</a> about the other images nominated for deletion that discussion if the uploader is still active, changing it to the relevant copyright template, or making a least a minimal effort to find a missing source or add an appropriate fair use reasoning is far more beneficial for Wikipedia than just deleting the image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even disregarding the arguable incivility of some of these actions, I argue that it degrades the project if the following are deleted: an image which would qualify for fair use if a sentence of reasoning is added, an image has the incorrect copyright tag, an image where the uploader is still active and you can ask him/her to do the legwork on adding source etc. info. It's better to do any of these things before just nominating for deletion. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGotyear_5878.html" title="User:Gotyear">Gotyear</a> 13:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Replying here since there are comments from two people:</dd>
<dd>The images I've looked at by now have all qualified per csd i2. I generally agree that if an image is obviously fair use, such as an album or a dvd cover, it's easy to tag it properly, however if someone just tags those with gfdl or some other random tag, it becomes another issue (I've seen those too).</dd>
<dd>Usually people contact the image uploaders when they tag one of their images with something that would eventually lead to its deletion, but simply waiting for a reply before tagging isn't always a feasible option (since one would have to write down all of the image names they are planning to tag, along with the dates that they contacted the uploader etc.). Since images can be undeleted now, if someone replies late, no lasting harm is usually done. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 13:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bobet, since you did the same for Jesus Christ Superstar, I've got one article move that should go to a page which is a redirect. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_%281924_film%29_1779.html" title="Peter Pan (1924 film)">Peter Pan (1924 film)</a> has to be moved to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_%28film%29_ce52.html" title="Peter Pan (film)">Peter Pan (film)</a>, since there is no earlier film version. I have cleared all links from the redirect page, excepet for 2 that should be pointing there. As soon as you clear the page and do the move, I will also fix all links to (1924 film) to point to (film). I would be greatful to learn how a redirect page is cleared (I thought it had to be marked and submited someplace). <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> 15:50, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it was just pointed out to me that I have misunderstood the guidelines and earlier versions must not be the (film) name necessarily. So this move doesn't really need to be done.

<dd>So which fact did I turn into fiction? I told you to edit some page that isn't an archive so that people would actually see your random rants. The point of the archive pages is to contain discussions that have already happened, they don't document who was 'right' or 'wrong' in an argument or really have anything on which you should need to comment. If you've something more to say, add a new thread in the main (non-archive) pages. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 11:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Normally, I would have thought the same thing. However, at DRV closing message was "Deletion endorced -- currently in userspace". Doesn't that mean that it should be moved back to the mainspace eventually? Correct me if I'm wrong, because that sure seems the case. (And I know that that is not what normally goes on, yesterday another person asked it and I told them to take it to DRV, before I got your message.) <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 15:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bobet, thank you for taking the time to look into the AfD for <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Keith_Arbuthnot%2C_8th_Baronet_728f.html" title="Sir Keith Arbuthnot, 8th Baronet">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sir_Keith_Arbuthnot%2C_8th_Baronet</a>.

<p>could you explain that a bit better - do you mean it's ok to use just [[foo in film|foo]] if there's no other date, but not April 9, [[foo in film|foo]] or [[April 9]], [[foo in film|foo]]. I've seen variations on the themes used in infoboxes and in articles; is there any set guideline? <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 21:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC) p.s. examples - <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Corner_in_Wheat_2f0e.html" title="A Corner in Wheat">A Corner in Wheat</a> - infobox dated way #2; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cowboy_Millionaire_4a11.html" title="The Cowboy Millionaire">The Cowboy Millionaire</a> - just year in article.<a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 21:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you mean, but I'll go back and revert - some of them were in infoboxes and some were in the articles. I'll try to get the info in the articles. There's some that are just single dates, so I'll have to look those over before reverting.

<p>Hi, Bobet. Thank you for taking care of the history merge and "move back" for <a href="../../../e/r/c/Ercole_d%27Este_I_a25d.html" title="Ercole d'Este I">Ercole d'Este I</a>. And, yes, I agree, figuring out for sure what the "correct" name should be, is secondary to remedying the situation of having two existing articles which were near duplicates, but had disjoint histories due to the cut and paste. Now that you've got us back "on track", hopefully any interested editors can discuss best naming options according to Wikipedia conventions and/or precedents, and can make any subsequent move with the use of the move tab.

<p>Hey, I saw your revisions to the <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payphone.html" title="Payphone">Payphone</a> article, and agree with most of your link removals, as several of the accumulated links on the page did appear to be spam. However, I'm not sure why you deleted this line:</p>
<p>*** [http://www.yapl.org/ YAPL: Yet Another Payphone List]</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, YAPL is in the same boat as the other payphone directory links that you left on the page. I added YAPL to the list yesterday, and although I'm not affiliated with the site in any way, I remembered the website upon viewing the other links in the article and felt it would be appropriate to add it. Please let me know if I missed something. Thanks, <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Joyce_082b.html" title="User:Alan Joyce">Alan Joyce</a> 04:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I can understand how the link would have appeared redundant (especially considering the name), but I'm going to go ahead and add it back in, as the website does have some features that the other directories are lacking, and could be useful as an additional resource.

<p>OK this is fine but just wondering that why if the south and north korea is such an issue that ther eis only the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_Korea_0366.html" title="Cinema of Korea">Cinema of Korea</a> article? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sup> 22:58, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't mean cinema of the korean language I meant seperate Cinema of South Korea and Cinema of North Korea pages - other countries which have had different regimes like Russia has seperate pages for each of the periods e.g Cinema of the Russian empire pre 1917. I just though it might be politically more correct <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sup> 23:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC) e.g Cinema of Korea would cover up until when the country split in two <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sup> 23:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The thing is I am trying to make everything as politically correct as possible. Myself and other users such as Hoverfish for instance have been recategorizing German films as relative to the period e.g Category:West German films etc. Otherwise the naming is redundant for the time period. If the article is detailed enough and is valid for decent seperate articles of their own I would strongly advise it. Cinema of Korea would cover up to about 1950? (is it my knowledge of histroy isn't fantastic on the far east) at the end of the article there would be links following then to Cinema of Sotuh Korea and Cinema of North Korea sound good? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sup> 23:22, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thats what I thought -it may also encourage development of the respective cinemas after 1955 -really at present it is like Ukrainian cinema still being part of Cinema of Russia when they have long been seperate <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="darkblue"><i><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="purple"><b>"Expecting you"</b></font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_156a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="Grey"><b>Contribs</b></font></font></a></sup> 23:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
