Indian Bob Johnson - <i><a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_card.html" title="Baseball card">Play Ball</a></i> baseball card, 1939 Series #097</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../p/r/y/Pryor_Creek%2C_Oklahoma_6763.html" title="Pryor Creek, Oklahoma">Pryor Creek, Oklahoma</a>, Johnson grew up in <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma%2C_Washington_361e.html" title="Tacoma, Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a> and thereafter made the city his home. His nickname was derived from his lineage, which was one-quarter <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. Due to the abundance of quality outfielders in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he didn't reach the major leagues until he was 27. He joined the Athletics in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933_in_baseball.html" title="1933 in baseball">1933</a>, replacing <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Simmons_f8ec.html" title="Al Simmons">Al Simmons</a>, who had been traded to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. Philadelphia had won three straight pennants from 1929-31, but after a second-place finish in 1932 owner-manager <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Mack_%28baseball%29_9d38.html" title="Connie Mack (baseball)">Connie Mack</a> began gradually dealing away most of his star players in order to keep the club afloat financially during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. As a rookie Johnson hit .290 with 20 home runs, 103 runs and 93 RBI, and was second in the AL with 44 <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubles</a>. But the team ended the season in third place; their 79-72 record was their last winning season until 1947, and they would occupy last place in six of Johnson's ten seasons, along with two seventh-place finishes. Catcher <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Cochrane_04f8.html" title="Mickey Cochrane">Mickey Cochrane</a> and pitcher <a href="../../../l/e/f/Lefty_Grove_c286.html" title="Lefty Grove">Lefty Grove</a> were traded in December 1933, speeding the team's decline.</p>
<p>Johnson took full advantage of playing in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Mack_Stadium_fe47.html" title="Connie Mack Stadium">Shibe Park</a>, which had long been a decidedly friendly environment for right-handed hitters such as Simmons and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Foxx_a70e.html" title="Jimmie Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934_in_baseball.html" title="1934 in baseball">1934</a> Johnson improved his average to .307, including a 26-game <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitting_streak.html" title="Hitting streak">hitting streak</a>, and added a career-high 34 home runs along with 111 runs and 92 RBI; he also led the league with 17 assists. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a> he tied an AL record by going 6-for-6 with two home runs and a double. In 1935 he made his first <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> team, had 103 runs and 109 RBI, and finished fourth in the AL in home runs (28) for the third straight year. Foxx and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Cramer_46da.html" title="Doc Cramer">Doc Cramer</a> were traded in late 1935, and over the next several years Johnson provided solid and consistent offensive production as the A's remained mired at the bottom of the league. He was among the league's top ten home run hitters in every season through 1941, joining <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gehrig_2b64.html" title="Lou Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Ott_e168.html" title="Mel Ott">Mel Ott</a> and Foxx as the fifth player to have nine straight 20-HR campaigns. He also drove in over 100 runs in each year through 1941, scoring over 110 in 1938 and 1939; he was again an All-Star each year from 1938 through 1940. He set an AL record by driving in six runs in the first inning with a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_slam_%28baseball%29.html" title="Grand slam (baseball)">grand slam</a> and a double off White Sox pitcher <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Stratton_a87f.html" title="Monty Stratton">Monty Stratton</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">August 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937_in_baseball.html" title="1937 in baseball">1937</a>; then, in an 8–3 victory over the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">St. Louis Browns</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938_in_baseball.html" title="1938 in baseball">1938</a>, he drove in all the runs with three home runs and a single. That year, playing primarily in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_fielder.html" title="Center fielder">center field</a>, he again led the AL with 21 assists.</p>
<p>After hitting .306 and .313 in 1937 and 1938, Johnson posted a career-high mark of .338 in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939_in_baseball.html" title="1939 in baseball">1939</a> – third in the AL behind <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_DiMaggio_29be.html" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> (.381) and Foxx (.360) – and placed eighth in the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">MVP</a> voting; he was also third in the AL with 114 RBI. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942_in_baseball.html" title="1942 in baseball">1942</a>, his last season with the Athletics, he made his fifth All-Star team and broke Foxx's team record of 975 career runs; his final total of 997 remained the club record until <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rickey_Henderson_b963.html" title="Rickey Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a> broke it in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_baseball.html" title="1993 in baseball">1993</a>. Johnson left the Athletics ranking second in franchise history to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Dykes_44f4.html" title="Jimmy Dykes">Jimmy Dykes</a> in games (1459) and <a href="../../../a/t/_/At_bat.html" title="At bat">at bats</a> (5428); second to Simmons in total bases (2824); second to Foxx in home runs (252); and third behind Simmons and Foxx in <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">hits</a> (1617) and RBI (1040). He led the Athletics in RBI in each of his last seven seasons there following Foxx's departure.</p>
<p>In March 1943, after complaining that he was underappreciated, Johnson was traded at his request to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Washington Senators</a> for outfielder <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Estalella_%28baseball_outfielder%29_9319.html" title="Bobby Estalella (baseball outfielder)">Bobby Estalella</a> and cash. He thrived in his first pennant race in years as Washington finished in second place, the second and last time he would be on a winning team. His veteran leadership was invaluable to the team, as despite posting career <i>lows</i> in nearly every offensive category – a .265 batting average, .400 slugging average, 7 home runs, 63 RBI, 65 runs, 116 hits, 22 doubles, 117 games and 438 at bats – he placed fifth in the MVP balloting (the highest finish of his career) and was again an All-Star. The decline in his offensive statistics is partially attributable to moving from hitter-friendly Shibe Park to cavernous <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffith_Stadium_0f48.html" title="Griffith Stadium">Griffith Stadium</a>; but as he didn't even lead his own team in any category, the respect suggested by the MVP vote is remarkable.</p>
<p>At the end of the 1943 season, his contract was purchased by the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, a deal Washington owner <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Griffith_a777.html" title="Clark Griffith">Clark Griffith</a> later described as his worst ever. At 38, Johnson had an excellent <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944_in_baseball.html" title="1944 in baseball">1944</a> season for the Sox, collecting 106 RBI and 106 runs (both second in the league) in 144 games and leading the AL with a .431 <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_base_percentage.html" title="On base percentage">on base percentage</a>. He <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitting_for_the_cycle.html" title="Hitting for the cycle">hit for the cycle</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">July 6</a>, came in third in the batting race with a .324 average (behind <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Boudreau_445c.html" title="Lou Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a>, .327, and teammate <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Doerr_3007.html" title="Bobby Doerr">Bobby Doerr</a>, .325), lost the slugging title to Doerr by a fraction of a point, and was tenth in the MVP voting. He was named to the All-Star team in both 1944 and 1945, although the 1945 All-Star game was not played due to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> travel restrictions. With numerous players returning to the major leagues from military service, he retired at the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_baseball.html" title="1945 in baseball">1945</a> season after hitting .280 with 12 HRs and 74 RBI.</p>
<p>Johnson compiled a .296 career batting average with 2051 hits, 396 doubles, 95 <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_%28baseball%29.html" title="Triple (baseball)">triples</a> and 96 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a> in 1863 games. His 1592 games in left field then put him behind only <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose_Goslin_92c7.html" title="Goose Goslin">Goose Goslin</a> (1949) and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Veach_0d8f.html" title="Bobby Veach">Bobby Veach</a> (1671) in AL history. Many modern baseball fans are unfamiliar with Johnson, but he posted excellent totals in 13 years before quietly retiring. After leaving the major leagues, he spent five more seasons in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor leagues</a> managing and playing for the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma_Tigers_1ee2.html" title="Tacoma Tigers">Tacoma Tigers</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_International_League_e58c.html" title="Western International League">Western International League</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_sports.html" title="1964 in sports">1964</a>, Johnson was inducted into the <a href="http://washingtonsportshalloffame.com/baseball.htm" class="external text" title="http://washingtonsportshalloffame.com/baseball.htm" rel="nofollow">State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame</a>. He died in Tacoma of heart failure at age 76. He was honored by the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Baseball_Wall_of_Fame_008c.html" title="Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame">Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_baseball.html" title="1989 in baseball">1989</a>.</p>

<li>Bob Carroll commented on this phenomenon in his 1985 article for the <i>National Pastime</i> ("For the Hall of Fame: Twelve Good Men"). "Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds," wrote Carroll, "but it can also make certain ballplayers nigh unto invisible. Indian Bob Johnson never had one of those super seasons that make everyone sit up and whistle. While phenoms came, collected their MVP trophies, and faded, he just kept plodding along hitting .300, with a couple dozen homers and a hundred ribbies year after year...like a guy punching a time clock." – <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a>, in <i>Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?</i> (Fireside, 1995).</li>
