<p>I worked with Bob for three years and have factual, non-inflammatory, non-controversial facts to add (and one to correct) and yet there's no way to do that when it's locked like this!</p>
<p>Doesn't "locking" pages defeat the whole purpose of the "masses" agreeing on the real truth? Why does Wikipedia even allow this? They let anybody simply post their slanted version of things, then allow them to lock it... this seems totally against the Wikipedia concept.</p>
<p>Again, why is this locked??!?! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SlappyMcB (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlappyMcB_30fd.html" title="User talk:SlappyMcB">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SlappyMcB_e2ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/SlappyMcB">contribs</a>) 03:48 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small> ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 04:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sometimes a Wikipedia page becomes the target of heavy vandalism, especially by anonymous (IP) users, so that the page has to be protected to reduce the vandalism to a manageable level. At this level of protection, users who have been registered for four days or less are also restricted from editing. The reason for that is that sometimes anonymous users, finding that a page is protected against anons, will create a throwaway account <i>solely</i> for the purpose of vandalizing a page. If you can wait four days and make a few productive edits, then you will be able to edit this page. ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 03:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a page is popular enough to attract vandals, then it is popular enough to attract non-vandals as well who will remove it. You responded to my post within 10 minutes of my making it, for example. That's the reason for the success of "Wikipedia" and why it generally contains truthful, useful information: people who actually know a given topic or have first-person information to contribute can quickly add it. These people have "lives" and don't care to sit around waiting to audition for the right to edit some topic. So when you lock a page to allow only Wikipedia "nerds" to edit (no offense...), you're limiting it to a subset that especially in this case are most likely <i>not</i> to have any useful, first-person information. That's completely self-defeating! And in my case I had tried to make a "throwaway" nick for the sole purpose of trying to contribute useful information! I can't be the only one out there. I believe you self-appointed elite group, whoever you are, should really rethink your position on locking this page. Limiting contributions to just a select few, especially for non-political or controversial pages like this, is simply not the idea behind the Wikipedia concept! SlappyMcB 17:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No offense taken. You should realize that the protection is for the sake of improving Wikipedia by limiting the amount of vandalism found on a page. The subset of users to which you refer really constitutes the vast majority of registered users and cannot be considered the “elite.” The only registered users who are prohibited from editing a page such as this are those users who have been registered for less than four days. That does not seem unreasonable, I think. ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 17:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>took this out, didn't seem to make sense here...&#160;: Six years ago, I was at the the bar, and some girl ask me ""will you go out with me". I said "That's low"' and I walked out.

<p>Hi, my name is Joe, I started the Church of Saget.</p>
<p>It is indeed a fansite, although I agree it is not your typical fansite. The reason I started the church is because I am a huge fan of him. Also, while there are probably other fansites out there, I belive I am the only one willing to buy a domain to host it.</p>
<p>If anything, his official website should be added to the list, it is thebobsaget.com.</p>

<dd>i am not saying to censor wikipedia, but does the quote need to be on this page? cant it be on the half baked page instead? there is already mention that he used vulgar language and the movie name, i dont see how the quote adds to the article, nor do i see how removing it would hurt the article. (which is the profanity rules guideline). plus the article does not display a warning, like it should if it does keep this quote. <a href="../../../m/8/g/User%7EM8gen_a7cd.html" title="User:M8gen">M8gen</a> 04:22, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No articles display warnings per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_disclaimer_templates_9a1b.html" title="Wikipedia:No disclaimer templates">Wikipedia:No disclaimer templates</a>. I understand what you are trying to say here, but censoring for the sake of children is something that really rubs me the wrong way. What's flawed about your argument is that Bob Saget IS a very vulgar comedian. This isn't like we're pointing out something that's rare. Any child doing research on Bob Saget is very likely to come across his comedic material, quotes, or some other direct example of his comedy. An example of his use of vulgar words is actually appropriate on this article. It's a misconception that <i>Bob Saget</i> is a "wholesome topic", but he clearly is not. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 04:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>i never said bob sagat wasnt a vulgar person. nor was i trying to argue anything about who he is or isnt. maybe you are too engrossed in the topic to see that im not trying to hurt the article. i dont know. you dont seem to pay any attention to me saying that the quote doesnt add to the article nor would removing it (and placing it on Half Baked's page) reduce the quality of the article. and yes there are content disclaimers on/for wikipedia, ive seen them myself. " Some words or phrases on this page may be found to be offensive by some readers." was one and there were warning tags somewhere on wikipedia to use. the restoring of his early life paragraphs seems to have moved the quote down the page, making the words "suck dick for coke" less of a focus. <a href="../../../m/8/g/User%7EM8gen_a7cd.html" title="User:M8gen">M8gen</a> 07:02, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Such warning tags are deleted when found, but I do not doubt we haven't found them all. The only warning tags that are viewed as acceptable (and even that is sometimes disputed) are <a href="../../../s/p/o/WP%7ESPOILER_5d48.html" title="WP:SPOILER">spoiler tags</a>. I understand you think that removing the quote doesn't hurt the article. I'm saying that I feel the quote is appropriate for the article, and that the removal is needless and simply for the sake of censorship for children. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 07:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The quote in question doesn't seem especially gratuitous or inappropriate, in my opinion. However, I don't think there is a reason we need to link "suck dick".

<dd>Known by whom? When I googled that phrase I did see some entries that said "video" is the king, but they didn't mention Saget. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 01:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like this has been re-added with a podcast as a source. Some random comment by a non-notable podcaster hardly seems worth including. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 21:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "non-notable podcaster" seems to be notable enough to have its page at <a href="../../../b/u/z/Buzz_Out_Loud_6ea3.html" title="Buzz Out Loud">Buzz Out Loud</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomo_Hemo_cae0.html" title="User:Momo Hemo">Momo Hemo</a> 11:35, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So it does, my mistake. Nonetheless, a single reference in a podcast does not mean that Saget is "known" as the "king of user generated content", only that he's been called that. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 20:40, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Will is correct. And plus, that comment on Buzz Out Loud was a joke to see if anyone would fall for the trick of adding it to the article (ala Stephen Colbert). Don't fall for it.
