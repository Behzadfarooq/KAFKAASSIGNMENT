<dd>"I said John Kerry's a hero. But what I will always quarrel about are the Purple Hearts. I mean, the first one, whether he ought to have a Purple Heart — he got two in one day, I think. And he was out of there in less than four months, because three Purple Hearts and you're out," Mr. Dole told CNN's <i>Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.</i> "But three Purple Hearts and never bled, that I know of? I mean, they're all superficial wounds," said Mr. Dole of the military decoration for troops wounded in battle. "And as far as I know, he's never spent one day in the hospital. I don't think he draws any disability pay. He doesn't have any disability — and boasting about three Purple Hearts, when you think of some of the people who really got shot up in Vietnam," Mr. Dole said. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040823-124014-1219r.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040823-124014-1219r.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p><i>In the 1996 Presidential Election, Dole received the Republican nomination easily</i></p>
<p>Are you <i>kidding</i> me? In the months leading up to the primary, Dole may have held his own against Taylors and the Lugars of the campaign, but "Lamar!" was a serious challenge. Buchanan stole Gramm's show in Louisiana, and then won New Hampshire, splitting it with Dole and Alexander. Buchanan not only never endorsed him but held a rally at the start of the convention. Not to mention Forbes was winning primaries as late as Delaware. The length of the primary race was one reason why the campaign was strapped for cash and unable to match Clinton's ad spending in the late spring and summer. I am going to rewrite this whole section. - <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoster_075d.html" title="User:Choster">choster</a> 21:27, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's pretty inaccurate. The other candidates did not contest Louisiana because it was prior to Louisiana. Dole swept most primaries easily. He entered as the favorite and lived up to it throughout the primaries.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.16.185.42 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.16.185.42.html" title="User talk:68.16.185.42">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.16.185.42_fcaa.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.16.185.42">contribs</a>) 16:26, 26 August 2006.</small></p>

<p>Could someone explain why Dole is often parodied as referring to himself in the third person? As far as I know, this only stemmed from a campaign speech in which he said, "You're going to see a new Bob Dole out there." But back in the '90s (and even more recently) he was mocked endlessly on Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons and whatnot for this, as though he begins every sentence with "Bob Dole thinks" or "Bob Dole says". --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 15:02, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is just speculation, but perhaps it was difficult to characterize Dole, as he's not the most charismatic character. Maybe the 3rd person thing was intended to 1. make sure the viewer knew it was him, and 2. be funny, as it's always funny when people repeatedly refer to themselves in the 3rd person.

<p>Quotes "When these political action committees give money, they expect something in return other than good government." -- Bob Dole, 1983 (before he got lots of PAC money)</p>
<p>"What is amazing is how young he looks for how old he is." -- Dole's first wife Phyllis Macey (who, at 71, is a year younger than Bob.)</p>
<p>"The Internet is a good tool to use to get on the Net." - Bob Dole, 1996</p>
<p>"I know there are California oranges and Florida oranges. When I'm in Florida, I like Florida oranges. Today, I think California oranges are the best, of course." -- Bob Dole, in California, 3/25/96</p>
<p>"The only place you see a free market is in the speeches of politicians. People who are not in the Midwest do not understand that this is a socialist country." -- Dwayne Andreas of Archer Daniels Midland, one of Dole's biggest contributors</p>
<p>"Bob Dole is the tax collector for the welfare state." -- Newt Gingrich, 1983.</p>
<p>“Bob waits to see which way the wind is blowing. … There’s always a question: Does he have a vision? You won’t see him creating an agenda.” – Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kansas (Doles 1980 campaign co-chairman)</p>

<p>Suprisingly, the article mentions that "While in the Senate he also served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1971 until 1973," but stops short of mentioning Dole's involvement in Watergate. While the more careful reader will notice that this was during the height of the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a> scandal, there should be explicit mention of this fact.</p>
<p>In fact, Dole was a key player in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a>, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/Bob.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/Bob.html" rel="nofollow">a Washington Post writeup</a>. Although found to have done nothing illegal, he was a very vocal supporter of Nixon (at first) and critic of The Post. The Post writeup also claims that the stigma of Watergate made Dole's senate re-election campaign in 1974 difficult. The Watergate Scandal had enough of an impact on Dole's life to merit at least a one or two sentence insert.</p>
<p>This article is very "top heavy." It gives much more weight to recent events and does not successfully balance in other major events in Dole's life.</p>

<p>And although several of you have deemed him "scary", etc I think he is the Presidential candidates I feel most good about voting for. I knew he would lose so there was no guilt about what he'd do as President, but also I've met him a few times, was at his Senate office once, and he'd helped out some of my relatives.

<p>I have objection, that link has nothing to do with the real Bob Dole. Also, someone added in the introduction that "Dole is often satirized in the media for his tendency to speak in the third person" while a few television shows (like Family Guy and SNL) have made jokes of this, it is untrue. Bob Dole did not have a tendency to speak in the third person in real life. User:Burroughsks88 01:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to say that the term "affiliation" answered your question, as the linked article questions the orthodoxy of his belief, not which church he chose to be affiliated with. However, adherents.com has two separate religions listed for him: Episcopalian <a href="http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_anglican.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_anglican.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and Presbyterian <a href="http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_pres.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_pres.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<p>JChap2007, calling a caricature mean-spirited is POV because it's not a fact, it's an interpretation. Leaving it out does no harm to the informational content of the article. It doesn't matter whether it's directed at Bob Dole himself or not, it's still an opinion. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupadawg_20b8.html" title="User:Supadawg">Supadawg</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupadawg_408a.html" title="User talk:Supadawg">Talk</a> 23:17, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In one of the sketches, the caricature is called "mean-spirited" by Dana Carvey's Geo. Bush character, so it doesn't seem like an intepretation to me. Just saying he refers to himself in the third person doesn't seem an adequate description. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 00:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe not, but it <i>seems</i> like an interpretation, especially to one who has not seen the skit. Saying it was "mean-spirited" didn't add anything to the description anyway. You could <i>attribute</i> it to the George Bush character. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupadawg_20b8.html" title="User:Supadawg">Supadawg</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupadawg_408a.html" title="User talk:Supadawg">Talk</a> 00:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article begins "Robert Joseph "Bob" Dole (born July 22, 1923) is best known as a former Republican United States Senate Majority Leader and Senator from Kansas from 1969-1996..." I'd contend he's best known as the Republican candidate in the '96 presidential election. Even if (and it's a big if) American readers know him better as the former senate leader and senator from Kansas, I'd be willing to bet that that's certainly not the case for international readers. Thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I think he's best known both in the US and abroad as a presidential candidate. By the way, you can sign your comments with four tildes (~~~~) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheshibboleth_b26a.html" title="User:Theshibboleth">Theshibboleth</a></dd>

<p>I see your reasoning, but I feel that a man with such a distinguished record of service shouldn't be immediately identified by his last defeat. I think majority leader should come first, then the defeat. You can still use the "best known as..." after identifying him as the SML. 165.201.5.7 20:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)Unregistered Steve</p>

<p>The bit where it discusses his medals is very poorly phrased: "Bob Dole was once decorated for heroic achievement, receiving two Purple Hearts for his injuries, and the Bronze Star Medal with combat "V" for valor for his attempt to assist a downed radio man that had died forty years later. His name was Rick Lemming.". He tried to help a man who died 40 years ago? The drowned man's name is "Lemming"? I believe they were trying to state that he was awarded the medal 40 years after he tried to save the man, but without basis to back that up, I'm unwilling to make an edit.

<p>I believe that more extensive information should be listed about Dole's military service. I recall from an interview that he ran in front of a german machine gun to rescue a radio operator. I cannot confirm this, but I think this kind of information should be added considering it is germane to his political career/credentials. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkBirdDuke_b901.html" title="User:MonkBirdDuke">MonkBirdDuke</a> 09:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The quote used to exemplify Dole's characteristic use of the third person is not an apt example. "You're going to see the real Bob Dole from now on."
