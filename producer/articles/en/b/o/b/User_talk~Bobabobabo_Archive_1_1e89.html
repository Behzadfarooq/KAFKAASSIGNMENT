<p>Hi. Just dropped by to tell you that I'm removing the images of Saiou's cards from the "Representations" section of the article. Since almost every card Saiou plays has some symbolic meaning, I think it would be better if we just kept the images in the "Tarot readings" section, instead of both, as none of the other GX characters have <i>every</i> last card of theirs in pic form on their pages, and the normal tarot cards are unique to Saiou as a character. If you disagree, then just go ahead and revert the page back to how it was before. I just feel that it's starting to get a bit clogged up. - <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a></p>

<li>Hey, just adding this here in case you don't spot in the history of Saiou's pg. Monster Reincarnation (not Monster Reborn) is on the bottom of Saiou's deck in the Japanese version of ep. 61 while Majoume is shuffling his deck.</li>

<li>Well, don't revert vandalism, then put the right page back.

<li>To answer your question, yes I do have an idea of the representations of the duel with Edo. I've added the "exception" within these episodes (which likely will continue in the duel with Judai), but will withold any other info until I have seen the rest of the season; I have a suspicion that the representations in these episodes do not follow the same trends as prior episodes, so I want to make sure before posting anything new. I will, however, post the representation point of The Devil, as it has special meaning to the episodes in question. -Benten</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've changed the image back to my original version because it better demonstrates his character. For a full explanation, visit the talk page. Hopefully, my reasoning will solve this problem once and for all, and you two will stop bickering over this. I specifically chose the image of Saiou in the infobox because I was sure that it presented him best, so I'd ask that in the future, you do not just upload new versions over my own uploads without first telling me. It would make it a lot easier for me to keep track of things. Thank you. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 05:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MIB made a point, and I think I have to agree with him on the matter. The image that was posted of Saiou freed from the Light of Ruin doesn't really do much for the article itself since its clogging up an already big image chunk of the page, and the relevance of Saiou's good-hearted side is better explored in Edo's story than in Judai's (with the image of Edo and Saiou fighting alongside Bloo-D, on Edo's page). Even though Saiou's good personality is important, I believe it would be better if we kept the sole picture of him in this state to Edo's page, and no more than that. This way, we can solve this problem once and for all. I don't mean to be insulting towards you (I'm glad you took the initiative to post the pic of Saiou's good side), merely that this would resolve the issue. I hope you understand.

<p>I am sorry for the editing with Saiou. It is just that I can't stand 4Kids entertainment and I finally saw that Saiou's age had been placed properly to an approximate. The age of a character should not be posted unless it is denfinite or close.</p>

<li>I'm thinking we should keep the semesters divided. The Society of Light arc clearly ends at 104, and the new characters start coming in. The only reason we didn't split up year one was because the plot never brought up the shift in semesters; Daitokuji was the only one to mention that an entire year had passed. This way, I think it'll be more organized and less confusing. -Benten</li>

<li>I've reverted to the previous version; I thought there was an agreement a while back among most of us that we would keep summaries off the page, and leave any info like that to the seperate episode pgs. Thus, it should not be changed back; the summaries just prove to be problematic for the article's size (which may eventually exceed the "preferable limit" of around 50k I believe it was), and the color change isn't doing anything at all (not in the aesthetic sense; it's actually not changing any colors or whatnot on the page itself). --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 01:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. I would be glad to help you but I actually haven't watched the whole series.

<p>Hi. I recently revamped the entire <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_InuYasha_episodes_92e1.html" title="List of InuYasha episodes">List of InuYasha episodes</a> article and replaced the images with the DVD cover images. I did that because the individual screenshots made the page look cluttered. I assume it was you who reverted my edits, if not, please ignore this. If it was you however, I am sorry that I had to replace your screenshots. I thought that we could instead use those screenshots in the individual articles. Please reply if you wish to revert the page again because that means I have to delete the 48 images I uploaded, which I do not wish to do. It's just that it improves the look of the article e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fullmetal_Alchemist_episodes_00b0.html" title="List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes">List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes</a>.

<dd>Bobabobabo, I added the questions to your RFA. For some reason they weren't included in the initial draft. I'd suggest answering them to give the RFA participants some guidance before they opine/!vote. It's also been delisted by a 'crat. Just relist once you've answered the q's.

<dd><i>(edit conflict)</i> Hi. As you probably have noticed, I've delisted your RfA for the time being. That does not mean that it's been closed or rejected, it's just a measure to make sure you have a fair go at this. The RfA is not conforming to the standard format, which will lead most users to either abstain or oppose. I urge you to take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">this page</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_requests_for_adminship_d0e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship">Guide to RfAs</a>, so that you can adjust your RfA (answer the questions and so on). Once you have done that, you can relist your RfA again — remember to reset the time in the header: 7 days from the time you relist your RfA, not sooner.

<p>Though I'm flattered by your nomination, at the present time, I do not feel that I can put in the amount of devotion needed to be an admin. I will continue to work towards improving pages as I have always done, but the responsibility just seems a bit too great (at least for now). Perhaps I will consider it in the future. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 19:44, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest you withdrawl your nomination for Rfa. Get an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_a3a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review">Wikipedia:Editor Review</a> work on the things you need to and then come back later. <a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJcam_7f9c.html" title="User:Jcam">Jcam</a> 00:39, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Evidently you're RfA turned into quite a mauling. Sorry about that. I should have realized the "I guess I accept" was an indication that you didn't know what you were getting into. In any case, despite all the negative comments, I wouldn't look on this as an evaluation of your value as an <i>editor</i>, as adminship is a different animal. I encourage you to continue contributing to various Pokemon articles and keep being a wikipedian. Watch those fair use images and be careful, of edit warring, of course, and you should be fine. I hope you'll stick around. Let me know if you have questions, concerns, or whatever.
