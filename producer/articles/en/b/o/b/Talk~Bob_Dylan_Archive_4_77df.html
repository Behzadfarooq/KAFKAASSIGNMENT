<h2><span class="mw-headline">œuvre?</span></h2>
<p>I just want to say that the new opening paragraph is substantially worse than it was before. It assumes that one has a familiarity with all the other musicians mentioned, including someone as widely unknown as Stephen Foster. People may debate about the influence of one musician as opposed to another, but there is no way one could argue that Bob Dylan is not vastly more famous than all the other musicians mentioned. Therefore, the opening paragraph should not start off by comparing Dylan to them. Why mention other musicians at all?</p>
<p>Regarding the beginning paragraph where it says "his enduring contributions to the American œuvre are comparable to"... what does œuvre mean? I couldn't find the exact word on google and I didn't bother looking further because, in my opinion, an obscure word like this should not be used in the introductory paragraph of an English-language article. So unless someone offers a suitable alternative soon, I will re-word that sentence. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpookfish_b8ce.html" title="User:Spookfish">Spookfish</a> 04:26, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you are looking for a site with a lower reading level than the 8th-9th grade of Wikipedia proper, you might take a look at the Simple English Wikipedia: <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>. Oh, also Google shows approximately 37,000,000 hits on "oeuvre" (most just articles on whatever topic that use the word).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Still, all of those definitions say that "oeuvre" refers to the body of work of a single artist, not of an entire country. So that sentence doesn't really make sense. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 05:56, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First of all, the word I referred to (spelled with the œ character) is not even the English version, and yet this is the English-version article for Bob Dylan. This is why I couldn't easily find an English definition. Secondly, of the first 5 pages (50+ sites) returned by Google for "oeuvre", only 2 seem to come from English sites. Bottom line, this a relatively obscure word in the common English lexicon and my original comment genuinely reflected that. Since the definition is appropriate though, I decided to leave it in but in its English version. Also, because it's reasonable to assume the average English-speaking viewer will not know its definition, I've linked the word to wiktionary. The irony about all this is that Bob Dylan's music was about giving the average man a voice, a voice he could relate to, and yet here you are being a snob about vocabulary. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpookfish_b8ce.html" title="User:Spookfish">Spookfish</a> 06:41, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just out of curiousity, I searched, and found that the word "oeuvre" is used in 490 articles on the English Wikipedia. Limiting the Google search to only English language pages <i>does</i> admittedly limit the hits to just 3,240,000. As to whether WP should use the dipthong in its orthography... I dunno, there might be style guide about it, but either way seems fine. I don't usually bother with characters that are hard to enter on my keyboard, but some users enter more diacritics than me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 07:42, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Main Portrait</span></h2>
<p>May I suggest that, considering Bob Dylan is still alive, we place an up to date photo of him as the main portrait. It seems silly not to have the picture as what he looks like now. Opinions? <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_allemany_a461.html" title="User:Levi allemany">Levi_allemany</a> 08:41 GMT 23 September 2005</p>
<p>I would say there is a lack of photos in general in this article. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 14:07, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the problem is that what most of us have in mind of the Dylan songs is connected to his earliest years. So when we think of Dylan, we mostly remember him looking like he does on the main page and sounding like the songs he published in the sixties. But this is not, of course, an argument against putting an up-to-date picture of him onto the main page. Hans Rosenthal (ROHA) (hans.rosenthal AT t-online.de -- replace AT by @ )</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I'd want at least two photos of Dylan near the top. One when he was still in his 20s (like we have), and one when he was over 50. I don't think every change of clothing and hairstyle is necessary, even decade by decade, but "bookends" of his adult life (so far) would be useful. There <i>is</i> the 1997 concert photo a ways down, but if something that was more of a portrait, from the last decade, could be found it would be good. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 01:43, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with both ROHA and lulu. The current image should stay where it is, but another, more portrait-like photograph from more recent times (late 90's to current) should definately be included. I'm picture the love&amp;theft cover in my mind, but it's probably got copyright issues. -<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 02:07, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You all agree and yet nobody's doing anything about the pictures.... I for one would be honored to add an up-to-date picture of Bob Dylan but I really, really can't find one&#160;:( --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManwe_3608.html" title="User:Manwe">Manwe</a> 10:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems in mass change</span></h2>
<p>An anonymous editor, User:69.174.186.78 made a very large number of changes to the article at once. I think (but I'm not sure), this was an exact restoration of some pre-Monicasdude version. The anon's edit history is wholly on the Dylan article, and indicates unhappiness with Monicasdude.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the RfC process, the rollback misses many worthwhile additions that are more recent. Please make changes paragraph (or at most section) at a time, and note the general reasons for each change so editors can evaluate them.</p>
<p>Some problems in the mass change that are better in the current version (to my mind, and not necessarily complete):</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of perfectly good image caption change</li>
<li>Too much rambling material in the lead</li>
<li>Minor Weatherman reference restored to lead rather than better, less prominent context</li>
<li>Loss of improved section titles</li>
<li>Throughout, much too much "purple prose" and subjective tone</li>
<li>Introduction of previously corrected spelling fixes</li>
<li>Restoration of unneeded Seeger apocryphon</li>
<li>Reintroduction of wholly fictional "Friendship Years" stuff</li>
<li>Loss of painfully ironed-out xtian-period language</li>
<li>Subjective "doldrums" phrase</li>
<li>Loss of recent note on Scorcese film</li>
<li>Subjective "most famous songs" reintroduced</li>
<li>Destruction of wikification of links</li>
<li>False categories</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some wordings that are better in the mass change... but let's find them individually, and insert them thoughtfully, and where relevant. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:44, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't the introduction to the article mention the instruments Dylan plays? A Dylan newbie would have to read through his bio sections before learning what instruments he plays.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The anti-lead again</span></h2>
<p>This article attracts some weird editors. "He who says ROHA" is back again, and trying to kill the lead. It's just plain weird. S/he seems only to edit this page, and only for purposes of preventing more than one sentence summary from occuring before the TOC. I don't want to 3RR, can some other editors keep a watch on this as well. Thanks.</p>
<p>Btw.

What <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> has in mind is something like this: I loved Bob Dylan from the beginning. I still love his music. Dylan is a very important musician and poet, I don't know why, but somehow he seems to be. Some call him a "whatever", and the others call him a "never-ever", so is he not by the terms of being a "whatever" and "never-ever" at the _same_ time a "whichywhachy-ever-ever" at the same time&#160;? -- Yup, sit down and listen to an old Dylan song: (-- Did you expect me to chose one for your convinience&#160;? -- Now, you and everybody has his and her own songs.) I can not be of any more help. (But not to forget: The "== The anti-lead again ==" simply means that not a single man can take over control of a Wikipedia-Article according to his own rules.)

<dd>Widely regarded by whom? By tens of millions of Americans alive at the time, including an obvious and easily documented majority of music critics... <b>""one of" should be avoided in any NPoV article because they are weaselly kinds of words."</b> Huh? If "one of" and similar phrases were to be banned from "NPOV articles" there would be no way to indicate a condition between "all" and "none". Sorry, that's absurd. Are you denying there have been other great American songwriters? If you're not denying that, then Dylan must be <b>one of</b> them, no? Let's not get carried away with the anti-weasel sentiment. It's a good sentiment but, like most sentiments, becomes unworkable if applied absolutely... <b>""Dylan is credited with expanding the vocabulary of popular music" - again, by whom?"</b>-- Again, by tens of millions of music fans and a steep majority of critics (SEC, in characterizing a majority public POV a Wikipedia editor is *not* giving his own POV-- this essential distinction needs to be learned by scores of editors around here, and not a few Admins). Do you really need documentation of this crediting?

<p>Sometimes you will not find the name "Bob Dylan" among the hits when searching for the term "singer-songwriter".

<dd>I try not to touch the JDG/monicasdude dispute with a 10 foot pole.. but in this instance, the use of lyrics is unquestionably fair use. It is clearly OK to quote six lines of a historically significant Dylan song in an article about Dylan. The quote is a small portion of one song's lyrics. It's done for educational purposes and it does not threaten Dylan's album sales. Publishing a 30-60 second clip of a song in a larger work is generally accepted to fall within fair use. So quoting the lyrics from that clip counts as fair use too, doesn't it? There might be an editorial reason to keep the lyrics out of the article, but there isn't a copyright problem here. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 02:51, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Trying to assume good faith. JDG, where did you get that sentence? Maybe you weren't suggesting we actually add it to the article, since you knew it was an exact copy from EB? If you look at the Britannica article <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031669?query=bob%20dylan&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031669?query=bob%20dylan&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it is pretty much an exact copy.
<ul>
<li>Us: "Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan has sold more than 58 million albums, written more than 500 songs recorded by more than 2,000 artists, performed all over the world, and has raised the standard for lyric writing over a nearly 45-year career."</li>
<li>EB: "Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan sold more than 58 million albums, wrote more than 500 songs recorded by more than..." - cut off by the 75 word limit.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The paraphrased version "Dylan has been called the Shakespeare of his generation, and has sold more than 58 million albums so far in his career" is still plagiarism. Plagiarizing EB is bad news. I vote for not making the Shakespeare mention at all in the lead section. We should instead cite a specific writer who has made the comparison in the body. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:26, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Times' own online search facility (as available to subscribers) indicates that it has never called Dylan (or anyone else) the "Shakespeare of his generation"; in fact, it doesn't ever seem to have used that phrase (at least since 1850). "Shakespeare of his times" doesn't show up, either; and the only hit on both Bob Dylan and Shakespeare that looks even remotely (very remotely) like a source is a letter to the editor. interferenza.com is a usually reliable Dylan fansite, but the phrase there is from an unsourced English translation of a German-language article/interview. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:43, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I was laying a trap. I was expecting a lot of people to raise shouts of "pathetically POV" and "nauseating purple prose", at which point I would grin and say "It's the first line in Encyclopedia Britannica's Dylan article". I'm very surprised at the mostly positive reactions here. I've had statements in this article and proposed statements here in Talk shot down dead that were far less assertive and "purple". Really makes you think about what's "appropriate for an encyclopedia". It's a reminder of how far off so many people commenting here have been, the ones who want to portray D. basically as just another singer-songwriter with a Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 06:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

There are people out there who don't care for <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> and <i>Blonde and Blonde</i>, but this is not mentioned in the article.

<dl>
<dd>The Blues Harp is a specific model of harmonica, also made by Hohner, not to be confused with "blues harp" in general, which is a style of harmonica playing, i.e. playing in second position. The Hohner Blues Harp is made to facilitate "bending" notes, which is necessary to play in second position, but you can bend on any diatonic harp. Dylan often plays harp in second position -- i.e., "blues harp" -- but he plays Marine Bands. --Ajsomerset 19:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I think the quote is a nice addition to the article. I feel the best editors concern themselves not only with things like factuality, strong sourcing, thoroughness, but also with the tone and timbre, even the atmospherics, of an article-- particularly in non-sci/tech articles where the human factor is central. This is an article on a major American arts/culture figure and it invites some color, just as the arts themselves are colorful and even often frivolous. To capture this, we need to be willing to sometimes step out of our strictly "encyclopedic" voice (as, for instance, the Enc. Brit. very often does on topics like these), and this amusing snippet from Bob's stage pronunciamentos, to me, is perfect. Of course, in going for some color and atmospherics, editors will whiff big time once in a while. If many feel the "sermonette" is actually a faulty try for color, I certainly wouldn't put up a struggle. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 23:39, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Lion King: No, I’m not deaf but you appear to be very stupid. No, seriously, you are obviously a very talented and committed Wikipedia contributor. We Wikipedia contributors should be able to resolve our disagreement through reasoned discussion, not through abuse when someone disagrees with us. The way I hear the Manchester concert is that a male voice shouts “xxxx you” (I actually think he shouts “Fuck you” but the first word is not clear.) Then immediately afterwards another man (Keith Butler? Jon Cordwell? Who knows?) shouts “Judas!” I’ve listened to it dozens of times and I strongly believe the two voices are different. I don’t believe anyone shouts “Hey you, Judas!” You look at any biography of Dylan. The reason this concert has become a key moment in Dylan’s history is that someone shouted “Judas!” They accused him of betraying folk music. (There is even a Dylan fanzine to which I contribute named “Judas!”. It is not named “Hey you Judas!”) To change the words to “Hey you, Judas!” is in my view inaccurate, and seriously dilutes the most famous heckle in the history of rock music.

So this is a task for you Dylan specialists: Please remove nonsense from the "Categories" at the bottom of this Wiki entry. Thank you.

<dd>While I tend to think most of these compound ethnic categories are rather inane and pointless, that's a general quarrel with the categories. Given that they <i>do</i> exist, their criteria is... well, too fuzzy... but roughly people who have at least 1/4 of their ancestry from a given place, prior to American immigration. That seems to be satisfied for Dylan. Likewise for the Jewish one, which sort overlaps with those others as a pseudo-ethnic/national category. But if <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianne_Feinstein_39e6.html" title="Dianne Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Dee_28e1.html" title="Sandra Dee">Sandra Dee</a> are Russian-American, Dylan might as well be too (actually, Dee is basically entirely wrong, being <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusyns.html" title="Rusyns">Rusyns</a> not <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">Russian</a> ancestry... but like I say, the ethnic categories are sort of garbabe). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 06:17, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Answer to User <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a>: I think that you have a rather clear idea why I use to remove the introductory propaganda picture of Adolf Hitler from the English Wikipedia article. The reason why you do not mention my arguments within this context is obvious to me, but not to most of the other readers of the article about Bob Dylan. So I will explain my reasons here: Whenever I remove the propaganda photograph from the "Adolf Hitler" article, I do it since propaganda should not be spread all over the Internet world by the Wikipedia. While when I make a change on the "Bob Dylan" article, I do it because I think that the readers should be informed about Bob Dylan in a neutral way. Dylan is a singer, a songwriter, a musician, a poet, and a composer. He is also a player of the guitar, piano, and the harmonica. He is certainly one of the most important artists of the twentieth century. And exactly for that reason, his name must not be misused for personal purposes. At least not within the Wikipedia. To mention the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weatherman_%28organization%29.html" title="Weatherman (organization)">Weatherman (organization)</a> within this article does neither have to do with Dylan's life, nor with his music, nor with his poetry. I am sure that if you could ask Dylan about something like the "Weatherman", he would ask you: What is this&#160;? I know that it is tempting to add lines of pure personal interest to a Wikipedia article, but if this would be raised to a rule, then the Wiki would very soon consist of personal interests, and soon lose its objectivity. To cut it short: The Wikipedia is not a good place for personal interests, neither for propaganda (as in the case of Hitler), nor for personal and unjustified preferences (as in the case of Dylan).

<dd>You are completely right. Bob Dylan's work had an impact on about two million people. Among them may be 20 thousand musicians. Among these may there be twenty artists who have the status as a musical superstar. But, as long as you are inable to count all the twenty superstars by their name, you should not introduce into this Wikipedia article names like the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weatherman_%28organization%29.html" title="Weatherman (organization)">Weatherman (organization)</a>. If you can mention only one single incident when Dylan referred to them, let me hear about this. I must be more precise: When he ever had a far-off smell of something like the members of the Weatherman (organization), then, please, let him know. As long as some of you only claim that Dylan had an impact on some organization which he himself does not have the slightest idea of, as long as that you should not mention or claim that Dylan had an "influence" on them.

<dd>Okay, lets simplify my argumentation. Lets concentrate on the "Weatherman (organization)". Can you please give distinct references from the literature or from the Internet, as to in what way Bob Dylan's work influenced the "Weatherman (organization)" except that it _is said_ to have chosen its name from a Dylan song&#160;? What in particular was the influence that Dylan is said to have had on this organization&#160;? As long as you cannot give substantial references, there is no reason to mention this organization within this article. Bob Dylan had an influence on Joan Baez (and vice versa), on the civil rights movements (which the "Weatherman (organization)" was not part of), on literature and music. For this, we have more than enough references. But can you give good references for his impact on the "Weatherman (organization)"&#160;? I remind you of the fact that in the current version of this article it simply says: "As a sign of the political influence of Dylan's lyrics, in 1969 the militant Weatherman radical group took their name from a line in "Subterranean Homesick Blues" ("You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows")." -- Now, it claims that there was "political influence", since a "radical group" picked up its NAME from a Dylan song. But where is the reference for Dylan's "political influence" on this group&#160;? Everyone and every organization can pick up a line or a word from a Dylan song as a NAME (as long as they are not copyrighted), but that does not say Dylan's work had any "political influence" on them. If you disagree, then please let me and the other readers know.

<dd>"What is the difference between a reference and a citation to you?" -- Here is a simple example that hopefully clarifies the difference: "Euclid proved the infinitude of prime numbers." -- This I call a citation. "Here is Euclid's proof: [Insert here Euclid's mathematical-logical proof of the statement]". -- This I call a reference. The difference between the two should be obvious. To cut this example down to the current context of the Dylan-influenced-the-"Weatherman" discussion is this: "Dylan influenced the "Weatherman"". -- This I call a citation. "Here is Dylan's influence on the "Weatherman" [Insert here sources of that statement]". -- This I call a reference. I hope that this example makes clear that there is a fundamental difference between a citation and a reference: A citation may consist of everything that you want, a reference is the essence (the pointer to the root, the origin) of a statement or claim. For this reason, the quotation from the NYT is a citation, but not a reference. You also asked: "but if they took their name from him, why not say it?" -- This is a valid argument. I answer: You are right, they took their name from a Dylan song, but so what? Would this allow us to mention all the people or organizations that ever picked up a word from a Dylan song to mention them in this article? I think no.

<dd>No, I think Dylan's intensely evangelical period can't be denied, and I pretty much go along with the argument put forth by Dylan biographers like Clinton Heylin and Howard Sounes, poet Christopher Ricks, and critic Paul (Crawdaddy) Williams that much of Dylan's songwriting since that period ended incorporates less conventional expression of religious themes. I originally wrote (and user:Lulu agreed with) "When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980, Dylan refused to play secular music," which is undisputed anywhere but here. But factual accuracy doesn't seem to be much of a concern in this argument anymore, note that user:Lulu reinstated the (utterly ridiculous, completely unsourced) paragraph I deleted regarding Lowell George. Since that poor guy died in June 1979, it's hard to imagine he wrote a song about what Dylan did in the fall of 1979. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 22:32, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I don't give any credence to your claims here about your motives. Do you have any reason to to dispute that Lowell George died in June 1979, months before the events he supposedly wrote about in the song mentioned? This isn't exactly an obscure point; all you had to do to check was click the wikilink in the article. You reverted edits, out of malice demonstrated by your personal attacks, simply because I made them, even though the factual assertions are unchallenged outside of this talk page. Claiming that Lowell George, or anyone else, wrote about events occurring after his death so plainly fails the verifiability standard as to require no debate about removal. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 23:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the Lowell George song: Monicasdude has long stated that Dylan became Christian (or at least Christian-influenced) significantly before his <i>Saved</i> tour. So George may have known this before the Fall 1979 tour, and before George's death (even, e.g. earlier in 1979). But I don't know the date on the George song, which would obviously be germane (and is not in his article). But even if not George's song, the Lennon song seems relevant, and the general comment of the paragraph. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 01:35, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Saved</i> tour was in 1980, not 1979; that album wasn't recorded until February 1980 and released in June 1980. Lowell George died in June 1979; the album including the song in question was released before his death, and various online sources put its recording date in late 1978. By all reliable accounts, Dylan's "born-again" experience was in early 1979, and he didn't record his first album of evangelical songs, Gotta Serve Somebody, until May 1979. There's no credible timeline that fits with that wholly unsourced Lowell George story, no citation of any evidence that the song was meant to refer to Dylan, just a snatch of lyrics apparently referring to a pious hypocrite -- hardly an unusual figure in a pop song. User:Lulu should apply the same standards for sourcing to comments he agrees with as for those he disagrees with; and it's not up to other editors to disprove unsourced, plainly implausible statements. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess it had to happen. Anyway, I made the one word improvement of removing the spurious word "violent" from the description of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weatherman_%28organization%29.html" title="Weatherman (organization)">Weatherman (organization)</a>. I don't think it's untrue as a description, it just has no connection to the Dylan article (there <i>is</i> some POV issue there, since they only bombed property, never people, and opinions differ on whether that constitutes "violence"). We don't need to try to push readers to think the "right" thing about any given thing we mention with irrelevant adjectives. What's notable in this article is that they're named after a Dylan lyric, not anything else about the organization (well, "radical" probably gives minimal descriptive context). Likewise, we don't string a bunch of adjectives in front of Duluth when we mention it, not even true ones. Readers are welcome to read about the town on their own.</p>
<p>Obviously, one word is, well, one word. But Monicasdude's old pattern of rolling back changes by other editors is the annoying same-old same-old that we needed to RfC before. Anyway, please keep a watch on this change for me... I can't fix it again without 3RR. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 15:28, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">User:Lulu personalizes another editing dispute</span></h3>
<p>There is no dispute that the Weather Underground was a violent organization. Every editor who has worked on this paragraph, until User:Lulu's edit today, has included a characterization of the group. The existing text, which simply and accurately described the groups as "violent" without characterizing their motives, represented a working compromise that was acceptable to all involved until today. User: Lulu's personalization of the dispute is inappropriate and constitutes yet another display of personal spite on his part, which he regularly displays against editors, here and elsewhere, who do not treat his opinions with the respect he believes they deserve. I have no doubt that the edit warring and inappropriate personalization of disputes that user:Lulu promotes and provokes will continue here, but there remains no justification for removing accurate references from this article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:42, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

ROHA stated earlier that: "To mention the Weatherman (organization) within this article does neither have to do with Dylan's life, nor with his music, nor with his poetry."

<p>Unfortunately, the issue that promoted Monicasdude's RfC, months of discussion over compromise language, repeated page protection, and all the rest, has returned again. Monicasdude is again taking out any reference to Dylan's early-1980s return to recording secular material, after the brief late-1970s/earyl-1980s period of recording Christian songs.

<dd>You might consider sticking to facts and avoiding personal attacks, although those haven't been your habits here. Anybody who reads the article can see that I didn't take out "any reference" to Dylan's post-1980 recording of secular material. What is at the center of the dispute is your insistence that the article reflect your personal opinion that Dylan's songwriting has been almost entirely secular for the last 20 years, even though you have never cited critical sources reflecting that opinion, and have repeatedly deleted from the article quotations from and references to prominent writers about Dylan who disagree with that opinion (justifying the deletions as "original research," which is nonsense in terms of Wikipedia policies. Even Empire Burlesque, the album described as "consistently secular" in the paragraph you reinstated, was described by Allen Ginsberg as marked by "judgmental Jehovaic theism."</dd>
<dd>If you stopped personalizing editing disputes and started complying with NPOV, NOR, and verifiability, this dispute would be over. Instead, you repeatedly promote the insertion of obvious nonsense into the article -- like your insistence a few weeks back that the article should include an unsourced claim that Lowell George wrote a song about events taking place after his death -- simply because it gives you an excuse to tee off on me. This argument is just another example; you avoid the point that the text you reinserted is undeniably factually inaccurate, in favor of describing me as "maniacal." That's not good behavior, that's not complying with Wikipedia policies, that's not good faith editing. It's impossible to see as anything other than spite and malice, after months and months of this vendetta. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:26, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Never mind all that though; I don't think this paragraph is necessary to the article nor very helpful. It is already mentioned in the previous paragraph that he returned to writing and performing "secular" songs. <a href="../../../t/i/x/User%7ETixity_9e17.html" title="User:Tixity">Tix</a> 23:21, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The use of the word "secular" to describe any of Dylan's songs is inaccurate. Dylan's lyrics can always be interpreted from a religious perspective. The "Christian Trilogy" (<i>Slow Train Coming</i>, <i>Saved</i>, &amp; <i>Shot Of Love</i>) contain lyrics that are more overtly Christian, evangelistic, and apocalyptic--as is some of the cover art, for that matter. The lyrics before &amp; after those three are much less overtly Christian, &amp;c., and more open to interpretations from other perspectives--Jewish, Zen, the blues, deconstructionist, Freudian, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Let's remove the word "secular" from the article &amp; say more explicitly &amp; w/ more evidence from the lyrics themselves what we are hearing. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 03:27, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
It is rubbish to say that Dylan has become 'secular' since the 1980's. Infidels is perhaps just as religious as the three evangelical albums. Virtually every line of Jokerman is a Biblical quotation,look at 'Henry, John. "Links of Jokerman and Scripture." 5 September 1999 &lt;<a href="http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~wparr/henryjokerman.html" class="external free" title="http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~wparr/henryjokerman.html" rel="nofollow">http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~wparr/henryjokerman.html</a>&gt;.' Empire Burlesque is religious too, 'Something's Burning Baby' is underpinned by the line from 1 Peter 4.18 'where charity covers a multitude of sins' as well as the reference to matthew 4.4 and Luke 4.4 in 'you can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied' as well as to the tomb of Jesus in the next line 'you can't role away the stone if your hands are tied.' In Michael J. Gimour 'Tangled Up in the Bible: Bob Dylan &amp; Scripture (continuum, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8264-1602-0</a>) he lists in a table every quotation from scripture in the Dylan corpus. It takes over 30 pages. Every album, before and after the so-called evangelical period contains numerous biblical references and allusions. I think then, what we should say is that Dylan became more cryptic in the 1980's and that while religion was still a strong influence upon his work he choose to express it differently, he moved away from the overt religious message of slow train, shot of love and saved and moved toward an under-current of religious imagery and language that perpetuated all of his songs. that this was misunderstood as a return to being secular is a crime, firstly because it certainly wasn't (those that believe it to be so probably do so because they are not familiar enough with the bible to notice the allusions or their significance) and secondly because it wasn't a return to anything because Dylan has always expressed a great deal of religion within his songs. (such as All along the Watchtower or With God on our Side.) look at Christopher Ricks, Visions of Sin, or at Pickering, Stephen. Bob Dylan Approximately: A Portrait of the Jewish Poet in Search of God (A Midrash). New York: David McKay Company, 1975.</p>

<li>I agree with your basic point, but the question is, how to word it? "Cryptic" isn't right. There is a strong difference between the three gospel albums and the other stuff, although there is a lot of religious imagery throughout his career ("Gospel Plow" is on his first album), and frequent religious references in interview. But there is a strong difference between evangelicalism/fundamentalism, and a more general sort of spirituality. <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 13:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with you. 'Cryptic' is weak. I think perhaps it could be said that whereas in the 3 evangelical albums the religious meaning was clearly explicit the religious language in the later albums became more implicit. It was certainly there, but it required interpretation and a closer reading to find it. As such it was initally missed by the music press who were eager for a return to form from Dylan (a return that they believed had to be associated with a move away from his Christianity.) I think it is possible, for example, to read Jokerman without a religious meaning, whereas this is not true of the songs from the evangelical albums. For a chiefly secular music press that the religious content was not so explicit was appealing. They could say that Dylan was cleverly working a subtle religion into his songs (which is exactly what he was doing) rather than thinking he was some sort of evangelical fundamentalist preeching to his fans (which is exactly what he had been doing!) --PurpleGecko00 13:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think these stats are necessary for the page. They are interesting, and should be linked to, but they only clutter up the main Bob Dylan page. Either make a page dealing with Dylan's live performances over the years, or only give an external link to the page you got these stats from. What do other people think? <a href="../../../t/i/x/User%7ETixity_9e17.html" title="User:Tixity">Tix</a> 02:09, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you that the lists of statistics should be removed from the article; aside from the clutter, they're fundamentally inaccurate, because the database they come from is seriously incomplete. As with many popular bands/artists, much of Dylan's performing career is well-documented, but the early years (roughly the first 20% of his career) are reported rather poorly. For 1961, as an example, the database shows only 39 appearances (although Dylan, by all accounts, performed many more dates than that), and includes songlists for only a half dozen of the 39 listed appearances. I don't believe -- I don't think anybody believes -- that Dylan played "Blowin' In The Wind" less than a dozen times in the 1960s; presenting statistics based on data so incomplete is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 04:19, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pseudonyms</span></h2>
<p>Bob Landy is listed as a pen-name of Dylan, but Landy is a professional photographer who produced many pictures in the 60s, some of Dylan (most notably the covers of Nashville Skyline and Tarantula--w/ Dylan sitting at the piano in the seersucker coat). I have a book of Landy's work, and in it he jokes that people regularly assume that he is an alias of Dylan. Unless this Landy reference is to something else, it should be corrected.</p>

<p>It looks like another edit war is approaching, since James Nicol has repeatedly tried to make major edits to the page, often with overtly POV statements, though not always so. I've reverted a few times already, but it doesn't seem anyone else agrees with me, since they simply keep on making minor edits right after Nicol has drastically changed the page.

<dd>Like you, I disagree with a good deal of the new material inserted in Nicol's edit, which often has the NPOV/NOR problems you mention. On the other hand, much of the material Nicol deleted had the same sort of NPOV/NOR problems. I think it's better to deal with the problems individually rather than simply reverting a legitimately "Be Bold" edit; the article has certainly been bloated by excessively subjective material. I'll "restore" a few of Nicol's deletions of such material; see what you think. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:54, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I guess that i should join the discussion as i recently revised this article. My goal was to remove much of the bias &amp; the shallow observations &amp; unwarranted statements. I see Wikipedia as informative. Articles should stick to the facts, and where the facts come from, whenever possible, should be mentioned. Articles should not be hagiographic. Although those who write about a subject (Bob Dylan, Aristophanes, Lao Tzu, &amp;c.) will probably be those who are interested in &amp; admire said subject, the article must be willing to acknowledge all facets of the subject dispassionately: the good, the bad, the mediocre.</p>
<p>Greatly interested in Bob Dylan's work, I thought to look into Wikipedia's article. When i saw the number of vague &amp; unwarranted statements (the countercultural stuff, all the citing of "critical response", &amp;c.) plus the unreasonable &amp; tasteless plugging of <i>"Love &amp; Theft"</i>, i chose to clean up the article. I may have left or included some of my own bias, but i tried not to write a statement that cannot be substantiated.</p>
<p>(By the way, although i know how to revise articles, i don't know how to enter my remarks here. I hope that i have done it correctly. If not, then please forgive &amp; instruct.)<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 03:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I agree, in general terms, with many of the revisions you made (and reinstated several of your major changes/deletions); but there were some serious problems in details (and POV) in some of the new material added, and, unfortunately, you unfortunately, undid some very painfully negotiated compromise language, especially with regard to Dylan's "born-again" period. I'm going to go back through the article tonight and, I expect, reinstate even more of your revisions. [But not Joan Collins&#160;;-)] And, with that as a middle ground, we can all work on other differences and details. And, while I'm here, I'll note that I've again revised the contentiously argued history of Dylan's signing with Columbia: the only two people who were there for the event, Dylan and Hammond, both say in their autobiographies that Dylan signed on the same day he recorded with Carolyn Hester, which Columbia studio records list as September 29, 1961 (though some sources say September 30); and Robert Shelton, in No Direction Home, says Dylan told him about the signing on September 29. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 04:06, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks, Dude, for enlightening me about the terms &amp; something of the minefield into which i've stepped. As to the "born-again" issue(s), please see above where i discuss, briefly, the frequent misuse of the term "secular". Although i don't think that this is needed in face-to-face discussions, w/ an issue like Christianity in contemporary America, perhaps we serious Wikipedia-Dylanists should announce our own religious stances to demonstrate no ulterior motives. As far as religion is concerned, i am a student of many but a non-believer in any. Many have maligned Dylan's evangelistic songs &amp; many others have, usually for reasons of joint belief, touted them. I stand outside both those opinions. There are obviously songs (&amp; performances) of quality on each of the albums in the born-again trilogy ("Slow Train", "I Believe In You", "Saved", "Every Grain Of Sand"), but one could hardly argue that any of them is more interesting than <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i> or <i>Tangled Up In Blue</i> while certainly being more interesting than, say, <i>Knocked Out Loaded</i> or <i>Under The Red Sky</i>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see this Wikipedia article show this kind of consideration &amp;, when it proffers critical opinion, that it does so w/ great deliberation &amp; substance. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 06:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry James Nicol, I guess I <i>was</i> being shortsighted a little bit. I won't stand in your way if you want to improve the article; just make sure you're careful you don't replace some of the currently Dylan-friendly POV with Dylan-critical POV. I honestly thought someone had vandalized the page when I read what it said about Masked &amp; Anonymous originally. Yeah, it's probably crap by most film standards, but I don't think we can say that without qualification in an encyclopedia article. Who knows? Maybe the movie will age well.

<p>"Given your history on this page and on Adolf Hitler" -- It is very interesting that you here combine two very different pages: The Wiki article about Bob Dylan and the one about Adolf Hitler. You will have your reasons for that mixture, no doubt.</p>
<p>You should nonetheless take into consideration that you are just a Wikipedian, you have no rights except those which every Wikipedian has: To utter her or his personal opinion. Beyond this, you make use of your privilege as an admin. An admin is someone who can "protect" or (which makes no sense at all) "_semi_-protect" any Wikipedia article. This is what makes some admins to feel they are something special, but they are not. An admin, within the Wikipedia world, is not someone like a writer for the Encyclopedia Britanica or the German Brockhaus. No, s/he is just some writer. That is it. And this is all.

<p>It has long been Wikipedia policy where someone has changed their name legally, is known by a shortened version of it, or has adopted a stage name, always to start a biographical article with their original name and follow the chronological changes in name in the opening paragraph, eg, <b>X</b>, (known later as <b>Y</b>) (born whenever) . It is not WP policy to start with a later name adopted and work backwards, in the form of <b>X</b> (born <b>X</b>) (born whenever). And it is contrary to all WP rules to include any other information in the bracketed DOB-DOD or born section. Writing "(born &lt;name&gt; in &lt;whenever&gt;) is absolutely not standard on WP. (Some editors of WP articles on film stars began adding in where people were born and died in the brackets. Those edits are all being deleted to confirm to standard.</p>
<p>WP standard biographical structure is followed in all WP articles and all articles that deviate from it, often due to the fact that an editor did not know the standard format, are being systematically rewritten to confirm to the standard format agreed by consensus. Hence the article on Tony Blair calls him by his full name in the opening, not Tony Blair. The article on Cary Grant names him as Archibald Leach and then explains that he adopted a different name. <i>That</i> is WP policy. Encyclopaedias by their nature have to follow the same format for naming, and not have each article written based on whims of individual pages. As per the standard format the opening has been rewritten to confirm to WP policy. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:35, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cat Stevens' name is a separate (and much more complex) issue IMO.

<p>To wit: "… the subject's full name should be given in the lead paragraph … In some cases, subjects have changed their names at some point after birth. In these cases the birth name should be given as well:</p>

</ul>
<p>The subjects full name in this case is <b>Bob Dylan</b>, right? (or is it in fact "Robert Dylan" oops, probably should have looked that one up) But anyway, doesn't matter, Robert or Bob, my point remains.</p>

I didnt find anything searching the talk page, but it'd be great to see some facts discussed / posted on the article about Dylan's potential Laureate status. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/o/o/User%7ESoorej_5d05.html" title="User:Soorej">Soorej</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/o/User_talk%7ESoorej_663a.html" title="User talk:Soorej">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Soorej_25c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Soorej">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"List of people likened to Bob Dylan"</span></h2>
<p>One of the few things -- the very few things -- that there's been a sustained consensus in this article was that the fairly arbitrary lists should be cut out, and, with virtually no dispute, they have been, making the article better and more readable. For reasons that make no sense to me, when the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_likened_to_Bob_Dylan_1930.html" title="List of people likened to Bob Dylan">List of people likened to Bob Dylan</a> was nominated for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_people_likened_to_Bob_Dylan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_people_likened_to_Bob_Dylan" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> here, the decision was made to "merge" the list into this article, even though only one (of about 15) of the editors in that debate thought it was appropriate. So one badly referenced paragraph was added, then the whole list added by another editor. The whole list is obviously inappropriate, the short version is just an arbitrary collection of white male guitar-playing over-50 Anglo-American singer-songwriters that misrepresents Dylan's influence. The funniest part of the whole thing is that the citation for Elvis Costello doesn't go to a page which likens him to Dylan -- it goes to an interview where Costello blasts critics for likening every halfway decent songwriter to Dylan. Is there any disagreement about the "merge" being a bad idea? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:30, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disputed signing date</span></h2>
<p>Months ago in an edit summary i gave my sources for an October signing date (one of them is now an inline ref.) Mdude claims he has contradctory sources but does not give proper citations allowing a check of his claim <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 09:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dylan's Signing with Columbia</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks the the relatively amicable period here is coming to an end, since <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">User:JDG</a> is back inserting the same unsourced and inaccurate texts that he has been pushing before. The first issue is Dylan's well-documented signing with Columbia. In spite of the fact that every major, first-hand source gives the same account -- that Hammond signed Dylan immediately after his first Columbia recording sessions as a sideman (for Carolyn Hester), on September 29, 1961, a date verified by Columbia's session records and by other sources. Dylan's account is in Chronicles (p278-80); Hammond's in his own autobiography; Robert Shelton, who wrote the Times review, heard the story firsthand from Dylan, and gives the same account in No Direction Home (p.110-113); other reliable Dylan biographies give the same date (e.g., Heylin, Behind The Shades (p60-62). <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">User:JDG</a>'s source is non-existent -- he links to a dead webpage of no particular authority. I can't conceive of a reason to reject the account that Dylan and Hammond both give of the signing, especially since it's confirmed by other sources, and the alternate version fails the standards of the recently toughened <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which calls for reliance on reliable published sources whenever possible.<br />
As several editors have commented, the article is painfully short on reliable references, and, if past experience is a guide, the dispute that's being unnecessarily restarted today will involve proposed insertions of material that has no sources whatsoever. Before things get out of hand again, can we get a working consensus that changes which can't be reliably sourced will be removed, no matter who makes them, and that whatever material remains in the article which can't be sourced under the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards will be removed until satisfactory sources can be provided? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 09:42, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Prince of Amicable speaks! Of course it was amicable. None of the people who usually keep you honest have been around... Finally, you have given page numbers for your sources. We're getting somewhere. Would you now kindly give us the text that shows the signing happened in September, contrary to the undead link in the article? If you can supply this text I will then exert myself to check the other sources mentioned months ago (this entails a trip to the library).

<dd>I check page 277-280 in chronicles and it gives no hard dates - it does discuss his signing to hammond.

<p>I think we should have some lyrics in the article - they can illustrate a point. But the lyrics from "a hard rain's a gonna fall" looks basically like a big chunk of text picked straight from the lyrics - they aren't being used to illustrate a point. "the lyrics are contemplative and hard hitting" does not really justify the length of quote that is there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Times They Are a-Changin an anthem?</span></h2>
<p>I don't want to go back and forth reverting. So what do folks say? In my opinion, while TTAAC does not mention civil rights specifically, it was taken as referring to that when it came out in 1963 <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, since Bob wrote lots of Civil Rights stuff, like Hattie Carroll and Emmett Till. Also because of lines referring to things like a "battle outside ragin'" that would shake the windows and rattle the walls of the Congress and Senate (what ELSE could that refer to?)</p>
<p>In my recollection, "Times" was taken to heart by the Civil Rights crowd when it came out, and by the anti-war crowd some years after it came out. <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> That is certainly how I have always taken it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I’ll admit that there are probably references to civil right in the song (in my opinion, “the slow one now will later be fast”), but a couple amateur interpretations of a song by you or I is not enough to say that it was <b>in fact</b> an anthem for the civil rights and anti-war activists. Did such activists cite it as an anthem? Did they sing it during demonstrations? Even so, Dylan sang "When the Ship Comes In" at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_on_Washington_1a78.html" title="March on Washington">March on Washington</a>, does that make it an anthem? Think critically, and <i>please</i>, cite some sources. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 19:45, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Don't stand in the doorway" -- like George Wallace did to stop desegregation of an Alabama college - I thought everyone understood that oblique reference.

<dd>Sorry Elvrum, but it was most certainly anthemic and a rallying cry song for millions at the time (I remember it well-- how old are you?). <i>Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call</i> - that doesn't sound political to you? Most of all was the line: <i>Come mothers and fathers/Throughout the land/And don't criticize/What you can't understand/Your sons and your daughters/Are beyond your command</i>. The older generations were the ones, by and large, with the repressive racial views, and they were the ones sending us to Vietnam to die for their geopolitical paranoias. That single line could accurately be called the rallying cry of the decade... So, it would be nice if you would do the honors... <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 23:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, please note that I'm <b>not</b> disputing the "anthemic quality" of the song, although I mistyped that in my last revert. I believe I said on your talk page that such was not my intention. I would just like to see a realible source stating that the song was in fact an anthem of civil rights and anti-war activists. And in response to your inquiry on my talk page, I don't dispute the same statement regarding "Blowing in the Wind" because <i>No Direction Home</i>, which I consider a reliable source, makes a similar statement. Is has nothing to do with my own subjective interpretation of either song. <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Land_is_Your_Land_327d.html" title="This Land is Your Land">This Land is Your Land</a> might have made a good national anthem for America, but that doesn't make it so. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 23:58, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whatever you write on this page, it will not touch Bob Dylan. He has done what he had to do. He wrote and sang his songs. Many of these songs will be sung by our grandchildren and their grandchildren. By that time, Bob Dylan will have become an old singer from the past. They will be humming his melodies and maybe remember one or the other line of lyrics. They may ask their grandpa "do you know how the words go on?", and grandpa will certainly ask his grandma "what were the words, you must know, you heard them right out from his mouth, remember the melody Hhm hm hmm hmm hm hm hhhmmm..." And then the grandma of grandpa will tell her GRANDchildren the whole story of a young man, who once left his home town to New York, where he found the life so much easier than... And she will tell not only the story of Bob Dylan, she will sing it in the finest way: Every note and all the words. The kids will not understand the words, since they are too young, they will only internalize the melodies. Later on, they might hum a note or two on the cradle of their baby. Well, Bob Dylan is a historic figure, he will not get the Nobel prize, he does not care, he will have his melodies sung as long as a voice exists.

<p>Well, when we have The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, then we might be forced to open up a new encyclopedic chapter within this Wikipedia article.

It's the culmination of over thirty years of dedicated research and scholarship by Michael Gray.</p>
<p>Inside these pages, you'll find a world of ideas, facts, and opinions. It's a world in which Baudelaire flows on from the Basement Tapes and A.S. Byatt looks out at the Byrds; in which Far from the Madding Crowd follows Ezekiel and Bob Geldof introduces Jean Genet; and in which Hank and William Carlos Williams stand side by side while J.R.R. Tolkien trails the Titanic. Most of all, of course, it's a world in which everyone and everything interconnects, in endlessly fascinating ways, with one of our greatest living artists: Bob Dylan."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Baby Blue"</span></h2>
<p>I've just read the Dylan article, it's very good indeed. Just one thing though, since when was the version of "Baby Blue" on BIABH a lengthy "acoustic" song? Jake.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I believe it is four six line verses and a harmonica solo and come in at under at minutes. hardly lenthy when compared to "Sad eyed lady" or "Desolation Row" or even "mr. Tamborine" man which is on the same album. I'm not sure why you put "accoustic" in quotes however. I would certainly consider the song to be accoustic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.22.178.148 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.22.178.148_931c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.22.178.148">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>I put "acoustic" because he's backed on the track with electric guitar, electric bass guitar and drums. The latter kit of instruments of course being,"acoustic" (there I've done it again), but I'd hardly call it an acoustic track. Jake.</dd>
<dd>I can't hear any drums on Baby Blue Jake, but your'e right about the electric guitar and bass though, so I'd hardly call it accoustic. As for it being lengthy, is 4:23 lengthy? "Beatlemad".</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Add Smithsonian Education link?</span></h2>
<p>Hello! I am a writer for the Smithsonian's Center for Education, which publishes Smithsonian in Your Classroom, a magazine for teachers. Our most recent issue brings Bob Dylan into a study of music and poetry. An online version is available for free download at this address:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/resource_library/publications_siyc_spring2006.html" class="external free" title="http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/resource_library/publications_siyc_spring2006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/resource_library/publications_siyc_spring2006.html</a></p>
<p>If you think that your audience would find this issue valuable, I wish to invite you to include a link to our site. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>The lessons in this issue introduce students to the rhythms of poetry. The focus in on two poetic forms that originated as forms of song: the ballad stanza, found throughout British and American literature, and the blues stanzas of Langston Hughes.</p>
<p>It is not, then, an issue devoted to Dylan's work. But as far as I know there are no other lesson plans on the Web that include Dylan. Smithsonian Folkways Recordings built a special audio page to accompany the issue. The tracks include one of Dylan's earliest recordings, "The Ballad of Donald White." This audio page is directly accessible from our site.</p>

But Nlu has not so much an idea of Bob Dylan. What he does is on his own sake. Here is a short draft of his thinking: 1) I am an admin. 2) Hence I can revert everthing. 3) What I do not like, that I can revert. 4) I do not like the contribution of X, so I revert it. 5) I do not like my reverts to be reverted, so I protect this article, 6) although I have not any argument at hand, I just _protect_ this article, 7) since later I will win the race.</p>

<dd>I don't want to seem harsh, but BD has been saying that wasn't a "spokesman for a generation" since about 1966. That's nothing new. The socially conscious civil rights anthems he wrote covered about a year-and-a-half of his very long career, and he was about 22 years old.</dd>

<p>The poverty of "attitude": Anyone who makes emptiness seem a possibility is bound to be popular with the at least semi-intelligent. Most heroes of the post-war West represent the hope that life is only a matter of wearing the right attitude (and so all questions are answered).

<p>I have reinserted the link to the study, Come In, She Said, I'll Give You Shelter From The Storm. Someone had removed it because they said it had nothing to with Dylan, except the title. That person is wrong, as anyone who reads it can simply see. It is a commentary on a certain aspect of his work, just as other links in that section are.

<dd>I would appreciate if you could explain it somewhat then, I have looked at it, and what I see is a bunch of quotes from the bible with absolutely no explanation how they pertain to dylan. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 16:08, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am writing this in response to SECProto's request for an explanation of the article "'Come in,' She said, 'I'll Give You Shelter From the Storm,'" which SECProto has been removing the link to because he/she says "I have looked at it, and what I see is a bunch of quotes from the bible with absolutely no explanation how they pertain to dylan."</p>
<p>With all due respect to SECProto, what you say is not there, actually is. And here it is -</p>
<p>The article starts with a quote from the chorus of Bob's song Shelter From the Storm, and with a reference to the album it is from. After quoting some Bible verses which are directly relative to Bob's thought about a feminine person giving him "shelter from the storm," the reader is asked "Who is this Woman who desires to give us 'Shelter from the Storm?'</p>
<p>Following this, there is an explanation of some of the feminine imagery in the Bible with an explanation of how that relates to Bob Dylan and the above question under consideration. That portion reads,</p>
<p>"Whenever reading or thinking of the Holy Spirit [Ruah, in Hebrew], Moses and the other Old Testament writers, Jesus, and His Hebrew/Aramaic speaking apostles and disciples, Bob Dylan, or anyone else with a basic understanding of the Hebrew Scriptures, would see a feminine Person."</p>
<p>In the Wiki article on Dylan there are other links which compare him to other poets and writers, and other singer/songwriters which may have influenced him, or to which people see in him a likeness. For some reason all of those commentaries are acceptable, but mine isn't. The only difference between mine and the other unmolested ones is that while the others draw likenesses to what may be generally termed "secular" people, mine shows a commonality Bob has with "Moses and the other Old Testament writers, Jesus, and His Hebrew/Aramaic speaking apostles and disciples."</p>
<p>While others who write commentary on Dylan hold up those who they think people see as heroes, or as extraordinary, I am simply doing the same thing with one who Bob, himself, says is his "hero." That is, "Jesus Christ." I can say this is the truth because Bob said it in the opening of the video Hard To Handle. He has always tried to give credit where credit is do.</p>
<p>The whole on-going debate among some Wiki editors of the Dylan article about whether or not he is a Christian, and just when he became one (if he every really did), is to me lamentable. I don't understand why people just don't take him at his word, and look to his music as the fruits of his beliefs. In the recent 60 Minutes interview Ed Bradley, Bob said that he made a deal with "Destiny" early on in his career. Later Ed asked him more about the "Destiny" matter, and Bob explained it by saying that he had made a deal with "the Captain." When Ed said something to the effect "the captain of this world," Bob said "of this world, and the unseen one" (or to that effect).</p>
<p>People say that he is no longer a Christian because he left the particular fellowship he had been involved with, yet the very last verse of the Sugar Baby, the last song on his last album, is "Look up. Look up. See your Maker, before Gabriel blows his horn." Others say that he did not become a Christian until the mid-to-late 70s. Yet on his 1970 album New Morning, the last song Father of Night ends with the words "Father of Whom we most solemnly praise." Who was that "Whom" he was speaking of, other than Jesus? That was years before he made his public profession.</p>
<p>The story I heard of his "born again" experience as it relates to his "straight testimony" albums, was simply that he met a preacher who convinced him that he shouldn't let people be misled as to what was the motivating factor in what he did, and that he needed to make his somewhat hidden belief in the Gospel known. That is, that Bob shouldn't let the devil (sex, drugs, and rock and roll) get the credit for his inspiration and success, when he knew well better that it was that "Precious Angel" who was a "Special Rider" guiding his reins (as he allowed her).</p>
<p>Many musicians have used their music to preach the Gospel (Good News) in metaphors and similes (parables, if you will). Amy Grant comes to mind, in that she started out as a Gospel singer, and crossed over onto what is called the secular arena in order to share her love of God. I see Bob as having done the opposite - at first going into the secular venue (though at that time religious themes were not as unpopular as they are today, and were a part of the music scene he was a part of), and then going into an openly evangelical forum. All he has done since then is go back to the broader field of story/parable type of presentations. It's all the same - Bob wants to love God, and vice-versa. When asked in that same 60 Minutes interview how he got inspired in the early days to write, he said that he would just play a "Protestant hymn," and things would come to him. He must have had a personal affinity for those "hymns" from a personal experience with the motivating factor behind them - the Captain, and His Bride.</p>
<p>With that said, I'll go back to the article/link under discussion -- In order to more fully explain Bob's use of the feminine imagery of the Bible, I have to explain to the English-speaking reader that imagery as it exists in Hebrew and Aramaic because it is lost in the Greek, Latin, and English translations. Then, after laying down that foundation, I go back to how all of that relates to Bob and the song under consideration by introducing this section -</p>
<p>"BOB DYLAN AND WISDOM, HIS FRIEND</p>
<p>"In the Book of Proverbs the Holy Ghost is characterized as Wisdom, the Divine feminine Intercessor. In his song, Shelter from the Storm, Bob Dylan is simply telling of the Holy Ghost's [Divine Wisdom's] work in his spiritual rebirth — Her, the Daughter of Gods work. 'Come in,' She said [to him, and you and me], 'I’ll give you shelter from the storm.'"</p>
<p>I am sorry that SECProto seemed to have missed that part, as it is probably the most straightforward and simplest explanation of the theme of the article and how it pertains to Bob Dylan. Following that, I bring in some quite specific Bible quotes about Wisdom (feminine in Hebrew) calling unto people in the same manner and for the same purpose which Bob was writing of, in order to better nail the subject in place. Those quotes are about Wisdom calling us in so that we may find shelter and life. Here are those quotes</p>
<p>"...She crieth upon the highest places of the city, Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, She saith to him, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding." Proverbs 9:3-6.</p>
<p>"She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon Her: and happy is every one that retaineth Her." Proverbs 3:18.</p>
<p>Following that I tie that feminine imagery into some of Bob's songs, as follows,</p>
<p>"Precious Angel, under the Sun, how was I to know You'd be the one. To show me I was blinded; to show me I was gone; how weak was the foundation, I was standing upon. Shine Your light. Shine Your light on me. Shine Your light. You know I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see...You’re the Queen of my flesh Girl, you’re my Woman, you’re my delight." Precious Angel, by Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>And then another,</p>
<p>"If not for you, Babe, I couldn’t find the door, couldn’t even see the floor. I’d be sad and blue, if not for You..." If Not For You, by Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>And then some titles of more songs which contain more of the same imagery,</p>
<p>"Under Your Spell, Your Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go, Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love), You Angel You, Covenant Woman, etc., by Bob Dylan - singing Her Praises before the nations."</p>
<p>And then I finish up by tying the whole thing back to Shelter From The Storm by quoting the last verse which is one of the deepest lines he has ever written, that is,</p>
<p>“If I could only turn back the clock to when God [Jesus] and Her [the Holy Ghost] were born, “'Come in,' She said 'I'll give you shelter from the storm.' ”</p>
<p>I could add much more commentary on the rest of the song, or even write a book about these subjects underlying all of his songs, and have it published. Maybe then it would rate enough to be let on the Misc. Section as are other commentary/comparison writings. But just because mine is relatively brief is no reason to exclude it from being available to those who ponder the knowledge which motivates Dylan's imagery.</p>
<p>In the 2 or so weeks it was on the article before it was removed (again), we received about 65 visitors from the link. Prior to that, before it was removed at another an earlier time, we were getting about 100 visitor's a month from the link. That is when it had the brief explanation of the article being about the Judeo-Christian feminine imagery in Bob's songs. Evidently some people were interested in the subject. So why not allow Wiki to be just that - anyone.</p>
<p>Another person complained that the article was not fit for an encyclopedia format. If that's true, then neither are a number of the other miscellaneous links, and even some of the paragraphs that are in the article itself, for they are highly opinionated, or speculative.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think the article is getting too long. His life and music require some space.</p>
<p>So, does that answer your question, SECProto? Peace. Anyone7 10:20 CST, June 25, 2006</p>

<dd>Yeah, I can see how it pertains to Dylan now. But it is still explained somewhat poorly on the linked page. I'm not going to continue to remove it. However, as you stated, some of the links and even paragraphs in this article are poorly written. This is definately true, the links section as a whole pretty much sucks. Having some bad links doesn't really excuse someone to add other poor links, but rather, to remove the bad ones which are already there. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 18:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bob Dylan's rainy day women song doesn't have an article. There is an article Rainy day women that is heavily related to it. However, it seems to be plagiarized or something. So this needs to be taken care of and maybe this information can be used in creating an article for the song.

(BTW, "references" or "notes" are sources used in writing the article, "further reading" are not) Could some of the main contributors to the article please try to fix this problem so FAR isn't needed?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Portrait</span></h2>
<p>On 23rd September I suggested adding a recent portrait, seeing as Bob Dylan is still alive. I've found one that I think is appropriate, but needs confirmation of copyright etc. Firstly, could one of you more experienced people sort it out? Considering the lack of a modern portrait I have suggested it constitues fair use of a copyrighted image. Secondly, could somebody please upload it, if and as appropirate?</p>
<p>It has been suggested that it should be near the top somewhere due to its significance, although it's obviously up to the main editors of this page. The image is:</p>

<p>Well, its a good shot, but dylan doesn't have long or straight hair at this point, so perhaps something from his site would work better. And I definitley think an old photo should remain the main shot of Dylan. His most easily recognizable form should be presented at the get go as wiki is at its finest when it serves as a quick reminder and an extension of referential memory.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThechosenone021_3d5d.html" title="User:Thechosenone021">User:thechosenone021</a> 03:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Point taken, and I notice the main photo has been changed. Can I suggest that this picture gives the best impression of Dylan's age at the moment and until we find a more accurate picture in terms of hair (and also the live use of guitar is generally inaccurate at the present time), that this picture should be used in that interim period? I'd hate to see such a nice picture go to waste. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_allemany_a461.html" title="User:Levi allemany">Levi allemany</a> 15:12, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure, Throw it in for that one at the bottom under recent live performances after reformatting it. The current distant stage shot is basically useless. And yeah, i would get someone else to work out copyrights, I know i don't know how that works.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThechosenone021_3d5d.html" title="User:Thechosenone021">Thechosenone021</a> 21:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dunno, you might want to think again JKelly. Dylan is a pretty unique entity in this. It's fair to say no other artist has as large and active an Internet presence. Sure, you'll find far more Britney or 50 Cent "fan sites" out there, but typically all but one or two have no depth and go stale within weeks. Dylan-related sites, in contrast, are around for years, have copius materials and databases, active forums, news of future shows and releases, etc.,. As I mentioned to Brenneman on his Talk page, many of these links have been here since <b>2002</b>. You have to give some credit there... they are venerable in that way.
