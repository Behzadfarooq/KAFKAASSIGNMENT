<p>Commissioned as a naval officer (as was his father before him) after graduating from <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a> in 1965, Woodward was discharged from the Navy as a Lieutenant in August 1970 after serving as an aide to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_Naval_Operations_f8ba.html" title="Chief of Naval Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, Admiral <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_H._Moorer_8df3.html" title="Thomas H.

<p>He applied to several <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> schools, but also applied for a job as a reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Rosenfeld_b126.html" title="Harry Rosenfeld">Harry Rosenfeld</a>, the paper's metropolitan editor, hired him on a two-week trial basis, a tryout that failed because of his complete lack of experience as a journalist.

A year after his on-the-job training at the <i>Sentinel</i>, he left that paper and joined <i>The Washington Post</i> in August 1971.</p>

Their book about the scandal, <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_the_President%27s_Men_dae7.html" title="All the President's Men">All the President's Men</a></i>, became a #1 best-seller and was later turned into a movie. <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_the_President%27s_Men_%28film%29_7625.html" title="All the President's Men (film)">The 1976 film</a>, starring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Redford_cfb9.html" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> as Woodward and <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustin_Hoffman_be7f.html" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investigative_journalism.html" title="Investigative journalism">investigative journalism</a>.</p>
<p>The book and movie also led to one of Washington, D.C.'s most famous mysteries: the identity of Woodward's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection_of_sources.html" title="Protection of sources">secret</a> Watergate informant known as <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_6937.html" title="Deep Throat">Deep Throat</a>, a reference to the title of a <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28film%29_f946.html" title="Deep Throat (film)">popular pornographic movie</a> at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat's identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For over 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant's identity until it was revealed by his family to <i><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_Fair_%28magazine%29_3c10.html" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> magazine as former <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> Assistant Director <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Mark_Felt_640a.html" title="W.

<p>Woodward has been accused by a few critics of being too close to the Bush administration, and some say his relationship with the current administration is in stark contrast to his investigative role in Watergate. Others disagree, however. In 2004 both the Bush campaign and the Kerry-Edwards campaign recommended his book <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_of_Attack_4143.html" title="Plan of Attack">Plan of Attack</a></i>, and <i>The New York Times</i> said the book contained “convincing accounts of White House failures... presented alongside genial encounters with the president.” Rick Hertzberg in the New Yorker wrote “Plan of Attack” is Woodward’s best book in years" and that "Woodward is welcomed as a fair witness." Woodward's latest book, <i>State of Denial,</i> describes alleged tensions and dysfunctions within the Bush administration in the lead-up to, and following, the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>On Monday, October 2, 2006, Woodward's new book <i>State of Denial</i> was released. Peggy Noonan of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> wrote, "It may be a great (book). It is serious, densely, even exhaustively, reported, and a real contribution to history in that it gives history what it most requires, first-person testimony. It is well documented, with copious notes."</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Woodward_db31.html" title="Edit section: Involvement in the Plame scandal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Involvement in the Plame scandal</span></h4>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Woodward gave a two-hour <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deposition.html" title="Deposition">deposition</a> to Special Counsel <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Fitzgerald_0efc.html" title="Patrick Fitzgerald">Patrick Fitzgerald</a>. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Invasion_of_Iraq_a692.html" title="2003 Invasion of Iraq">Iraq war</a> critic, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_C._Wilson_74b3.html" title="Joseph C. Wilson">Joe Wilson</a>’s wife (later identified as <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Valerie Plame</a>), worked for the CIA. Woodward therefore appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Post_5b91.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, and was the first time Woodward revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Woodward testified the information was given to him in a “casual” and “offhand” manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to “out” Plame as a CIA employee.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501829.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501829.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Later, Woodward's source identified himself. It was Richard Armitage, Colin Powell's deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle.</p>
<p>Woodward said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_of_Attack_4143.html" title="Plan of Attack">Plan of Attack</a></i>. He did not reveal the official’s disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source.</p>
<p>In his deposition, Woodward also said that he had conversations with <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooter_Libby_3b58.html" title="Scooter Libby">Scooter Libby</a> after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Joe Wilson’s wife</a> before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known.</p>
<p>Woodward’s revelation was controversial because he had not told his editor at the <i>Post</i> about the conversation for more than two years, and also because he had publicly criticized the investigation. He had referred to Fitzgerald as a “junkyard dog prosecutor” on <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_King_cd18.html" title="Larry King">Larry King</a>’s television show, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/16/woodward.leak" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/16/woodward.leak" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and said he believed that when “all of the facts come out in this case, it's going to be laughable because the consequences are not that great."<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4732602" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4732602" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. On another occasion, he said of the investigation that he thought there was “nothing to it,” and that Fitzgerald’s behavior had been “disgraceful.” In later interviews after his deposition, Woodward said he had meant by his “junkyard dog” comment to suggest colorfully that Fitzgerald was a tenacious prosecutor, and that the “disgraceful” comment concerned the tactic of putting journalists in prison to coerce them to reveal their confidential sources.</p>
<p>Woodward apologized to Leonard Downie, the editor of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Post_5b91.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting.</p>

<p>Woodward has twice contributed to collective journalistic efforts that were awarded the Pulitzer Prize. In 1973, <i>The Washington Post</i> won the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Public_Service_f279.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for Public Service">Pulitzer Prize for Public Service</a>. Though the Prize was awarded to the entire Post staff, the citation specifically named his and Bernstein's reporting on Watergate as exemplary work. In addition, Woodward was the lead reporter for the <i>Post'</i>s articles on the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks that won the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_National_Reporting_255a.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting">National Reporting</a> Pulitzer in 2002. He also was awarded the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald R. Ford</a> Prize for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency in 2003.</p>
<p>Woodward is widely regarded as one of the top reporters of the last half-century, and has earned trust and accolades from government officials and journalists of all political persuasions. In 2003, Al Hunt of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_Street_Journal_8de1.html" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> called Woodward "the most celebrated journalist of our age." <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weekly_Standard_ccd3.html" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a></i> called him "the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever." In 2004, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Schieffer_3c1c.html" title="Bob Schieffer">Bob Schieffer</a> of <i><a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_News_c061.html" title="CBS News">CBS News</a></i> said "Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time.

<p>In writing his books, Woodward collects detailed records, including interviews, documents, transcripts, and recordings. He then uses them to describe events as a story with an <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omniscient.html" title="Omniscient">omniscient</a> <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrator.html" title="Narrator">narrator</a>, present tense and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a>.

<p>While this style may have earned Woodward commercial success, many literary critics consider his <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose.html" title="Prose">prose</a> awkward and his approach inappropriate for his subject matter. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_von_Hoffman_ec86.html" title="Nicholas von Hoffman">Nicholas von Hoffman</a> complained that "the arrestingly irrelevant detail is [often] used" <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/8829" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/8829" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> while <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Massing_e535.html" title="Michael Massing">Michael Massing</a> thinks the books are "filled with long, at times tedious passages with no evident direction." <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3218" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3218" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Didion_b1d5.html" title="Joan Didion">Joan Didion</a> said Woodward finds "[nothing] too insignificant for inclusion," including such details as shirts worn and food eaten in unimportant situations. "The reader attuned to the conventions of narrative might be led by the presentation of these quotidian details into thinking that a dramatic moment is about to occur," she noted, only to be disappointed by bland comments like how the President "thought a lot of the criticism he received was unfair." <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>The narrative, reporting-driven style of Woodward's books also draws criticism for rarely making conclusions or passing judgment on the characters and actions that he recounts in such detail. Didion concluded that Woodward writes "books in which measurable cerebral activity is virtually absent," and finds the books marked by "a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured."</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_DeLong_53e0.html" title="Brad DeLong">Brad DeLong</a> has also noticed strong inconsistencies between the accounts of the making of Clinton economic policy described both in Woodward's book <i>Maestro</i> and his book <i>The Agenda</i>. <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/why_oh_why_cant.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/why_oh_why_cant.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Didion, meanwhile, complains about inconsistencies even within the same book. On page 16 of <i>The Choice</i>, she notes, Clinton complains about Dole using the Whitewater scandal to attack him the day after his mother passed away. But on page 346, Dole says "he had never used Whitewater to attack the president personally." <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Some of Woodward's critics accuse him of abandoning critical inquiry to maintain his access to high-profile political actors. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Lewis_2ee3.html" title="Anthony Lewis">Anthony Lewis</a> called the style "a trade in which the great grant access in return for glory." <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16050" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16050" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Hitchens_80b0.html" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> accused Woodward of acting as "stenographer to the rich and powerful." <a href="http://www.salon.com/weekly/woodward960701.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/weekly/woodward960701.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>Woodward has said that his books "really are self portraits, because I go to people and I say — I check them and I double check them but — but who are you? What are you doing? Where do you fit in? What did you say? What did you feel?" <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1423" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Critics complain that this style allows the biases and beliefs of his sources to steer the narrative and that those who talk to Woodward are painted more favorably than those who don't.</p>
<p><i>The Brethren</i>, for example, painted a picture of the Supreme Court based partly on the comments of its clerks; some believe that, as a result, the book suggests that the Supreme Court Justices do little of the actual work. Woodward points out recently that the ex-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was one of his primary sources for "State of Denial," yet is perhaps the most harshly portrayed figure in the book. Other sources who have spoken to Woodward also confess to having failed to "spin" him, as they had hoped to do.</p>
<p>Woodward's dual role as journalist and author has opened him up to occasional criticism for sitting on information for publication in a book, rather than presenting it sooner when it might affect the events at hand. In <i>The Commanders</i> (1991), for instance, he indicated that <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a> had opposed <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Storm_afe2.html" title="Operation Desert Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a>, yet Woodward did not publish this information before Congress voted on a war resolution, when it may have made a difference. And in <i>Veil</i>, he indicates that former CIA Director <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Casey_0364.html" title="William Casey">William Casey</a> personally knew of arms sales to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contra.html" title="Contra">Contras</a>, but he did not reveal this until after the Congressional investigation.</p>
<p>Woodward has also been accused of exaggeration and fabrication by other journalists, most notably regarding "<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28Watergate%29_b144.html" title="Deep Throat (Watergate)">Deep Throat</a>", his famous Watergate informant. Before he was revealed to be W. Mark Felt, some contended that Deep Throat was a composite character based on more than one Watergate source.</p>
<p>Martin Dardis, the chief investigator for the Dade County State Attorney, who in 1972 discovered that the money found on the Watergate burglars came from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_to_Re-elect_the_President_a482.html" title="Committee to Re-elect the President">Committee to Re-elect the President</a>, has complained that <i>All the President's Men</i> misrepresented him.</p>
<p>Woodward was also accused of fabricating his deathbed interview with Casey, as described in <i>Veil</i>; critics say the interview simply could not have taken place as written in the book. However, the CIA's own internal report found that Casey spoke to Woodward 43 times, sometimes alone at Casey's home, and his deputy Bob Gates wrote in his own book that he was able to communicate with Casey at that same time and quoted Casey making short statements similar to those reported by Woodward. The author Ronald Kessler reported similar findings in his book on the CIA.</p>
<p>Finally, a review by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Lewis_2ee3.html" title="Anthony Lewis">Anthony Lewis</a> in the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Review_of_Books_bbed.html" title="New York Review of Books">New York Review of Books</a></i> challenged the claim in <i>The Brethren</i> (written by Woodward and Scott Armstrong) that Supreme Court Justice <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Brennan_a052.html" title="William Brennan">William Brennan</a> once voted in a way he thought was wrong to avoid hurting the feelings of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Blackmun_6534.html" title="Justice Blackmun">Justice Blackmun</a>. Woodward and Armstrong insisted they had one of Brennan's clerks confirm the story on the record; Lewis interviewed everyone who clerked that term; all found the story false or implausible. Woodward showed the notes he'd taken on the subject to a third-party; the notes themselves were unclear but Lewis located the source of the notes who insisted that Woodward misrepresented him. <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7533" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7533" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Despite these criticisms and challenges, Woodward has been praised as an authoritative and balanced journalist. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_Book_Review_6e64.html" title="The New York Times Book Review">The New York Times Book Review</a></i> said in 2004 that "No reporter has more talent for getting Washington’s inside story and telling it cogently." The publication of a Woodward book, perhaps more than any other contemporary author's, is treated as a major political event that dominates national news for days.</p>
<p>Commentator <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Frum_a7b8.html" title="David Frum">David Frum</a> has said, perhaps partly tongue-in-cheek, that Washington officials can learn something about the way Washington works from Woodward's books: "From his books, you can draw a composite profile of the powerful Washington player. That person is highly circumspect, highly risk averse, eschews new ideas, flatters his colleagues to their face (while trashing them to Woodward behind their backs), and is always careful to avoid career-threatening confrontation. We all admire heroes, but Woodward's books teach us that those who rise to leadership are precisely those who take care to abjure heroism for themselves."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
