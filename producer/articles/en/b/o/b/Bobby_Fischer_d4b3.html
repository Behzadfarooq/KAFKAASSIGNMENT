<p><b>Robert James "Bobby" Fischer</b> (born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>) is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>-born <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster_%28chess%29.html" title="Grandmaster (chess)">Grandmaster</a> and in 1972 became the only US-born chessplayer to become the official <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_2131.html" title="World Chess Championship">World Chess Champion</a>. In 1975 he officially resigned the title when <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_des_%C3%89checs_85f5.html" title="Fédération Internationale des Échecs">FIDE</a>, the international chess federation, refused to accept his conditions for a title defense. He is considered by many to be one of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_chess_player_of_all_time.html" title="Greatest chess player of all time">greatest chess players of all time</a>.</p>
<p>Fischer's victory over the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> world champion <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Spassky_b782.html" title="Boris Spassky">Boris Spassky</a> in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_1972_4b5f.html" title="World Chess Championship 1972">1972 World Chess Championship</a> not only sparked heightened international interest in chess, but was seen as a symbolic victory for the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> West. Particularly in the United States, Spassky was portrayed as the product of an impersonal, mechanical, and oppressive system of state control, while Fischer was depicted as a solitary genius who had heroically overcome the Soviets' dominance.</p>
<p>Fischer now lives in <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and has also become known for his <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">anti-Americanism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-imperialism.html" title="Anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>. However, Fischer's inflammatory statements have done little to diminish the professional and popular recognition of his singular achievements on the chessboard.</p>

His mother, Regina Wender, was a naturalized American citizen, of German Jewish<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> descent, who was born in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, raised in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and later became a teacher, registered nurse, and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">physician</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Fischer's father was listed on the birth certificate as Wender's first husband, Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, a German biophysicist; the couple married in 1933 in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.S.R._11e6.html" title="U.S.S.R.">U.S.S.R.</a>, where Wender was studying medicine at the First Moscow Medical Institute. However, a 2002 article by Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer_f265.html" title="The Philadelphia Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a></i> suggests that <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Nemenyi_874d.html" title="Paul Nemenyi">Paul Nemenyi</a>, a Hungarian physicist of Jewish ancestry, may have been Fischer's biological father.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Gerhardt and Regina Fischer divorced in 1945 when Bobby was two years old, and he grew up with his mother and older sister, Joan. In 1948, the family moved to <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile%2C_Arizona_d48e.html" title="Mobile, Arizona">Mobile, Arizona</a>, where Regina taught in an elementary school. The following year they moved to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn%2C_New_York_07be.html" title="Brooklyn, New York">Brooklyn, New York</a>, where Regina worked as an elementary school teacher and nurse.</p>
<p>In May 1949, the six-year-old Fischer learned how to play chess from instructions found in a chess set that his sister had bought at a candy store below their Brooklyn apartment. He saw his first chess book a month later. For over a year he played chess on his own. At age 7, he joined the Brooklyn Chess Club and was taught by its president, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Nigro_7cc6.html" title="Carmine Nigro">Carmine Nigro</a>. He later joined the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> Chess Club. When Fischer was 13, his mother asked <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Collins_7e3d.html" title="John W. Collins">John W. Collins</a> to be his chess tutor. Collins had coached several top players, including future grandmasters <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Byrne_e8d3.html" title="Robert Byrne">Robert Byrne</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lombardy_98ff.html" title="William Lombardy">William Lombardy</a>. Fischer spent much time at Collins' house, and some have described Collins as a father figure for Fischer. The Hawthorne Chess Club was the name for the group which Collins coached. Fischer also was involved with the Log Cabin Chess Club.</p>
<p>Fischer attended <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus_Hall_High_School_1262.html" title="Erasmus Hall High School">Erasmus Hall High School</a> together with <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbra_Streisand_063e.html" title="Barbra Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, though he later dropped out.

<p>Fischer's first real triumph was winning the United States Junior Chess Championship in July 1956. In the same year, he played several brilliant games; his game against <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Byrne_cc79.html" title="Donald Byrne">Donald Byrne</a>, who later became an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Master_99bf.html" title="International Master">International Master</a>, is often called "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_of_the_Century_%28chess%29_87c3.html" title="The Game of the Century (chess)">The Game of the Century</a>".</p>
<p>In 1957, Fischer first successfully defended his U.S. Junior title, then won the United States Open Chess Championship on tie-breaking points over <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Bisguier_b5e9.html" title="Arthur Bisguier">Arthur Bisguier</a>. Fischer was given entry into the invitational U.S. Championship. Many thought he was too weak, and predicted that he would finish last. Instead, he won, becoming in January <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, at age 14, the youngest U.S. champion ever.</p>
<p><a name="World_Championship_Candidate" id="World_Championship_Candidate"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Edit section: World Championship Candidate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World Championship Candidate</span></h2>
<p>Fischer's victory qualified him to participate in the 1958 <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portoroz.html" title="Portoroz">Portoroz</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interzonal.html" title="Interzonal">Interzonal</a>, the next step toward challenging the World Champion. The top six finishers in the Interzonal would qualify for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidates_Tournament_f928.html" title="Candidates Tournament">Candidates Tournament</a>, but few thought the youngster had much chance of this. Again he surprised the pundits, tying for fifth place after a strong finish. This made Fischer the youngest person ever to qualify for the Candidates (a record which was broken by <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnus_Carlsen_56c3.html" title="Magnus Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> in 2005, although Carlsen took one of 16 available places, Fischer took one of 8), and also earned him the title of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster.html" title="Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a>, making him at that time the youngest grandmaster in history.</p>
<p>Before the Candidates' tournament, he competed in 1959 in strong International tournaments at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_del_Plata_9ad5.html" title="Mar del Plata">Mar del Plata</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>; <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago.html" title="Santiago">Santiago</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>; and <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurich.html" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. In all three events, he scored well, showing that he was of true grandmaster strength.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, Fischer finished a creditable equal fifth out of eight at the Candidates Tournament held in <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bled.html" title="Bled">Bled</a>/<a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>/<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in 1959. He scored 12.5-15.5 and was outclassed by tournament winner <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Tal_1aee.html" title="Mikhail Tal">Mikhail Tal</a>, who won all four of their individual games.</p>
<p>In 1960, Fischer tied for first with the young Soviet star <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Spassky_b782.html" title="Boris Spassky">Boris Spassky</a> at the strong <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_del_Plata_9ad5.html" title="Mar del Plata">Mar del Plata</a> tournament in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, with the two well ahead of the rest of the field. Fischer lost only to Spassky, and this was the start of their relationship, which began on a friendly basis and stayed that way, in spite of Fischer's troubles on the board against Spassky. Fischer struggled in the subsequent <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> tournament, finishing with a minus score, as Soviet <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Korchnoi_b7e2.html" title="Viktor Korchnoi">Viktor Korchnoi</a> won. This was the only real failure of Fischer's competitive career.</p>
<p>In 1961, Fischer started a 16-game match with frequent U.S. Champion <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Reshevsky_8f6f.html" title="Samuel Reshevsky">Samuel Reshevsky</a>, one of the world's strongest players. The match was split between <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Despite Fischer's meteoric rise, the veteran Reshevsky was considered the favorite. After 11 games and a tie score (2 wins apiece with 7 draws), the match ended due to a dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_Piatigorsky_c251.html" title="Jacqueline Piatigorsky">Jacqueline Piatigorsky</a>. Mrs. Piatigorsky's husband <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Piatigorsky_69b7.html" title="Gregor Piatigorsky">Gregor Piatigorsky</a>, a world-class concert cellist, was giving a concert later in the afternoon of the scheduled 12th game. Mrs. Piatigorsky, who wanted to attend the concert, as well as the chess game, rescheduled the 12th game to start at 11 a.m., apparently without getting Fischer's approval. Fischer, who liked to sleep late, objected, and abandoned the match. He later made up with Mrs. Piatigorsky, by accepting an invitation to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica_aa1e.html" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a> 1966, which she helped to sponsor.</p>
<p>Fischer was second behind former World Champion Tal at <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bled.html" title="Bled">Bled</a> 1961, a super-strong tournament. He defeated Tal head-to-head for the first time, scored 3.5/4 against the Soviet contingent, and finished as the only unbeaten player.</p>

<p>In the next World Championship cycle, Fischer won the 1962 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> Interzonal by 2.5 points, scoring 17.5-4.5, making him one of the favorites for the Candidates tournament in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Cura%C3%A7ao.html" title="Curaçao">Curaçao</a>, which began soon afterwards. However, he had a disappointing tournament, finishing fourth out of eight with a 14-13 score. The result nonetheless established Fischer, at 19, as the strongest non-Soviet player in the world. Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal's, in spite of Tal's head-to-head dominance, was the only player who visited him in the hospital.</p>
<p>In 1962, Fischer said that he had "personal problems" and began to listen to various radio ministers in a search for answers. This is how he first came to listen to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World_Tomorrow_8705.html" title="The World Tomorrow">The World Tomorrow</a></i> radio program with <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_W._Armstrong_da6a.html" title="Herbert W. Armstrong">Herbert W. Armstrong</a> and his son <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garner_Ted_Armstrong_cabd.html" title="Garner Ted Armstrong">Garner Ted Armstrong</a>; the Armstrongs' denomination, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worldwide_Church_of_God_693c.html" title="Worldwide Church of God">The Worldwide Church of God</a>, predicted an imminent apocalypse. In late 1963, Fischer began <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithe.html" title="Tithe">tithing</a> to the church. According to Fischer, he lived a bifurcated life, with a rational chess component and an enthusiastic religious component.</p>
<p>Following his failure in the 1962 Candidates (at which five of the eight players were from the Soviet Union), Fischer asserted that three of the Soviet players had an agreement to draw their games in order to concentrate on playing against him, and also that a fourth, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Korchnoi_6836.html" title="Victor Korchnoi">Victor Korchnoi</a>, had been forced to throw games to ensure a Soviet player won. It is generally thought that the former accusation is correct, but not the latter. <i>(This is discussed further at the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_1963_30b8.html" title="World Chess Championship 1963">World Chess Championship 1963</a> article)</i>.</p>
<p>Fischer therefore decided not to participate in the <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> Interzonal in 1964, thus taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle. He held to this decision even when FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round-robin_tournament.html" title="Round-robin tournament">round-robin</a> to a series of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-elimination_tournament.html" title="Single-elimination tournament">knockout</a> matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion.</p>
<p>Fischer wanted to play in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capablanca.html" title="Capablanca">Capablanca</a> Memorial Tournament, <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a> 1965, but Americans were not allowed to travel to <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> at that time. Fischer had travelled to Cuba to play as a youth, before <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> assumed power with a coup in 1959. Fischer was able to play by <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraph.html" title="Telegraph">telegraph</a>, staying in New York and playing from the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Marshall_f918.html" title="Frank Marshall">Frank Marshall</a> Chess Club. His games lasted longer because of the transmission delays and receipt of moves logistics. But Fischer finished second, behind former World Champion <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasily_Smyslov_efd9.html" title="Vasily Smyslov">Vasily Smyslov</a>, and defeated Smyslov in their game. Chess became a news item in the United States with this unusual achievement.</p>
<p>Fischer finished second at the 1966 <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica_aa1e.html" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a> supertournament, just behind world finalist <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Spassky_b782.html" title="Boris Spassky">Boris Spassky</a>. The next year, he won over strong fields at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Carlo_9de6.html" title="Monte Carlo">Monte Carlo</a> 1967 and <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skopje.html" title="Skopje">Skopje</a> 1967.</p>
<p>In the next cycle, at the 1967 <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sousse.html" title="Sousse">Sousse</a> Interzonal, Fischer scored a phenomenal 8.5 points in the first 10 games. His observance of the Worldwide Church of God's <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">sabbath</a> was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute. Fischer forfeited two games in protest and later withdrew, eliminating himself from the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> World Championship cycle.</p>

<p>At home, Fischer won all eight U.S. Championships that he competed in, beginning with the 1957-1958 championship and ending with the 1966-1967 championship. This string includes his 11-0 win in the 1963-1964 championship, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament, and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_records_in_chess.html#Perfect_tournament_score" title="World records in chess">one of only a handful of perfect scores ever in high-level chess tournaments</a>.</p>
<p>Fischer was forced to attend school, and had to miss the 1958 Olympiad. But he represented the U.S.A. on top board with great distinction at four <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympiads.html" title="Olympiads">Olympiads</a>: (<a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> 1960, <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varna.html" title="Varna">Varna</a> 1962, <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a> 1966, and <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siegen.html" title="Siegen">Siegen</a> 1970). At Leipzig, he scored 13/18 for the silver medal, and the U.S.A. also won the team silver. At Varna, he scored 11/17 and the U.S.A. finished fourth. At Havana, he scored an incredible 15/17 for the individual silver, and the Americans again won team silver. Then at Siegen he again won silver with 10/13, and the U.S.A. finished fourth. His overall total was +40, =18, -7, for 49/65 or 75.4 per cent. Fischer turned down further invitations to play in 1964, 1968, and 1972, after which he retired for 20 years.</p>
<p>Fischer won the tournaments at <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinkovci.html" title="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a> 1968 and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netanya.html" title="Netanya">Netanya</a> 1968 by large margins.

<p>The 1969 U.S. Championship was also a zonal qualifier, with the top three finishers advancing to the Interzonal. Fischer, however, had sat out the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. To enable Fischer to compete for the title, Grandmaster <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/l/P%C3%A1l_Benk%C5%91_345e.html" title="Pál Benkő">Pál Benkő</a> gave up his Interzonal place, for which the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Chess_Federation_9133.html" title="United States Chess Federation">United States Chess Federation</a> (USCF) paid him a modest $2,000; the other zonal participants waived their right to replace Benkő. This unusual arrangement was the work of <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Edmondson_%28chess_official%29_6fe2.html" title="Ed Edmondson (chess official)">Ed Edmondson</a>, then the USCF's Executive Director.</p>
<p>Before the Interzonal, though, in March and April 1970, the world's best players competed in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia_%28USSR%29_vs_Rest_of_the_World_f92d.html" title="Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World">USSR vs. Rest of the World</a> match in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Fischer graciously agreed to allow <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bent_Larsen_71e0.html" title="Bent Larsen">Bent Larsen</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> to play first board for the Rest of the World team in light of Larsen's recent outstanding tournament results, even though Fischer had the higher <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating.html" title="Elo rating">Elo rating</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> The USSR team won the match by a hair (20.5-19.5), but Fischer beat <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigran_Petrosian_24db.html" title="Tigran Petrosian">Tigran Petrosian</a>, whom <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Spassky_b782.html" title="Boris Spassky">Boris Spassky</a> had dethroned as <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_2131.html" title="World Chess Championship">world champion</a> the previous year, 3-1, winning the first two games and drawing the last two.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later in 1970, Fischer won tournaments at <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, where he crushed the field of mostly Grandmasters with 15/17. Clearly, he had taken his game to a new, stratospheric level.</p>
<p>The Interzonal was held in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palma_de_Mallorca_46c4.html" title="Palma de Mallorca">Palma de Mallorca</a> in November and December 1970. Fischer won it with a remarkable 18.5-4.5 score, 3.5 points ahead of Larsen, <a href="../../../e/f/i/Efim_Geller_8c10.html" title="Efim Geller">Efim Geller</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_H%C3%BCbner_bad6.html" title="Robert Hübner">Robert Hübner</a>, who tied for second at 15-8.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Fischer finished the tournament with seven consecutive wins (one by default).</p>
<p>Fischer continued his domination in the 1971 Candidates matches, defeating his opponents with a lopsided series of results unparalleled in chess history. He crushed both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Taimanov_6943.html" title="Mark Taimanov">Mark Taimanov</a> (USSR) and Larsen 6-0 (+6-0=0).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The latter result was particularly shocking: Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team <i>ahead</i> of Fischer just a year before, and at the Interzonal had in their game handed Fischer his only loss.</p>
<p>Only former World Champion Petrosian, Fischer's final opponent in the Candidates matches, was able to offer resistance. Petrosian unleashed a strong <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_terminology.html#T" title="Chess terminology">theoretical novelty</a> in the first game and had Fischer on the ropes, but Fischer defended with his customary aplomb and even won the game. This gave Fischer a remarkable streak of 20 consecutive wins, the second longest <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winning_streak_%28sports%29.html" title="Winning streak (sports)">winning streak</a> in chess history after <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Steinitz_fb26.html" title="Wilhelm Steinitz">Steinitz's</a> 25-game streak from 1873 to 1882.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Petrosian won decisively in the second game, finally snapping Fischer's winning streak. After three consecutive draws, however, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6.5-2.5 (+5=3-1). The final match victory allowed Fischer to challenge World Champion <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Spassky_b782.html" title="Boris Spassky">Boris Spassky</a>, whom he had never beaten before (+0=2-3).</p>

<p>Fischer's career-long stubbornness about match and tournament conditions was again seen in the run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer preferred <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, while Spassky wanted <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>. For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement fell through. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to play unless the prize fund, which he considered inadequate, was doubled. <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> financier <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Slater_5350.html" title="Jim Slater">Jim Slater</a> responded by donating an additional $US 125,000, which brought the prize fund to an unprecedented $250,000. Fischer finally agreed to play.</p>
<p>The match took place in <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reykjav%C3%ADk.html" title="Reykjavík">Reykjavík</a>, Iceland, from July through September 1972. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a dead-drawn <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html" title="Endgame">endgame</a>, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. The rest of the match proceeded without incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12.5-8.5 and become the 11th World Chess Champion. His winning strategy was mainly based upon avoidance of Spassky's pre-match preparation, by using a varied series of opening surprises. Spassky's play from games 3-10 was probably the worst in his career, as he made several bad blunders. Spassky played better in the second half of the match, but he was too far behind by that stage.</p>
<p>Fischer's win was painted as a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> victory for the United States: the iconoclastic American almost single-handedly defeating the mighty Soviet chess establishment that had dominated world chess for the past quarter-century.</p>
<p>Fischer was also the (then) highest-rated player in history according to the <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">Elo rating system</a>. He had a rating of 2780 after beating Spassky, which was actually a slight decline from the record 2785 rating he had achieved after routing Taimanov, Larsen, and Petrosian the previous year.</p>
<p>The match was coined "The Match of the Century", and received front-page media coverage in the United States. With his victory, Fischer became an instant celebrity. He received numerous product endorsement offers (all of which he declined) and appeared on the covers of <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_%28magazine%29.html" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></i>.

However, 1972 was a disastrous year for the church, as prophecies by Herbert W.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Edit section: Fischer-Karpov 1975">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fischer-Karpov 1975</span></h2>
<p>Fischer was scheduled to defend his title against challenger <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatoly_Karpov_dcca.html" title="Anatoly Karpov">Anatoly Karpov</a> in 1975. Fischer had played no tournament games since winning the title, and he laid down numerous (a total of 64) conditions for the match. While most of them were purely game-oriented in nature, some were as bizarre as a requirement for everyone entering the room where the game is conducted to take off head covering. Many commentators supposed that Fischer's objective in making the demands was to avoid conducting the match in the outcome of which Fischer was not certain. Fischer's demands as to the conduct of the match and victory conditions the following three principal demands:</p>
<p>1. The match should continue until 10 wins, without counting the draws. 2. There is no limit to the total number of games played. 3. In case of a 9:9 score, champion (Fischer) retains his title.</p>
<p>Fischer claimed the usual system (24 games with the first player to get 12.5 points winning, or the champion retaining his title in the event of a 12-12 tie) encouraged the player in the lead to draw games, which he regarded as bad for chess. Fischer instead wanted a match of an unlimited number of games. However, match based on the first two conditions could take several months (In 1927 the Capablanca-Alyohin match to achieve the condition of winning only 6 games continued for 34 games). Many argued that this would be an exercise in stamina rather than skill. The FIDE comission headed by FIDE president <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Euwe_23e0.html" title="Max Euwe">Max Euwe</a> and consisting of both, US and USSR, representatives, ruled that the match should continue until 6 wins. However, Fischer replied that he resigns his crown and would not participiate in the match. Instead of accepting Fischer's forfeit, the comission agreed to allow the match to continue until 9 wins, leaving only one of the 64 conditions set by Fischer unsatisfied. FIDE postulated that the player achieving 9 victories first would win the match, eliminating any advantage for the reigning champion (Fischer). Most observers considered Fischer's demand of his win in case of 9:9 draw to be unfair. It meant that Fischer only needed to win nine games to retain the championship, while Karpov had to win by a 10-8 score. Because FIDE would not agree to that demand, Fischer resigned in a cable to FIDE president Max Euwe on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"As I made clear in my telegram to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs me that the rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participating in the 1975 world chess championship. I therefore resign my FIDE world chess champion title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer."</i></dd>

<p>Fischer's friend and childhood mentor, former U.S. Champion <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Denker_fad2.html" title="Arnold Denker">Arnold Denker</a>, was in contact with the reclusive Fischer during the match negotiations. Denker, writing with his co-author, the respected chess journalist Larry Parr, in the book <i>The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories</i> (Hypermodern Press 1995), explained that Fischer knew he hadn't been playing for three years, and hence he wanted a long match to be able to play himself into shape.</p>
<p>Karpov, writing nearly 20 years later in his autobiography <i>Karpov on Karpov</i> (Atheneum 1991), expressed profound regret that the match did not take place. He views the cancelled match as the most disappointing episode in his own life, and stated that the lack of the opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development from what he might have achieved. Karpov, who had prepared hard for several months in anticipation, became World Champion by default in April, 1975, and went on to dominate chess in Fischer's absence for the next decade. Karpov has a high regard for Fischer's chess, and met with Fischer several times after 1975. Karpov wrote that the two champions got along well on a personal level, as they tried to reach agreement to play the match, without success.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, who succeeded Karpov as World Champion in 1985 and dominated top-flight chess for nearly 20 years, has written a five-volume series of books <i>My Great Predecessors</i> on the great champions who came before him. He writes that Karpov would have had a good chance against Fischer in 1975.</p>
<p>Fischer disappeared and did not play competitive chess for nearly 20 years. To this day, he claims that he is still the World Champion because he never lost a title match.</p>

<p>After 20 years, Fischer emerged from isolation to challenge Spassky (then placed 96-102 on the rating list) to a "Revenge Match of the 20th Century" in 1992. This match took place in <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sveti_Stefan_432e.html" title="Sveti Stefan">Sveti Stefan</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_fb6f.html" title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">FR Yugoslavia</a>, in spite of a severe <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embargo.html" title="Embargo">embargo</a> that included sanctions on <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sporting</a> events. Fischer demanded that the organizers bill the match as "The World Chess Championship", although <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> was the recognized FIDE World Champion. The purse for this match was reported to be $US 5,000,000 with two-thirds to go to the winner. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury_0ac6.html" title="United States Department of the Treasury">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> had warned Fischer beforehand that his participation was illegal.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Following the match, the department obtained an <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest_warrant.html" title="Arrest warrant">arrest warrant</a> for him although some dispute the legality of the Department's claim and question why others who broke the embargo have not been prosecuted.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Fischer won the match, 10 wins to 5, with 15 draws. Many grandmasters observing the match said that Fischer was past his prime. In the book <i>Mortal Games</i>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> is quoted: "He is playing OK. Around 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us." He has not played any competitive games since.</p>
<p>Fischer insisted he was still the true world champion, and that all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Korchnoi_6836.html" title="Victor Korchnoi">Korchnoi</a> and Kasparov, had been pre-arranged.</p>

<p>Fischer, whose mother and possible biological father <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Nemenyi_874d.html" title="Paul Nemenyi">Paul Nemenyi</a> were both of Jewish descent, made occasional hostile comments toward <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> from at least the early 1960s. From the 1980s, however, antisemitism was a major theme of his public remarks. He denied the "Holocaust of the Jews," announced his desire to make "expos[ing] the Jews for the criminals they are [...] the murderers they are" his lifework, and argued that the United States is "a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards." <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, he gave a call-in interview to a radio station in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, during which he described himself as the "victim of an international Jewish conspiracy." Fischer's sudden re-emergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings, which had been stored in a <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasadena%2C_California_0cce.html" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena, California</a> storage unit, were sold by the landlord, who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent. Fischer interpreted this as further evidence of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy perpetrated by "the Jew-controlled U.S. Government" to defame and destroy him .<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> In 2005, some of Fischer's belongings were auctioned on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>. In 2006, Fischer claimed that his belongings in the storage unit were worth millions.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fischer participated in at least 33 such broadcasts between 1999 and 2005, mostly with radio stations in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, but also with stations in Iceland, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>.</p>
<p>For some years Fischer lived in Budapest, where he lived with the Jewish <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polg%C3%A1r_sisters.html" title="Polgár sisters">Polgár</a> <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a>. He played Fischer Random Blitz as well as analyzed many games with Zsuzsa Polgar. He did not get along with her two younger sisters Judit and Zsofia after Zsofia agreed to give a simultaneous exhibition at the Budapest American club. He later lived in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Zsofia in the televised interview also claims that Fischer could get along with Jewish individuals by simply saying that they were a good person but doing anything for America was a far greater crime in his view.</p>

Fischer used a genuine passport that the United States Embassy in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bern%2C_Switzerland_68b9.html" title="Bern, Switzerland">Bern, Switzerland</a> issued to him in 1997. The passport was allegedly revoked in 2003, although Fischer asserts that it was valid.<a href="http://www.bobby-fischer.net/embassy_of_the_united_states_revoves_passport.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobby-fischer.net/embassy_of_the_united_states_revoves_passport.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Fischer has been wanted by the United States government since his 1992 match with Spassky in the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_fb6f.html" title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. The match violated President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>'s <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Order_8881.html" title="Executive Order">Executive Order</a> 12810 that implemented <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> sanctions against engaging in economic activities in <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Fischer's supporters have stated that other U.S. citizens were present at the match, specifically reporters, and were not prosecuted. They also have stated that although Japan and the United States have a mutually binding <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extradition.html" title="Extradition">extradition</a> <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty.html" title="Treaty">treaty</a>, Fischer should not have been deported, as violating a U.S. executive order is not a violation of Japanese law. Tokyo-based Canadian journalist and consultant John Bosnitch set up the "Committee to Free Bobby Fischer" after meeting Fischer at Narita airport and offering to assist him. Bosnitch was subsequently allowed to participate as a <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curiae.html" title="Amicus curiae">friend of the court</a> by an Immigration Bureau panel handling Fischer's case. He then worked to block the Japanese Immigration Bureau's efforts to deport Fischer to the United States and coordinated the legal and public relations campaign to free Fischer until his eventual release.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France-Presse_c913.html" title="Agence France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a>, Fischer renounced his <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_nationality_law_0085.html" title="United States nationality law">United States citizenship</a>. A month later, it was reported that Fischer was marrying <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyoko_Watai_b303.html" title="Miyoko Watai">Miyoko Watai</a>, the President of the Japanese Chess Association, with whom he had been living since 2000.

<p>Seeking ways to evade deportation to the United States, Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland in early January 2005 and requested an Icelandic citizenship. (Fischer also attempted, unsuccessfully, to receive <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbian</a> citizenship.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He also unsuccessfully requested <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> citizenship on the grounds that his late father, Hans Gerhardt Fischer, had been a lifelong German citizen.) Sympathetic to Fischer's plight – but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship – Icelandic authorities granted him an <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien%27s_passport.html" title="Alien's passport">alien's passport</a>. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Althing.html" title="Althing">Alþingi</a> agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the U.S. and Japanese governments <a href="http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2275" class="external autonumber" title="http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2275" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Meanwhile, the U.S. government filed charges of <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a> against Fischer in an effort to prevent him from traveling to Iceland.</p>
<p>When Japanese authorities received confirmation of Fischer's new citizenship, they agreed to release him and allow him to fly to Iceland. Although Iceland has an extradition treaty with the United States, Icelandic law does not permit its own citizens to be extradited. Icelandic officials reiterated their belief that the United States government had singled Fischer out for his political statements.</p>
<p>Shortly before his departure to Iceland on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Fischer and Bosnitch appeared briefly on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_Service_bff7.html" title="BBC World Service">BBC World Service</a>, via a telephone link to the Tokyo airport. Bosnitch stated that Fischer would never play traditional chess again. Fischer denounced President Bush as a criminal and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> as a <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_state.html" title="Puppet state">puppet</a> of the United States. He also stated that he would appeal his case to the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> and said that he would not return to the US while Bush was in power. Upon his arrival in <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reykjav%C3%ADk.html" title="Reykjavík">Reykjavík</a>, Fischer was welcomed by a crowd.</p>
<p>In May 2005, a delegation, including Boris Spassky, visited Iceland with the intent of "drawing Fischer back to the chessboard." Fischer appeared interested in playing a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess960.html" title="Chess960">Chess960</a> match against a "worthy opponent." Spassky said that he was not planning to play Fischer. <a href="http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2414" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2414" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>On Dec. 10, 2006, Fischer phoned in and pointed out a clever winning combination which was missed in a chess game which was televised in Iceland.<a href="http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3546" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3546" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Fischer was renowned for his opening preparation, and made numerous contributions to chess opening theory. He was considered the greatest practitioner of the White side of the Closed <a href="../../../r/u/y/Ruy_Lopez_6f76.html" title="Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> and the Black side of the <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_Defence%2C_Najdorf_Variation_50eb.html" title="Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation">Najdorf Sicilian</a>, as well as being one of the greatest theoreticians of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Indian_Defense_53a8.html" title="King's Indian Defense">King's Indian Defense</a>. He also demonstrated several important improvements in the <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunfeld_Defence_bfa0.html" title="Grunfeld Defence">Grunfeld Defence</a>. In the <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimzo-Indian_Defence_4ffb.html" title="Nimzo-Indian Defence">Nimzo-Indian Defence</a>, the line beginning with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 is named for him.</p>
<p>Fischer established the viability of the so-called "Poisoned Pawn" variation of the <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_Defence%2C_Najdorf_Variation_50eb.html" title="Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation">Najdorf Sicilian</a> (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6!?). Although this bold queen sortie, snatching a pawn at the expense of development, had been considered dubious, Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness, a claim supported by contemporary theory. Fischer won many games with this line; his only loss was in the 11th game of his 1972 match with Spassky.</p>
<p>In 1960, prompted by a painful loss to Spassky, Fischer wrote an article entitled "A Bust to the King's Gambit" for the first issue of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Evans_284b.html" title="Larry Evans">Larry Evans</a>' <i>American Chess Quarterly</i>, in which he recommended 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 d6. This variation has since become known as the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fischer_Defense_a963.html" title="Fischer Defense">Fischer Defense</a> to the King's Gambit. After Fischer's article was published, the opening was seen even less frequently in master-level games, although Fischer took up the White side of it in three games (preferring 3.Bc4 to 3.Nf3), winning them all.</p>
<p>Fischer revived the Exchange Variation of the <a href="../../../r/u/y/Ruy_Lopez_6f76.html" title="Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> at the <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a> Olympiad 1966 (specifically the line beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0-0), and had great success with it, prompting many other top players to start playing it.</p>
