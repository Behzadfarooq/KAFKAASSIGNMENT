<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Braham_8c7f.html" title="Edit section: War career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">War career</span></h2>
<p>His first squadron was No 29 Squadron RAF in December 1938, flying the two-seater <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Demon_c6a3.html" title="Hawker Demon">Hawker Demon</a>. Early in 1939, No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Blenheim_b757.html" title="Bristol Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a>, but soon after switched to the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>. Braham carried out his first operational patrols of World War II in September 1939. He had by now been given the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career.</p>
<p>No 29 Squadron was now designated a night-fighter squadron and once again received Blenheim l's. In mid 1940, they were being equipped with the early AI Mk III RDF 'radar' and four Browning machine guns in a pack under the belly. The squadron started night flights over <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> in June 1940. On the night of 24/<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a> 1940, during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, Bob destroyed his first enemy aircraft, a <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinkel_He-111_301d.html" title="Heinkel He-111">Heinkel He-111</a> of III/KG55, guided by his AI operator A/C Jacobson.</p>
<p>In October 1940, the squadron started to receive the more modern <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Beaufighter_df50.html" title="Bristol Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> Mk IFs with Mk IV AI radar.</p>
<p>Braham received a DFC in January 1941. In March he destroyed another enemy aircraft, a Dornier 17Z of Stab/KG2, his first in a Beaufighter. No 29 Squadron moved to <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_West_Malling_a791.html" title="RAF West Malling">RAF West Malling</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a> in May 1941 and it was from here that Braham really developed his night fighting skills, with the start of his association with two Navigators/Radar Operators who would contribute so much to his success: 'Sticks' Gregory and 'Jacko' Jacobs.</p>
<p>By November of 1941, he had claimed 7 enemy aircraft, and was a <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Lieutenant_db7d.html" title="Flight Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a>, receiving a bar to his DFC. In January 1942, Braham finished his tour of operations and was posted from No 29 Squadron to No 51 OTU at <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranfield.html" title="Cranfield">Cranfield</a> as an instructor with his Navigator/AI operator F/Sgt 'Sticks' Gregory.</p>
<p>While at Cranfield, Braham and Gregory visited 29 Squadron at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Malling_4f97.html" title="West Malling">West Malling</a> and, operating on the night of the 6/<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">7 June</a> 1942 in a borrowed Beaufighter, destroyed a <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dornier_217.html" title="Dornier 217">Dornier 217</a> raiding <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury.html" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. He was posted back to No 29 Squadron from 51 OTU in July 1942 as a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Leader_315c.html" title="Squadron Leader">Squadron Leader</a> and Flight Commander. After damaging a <a href="../../../j/u/_/Ju_88.html" title="Ju 88">Ju 88</a> on the 24th, he destroyed another on the 28th. On the 29th he attacked and damaged a Ju 88 flying at 150 ft above the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>. Return fire from the Ju 88 caused his port engine to catch fire, forcing a crash landing near Beachy Head. Neither he nor Jacobs were injured. He was awarded his first DSO in October 1942.</p>
<p>By this time, Bob Braham had destroyed 12 enemy aircraft, with 1 probable and 4 damaged. He was then given command of No. 141 Squadron RAF at Ford in late 1942 as a 22 year-old Wing Commander. With him went his AI operator F/O Gregory DFC DFM.</p>
<p>No 141 Squadron's Beaufighter IF's moved to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> in February 1943 to carry out night patrols over <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> and SW France and daylight patrols over the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Biscay_07e4.html" title="Bay of Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> and Atlantic Approaches to protect <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coastal_Command_3333.html" title="Coastal Command">Coastal Command</a> aircraft.</p>

<p>In May 1943, No 141 Squadron moved to <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Wittering_088c.html" title="RAF Wittering">RAF Wittering</a>. It had been chosen to be the first night fighter squadron to operate over Germany and occupied Europe in the bomber support role. Their Beaufighters were equipped with a new homer/receiver, called <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serrate.html" title="Serrate">Serrate</a>, which picked up the radar impulses given out by the German night fighters' AI radar. The Beaufighters were also equipped with Mk IV radar.</p>
<p>Serrate operations started in June 1943. Braham had immediate success, destroying an <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messerschmitt_Bf_110_b5db.html" title="Messerschmitt Bf 110">Me-110</a> over Holland. When Braham left No 141 Squadron in October 1943, the squadron had destroyed 14 enemy aircraft using Serrate. His own score on Serrate ops was 7 destroyed, bringing his total to 20. Several of the Luftwaffe pilots he shot down were experienced 'aces', with numerous kills to their credit; 4. NJG1 lost both Fw. Krafft (15 claims) killed and Fw. Vinke (53 claims) bailed out (his crew was killed) on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a>. Hpt. August Geiger (IV/NJG1;53 claims) was shot down and drowned on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a>. Braham was awarded the first bar to his DSO on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>.</p>

<p>Against his wishes, W/C Braham was rested from operations and posted from No 141 Squadron on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>. He took a staff course at the Staff College, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberley.html" title="Camberley">Camberley</a> from October 1943 until February 1944. He was then posted as 'Wing Commander Night Operations ' at HQ <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._2_Group_RAF_a37e.html" title="No. 2 Group RAF">No. 2 Group RAF</a>. Although a Staff Officer at HQ, Braham was able, with persistence, to persuade his AOC, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Vice_Marshal_253a.html" title="Air Vice Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Embry_d1dd.html" title="Basil Embry">Basil Embry</a> to allow him to 'free-lance' using a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Mosquito_3a93.html" title="De Havilland Mosquito">Mosquito FBVI</a> loaned from one of the various squadrons in the group. His last operation of the war was a lone daylight Ranger operation over Denmark and north Germany on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">25 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Attacked by two <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focke-Wulf_190_540b.html" title="Focke-Wulf 190">FW-l90</a>'s of <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 1 over <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, he managed to crash land his crippled plane on a sandstrip by the coast and was captured. By the time he was shot down, he had carried out 15 'Ranger' operations over France, Denmark and Germany, during which he destroyed another 9 enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>In July 1945, W/C Braham joined the Night Fighter Development Wing of the Central Fighter Establishment where he tested and developed existing and new night fighting equipment. There followed a period of two years of non-flying appointments, with HQ Technical Training Command, OC No 2 Wing, No 3 Recruits Centre Padgate and the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Ministry_f2ea.html" title="Air Ministry">Air Ministry</a> in London. In August 1948, he was posted to command the Fighter Interception Development Squadron and Night Fighter Leader School of the Central Fighter Establishment .</p>
<p>In May 1952, he resigned from the RAF for the second time. He joined the <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCAF_b14e.html" title="RCAF">RCAF</a> with the rank of Wing Commander. Braham left No 3 AW(F)OTU in June 1955 for a staff appointment at Air Force HQ in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, which he held for over two years.</p>
<p>He resigned from the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force_3f81.html" title="Royal Canadian Air Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> in January 1968.</p>
