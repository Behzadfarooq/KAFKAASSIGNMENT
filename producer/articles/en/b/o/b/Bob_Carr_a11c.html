<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Carr_a11c.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>The son of a train driver, Carr was born in the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maroubra%2C_New_South_Wales_2f00.html" title="Maroubra, New South Wales">Maroubra</a>, and was educated at Matraville High School and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_South_Wales_02d5.html" title="University of New South Wales">University of New South Wales</a>, from which he graduated as a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</a> with honours in history. He is an intellectual and writer; in a recent example of his recognition as a writer, he appeared on stage at the 2004 <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Festival_3baf.html" title="Sydney Festival">Sydney Festival</a> in conversation with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Stoppard_8156.html" title="Tom Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>.</p>
<p>Before entering politics, Carr was a <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a> for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> Radio's <i>AM</i> current affairs program, wrote for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bulletin_f57c.html" title="The Bulletin">The Bulletin</a></i> and spent a period working for the Labor Council of NSW.</p>
<p>A member of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, Carr entered the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Assembly_3aa3.html" title="New South Wales Legislative Assembly">New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a> at a <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a> as the member for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maroubra.html" title="Maroubra">Maroubra</a> in October 1983.</p>
<p>In December 1984 he was appointed Minister for Planning and the Environment in the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Wran_d32c.html" title="Neville Wran">Neville Wran</a> government. He held this position until March 1988, when the ALP lost government. In February 1986 he also took on the consumer affairs portfolio, which he held until he became Minister for Heritage in July 1986.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Carr_a11c.html" title="Edit section: Leader of the Opposition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leader of the Opposition</span></h2>
<p>Carr's long-term ambition was to enter federal politics and be Minister for Foreign Affairs in a federal Labor government. But following the defeat of the New South Wales Labor government, Carr was pressured by the party organisation and his own Right faction to stand for the leadership. Carr reluctantly agreed, and became Leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p>His diary entries from the time reveal "I spent today like a doomed man, taking phone calls and drafting a statement, still saying to the press I wasn't shifting. I feel a jolt in my stomach about what I'm getting myself in for. I will destroy my career in four years. Everything's altered. It's my fate … So, for better or for worse, I become leader of the party next week."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this reluctance, Carr's performance as opposition leader gained wide approval in the party and NSW Labor only narrowly lost a tight election to <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Greiner_9a29.html" title="Nick Greiner">Nick Greiner</a>'s coalition government in 1991, despite the fact that no one expected Labor to come close to victory.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Carr_a11c.html" title="Edit section: Premier of New South Wales">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Premier of New South Wales</span></h2>
<p>In 1995 he became Premier at another close election and won comfortably again in 1999 and 2003.</p>
<p>His centrist, cautious government has been characterised by conservative financial management and the encouragement of market forces, and latterly pursued a "<a href="../../../t/o/u/Tough_on_crime.html" title="Tough on crime">tough on crime</a>" policy. Carr occasionally ventured into national policy issues, particularly issues concerning the environment and population growth. A keen bushwalker, he created numerous national parks in NSW over his decade-long term as Premier.</p>
<p>A year after his appointment as Premier, Carr caused controversy when he recommended that the newly appointed <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governors_of_New_South_Wales_9014.html" title="Governors of New South Wales">New South Wales Governor</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Samuels_ee81.html" title="Gordon Samuels">Gordon Samuels</a>, not live at <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_House%2C_Sydney_d4fa.html" title="Government House, Sydney">Government House</a>, which would become a museum open to the public; the Governor would instead "work from home" as essentially a part-time Governor.<sup id="_ref-Hans_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hans" title="">[2]</a></sup> This decision was seen by monarchists as an attempt by Carr, a republican, to downgrade the importance of the office of Governor; to substantiate this they claimed that during the announcement of the move Carr stated: "That's one for <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lang_%28Australian_politician%29_e5a8.html" title="Jack Lang (Australian politician)">Jack Lang</a>"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> - a former Premier who was <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lang_%28Australian_politician%29_e5a8.html#The_crisis_of_1931-32" title="Jack Lang (Australian politician)">dismissed by the Governor for acting illegally</a>. However, when Samuels ended his tenure as Governor, Carr praised him for his work, and it was mentioned that Samuels had no issue with abandoning Government House.<sup id="_ref-Hans_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hans" title="">[2]</a></sup> The cost savings, stated to be over $2 million a year, never materialized; the Auditor General reported that costs to maintain the house and the office of the Governor had actually increased by $600,000. Initially it was also suggested that Samuels would retain his various chairmanships and committee memberships while serving as Governor, but after protests from some sections of the media this suggestion was dropped.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Carr faced criticism due to his alleged involvement in the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Grove_affair_11de.html" title="Orange Grove affair">Orange Grove affair</a>, and also from the Commissioner of the NSW <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption_of_New_South_Wales_9a8f.html" title="Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales">Independent Commission Against Corruption</a>, due to his remarks that a minister under investigation by the ICAC would be "vindicated" before the release of that body's findings on the matter; this resulted in an allegation of contempt, which was subsequently dropped.</p>
<p>After 10 years as Premier, Carr announced his resignation both as Premier and as the member for Maroubra on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_27.html" title="July 27">27 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to be effective from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">3 August</a>. This immediately prompted speculation that the resignation was a prelude to a move into federal politics, but Carr denied this. His successor as Premier is former health minister <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_Iemma_5dac.html" title="Morris Iemma">Morris Iemma</a>. Carr's resignation triggered further resignations, namely those of Deputy Premier <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Refshauge_4d94.html" title="Andrew Refshauge">Andrew Refshauge</a> and Planning Minister <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Knowles_83e0.html" title="Craig Knowles">Craig Knowles</a>.</p>
<p>Carr has opposed <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_republicanism.html" title="Australian republicanism">Australian republicanism</a> if it entailed public election of the President (he supported a President appointed by Parliament). He also opposed a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_Rights_7ef3.html" title="Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a>, claiming it would merely lead to increased litigation.</p>

<p>In May 2003, a biography by Marilyn Dodkin, <i>Bob Carr: the reluctant leader</i>, was published, partly because it was based on Carr's private diaries and included his often uncomplimentary thoughts on various political personalities. A second biography, <i>Bob Carr—a self-made man</i>, by Andrew West and Rachel Morris, was published in September 2003 by Harper Collins.</p>
