<p>I've started to add to wiki's page on my great-grandfather at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Edward_Guinness%2C_1st_Baron_Moyne#_ref-32" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Edward_Guinness%2C_1st_Baron_Moyne#_ref-32" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Edward_Guinness%2C_1st_Baron_Moyne#_ref-32</a> He was an over-achiever who was sadly killed by Jewish terrorists in 1944. I don't mind that, but in adding a lot of references about his earlier life the discussion page has got nasty, as in:</p>
<p>"ridicilous POV based on a minority of historians, perhaps only one</p>
<p>it now looks like a tribute to Moyne the martyr, even though his personal responsiblity in the fate of the hungarian jews and other european refugees is fully documented. this was the main reason for the assassination. Amoruso 20:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tried to attempt to bring back the whole sections being deleted for no reasons without reverting to the old version. It may require complete clean up. Amoruso 20:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>It seems to me that the page has been used for arguments about anti-semite this and that. I don't mind that, but feel that my great-grandfather's earlier life also deserves to be told.</p>
<p>I don't think it needs arbitration - yet - but when I have reff'ed everything over a day, I am alarmed to see that someone says "It may require complete clean up." The page belongs to all serious published references, surely? I don't mind in the least if people mention his death and the last two years of his life, but I feel the first 62 years deserve serious mention as well.</p>
<p>Plus I am new to wikipedia editing...thanks in advance. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiman_a8c7.html" title="User:Wikiman">Wikiman</a> 21:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dont know if this is a dispute as such but just the other day [Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog] ended up deleted under copyvio. Citing the reason as infomation taken from a website. Wiki claims that copyright doesnt cover text from public domain so surely this means it's not a copyvio? In any case the notice now on the page says after a week it gets deleted&#160;:\. Could you help us save the page, it had so much work done on it that it would be a shame to see all that hard work going to waste <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJennytablina_a089.html" title="User:Jennytablina">Jennytablina</a> 22:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Can you please help me. I received a bizarre message from an unknown source on Wikipedia stating that I am believed to be someone else. To the best of my knowledge I am the same person I have always been.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly what this means as I have only been using wikipedia for several weeks but whoever sent the message deleted my edits, which I believe are responsible edits (<a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Mercer_a955.html" title="Patrick Mercer">Patrick Mercer</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_Research_Unit_167a.html" title="Force Research Unit">Force Research Unit</a>).

<p>Dear Bob:</p>
<p>The same Wikipedian who accused me of being a sockpuppet previously is doing it again. You told me to contact you if anyone reposts the same message which has again happened and this individual has deleted all my edits from today. He seems to be pursuing some sort of vendetta against another Wikipedian and I am caught in the crosshairs. Is this acceptable behavior and shouldn't he or she be penalized for this?</p>
<p>See below from my edits to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_Worsthorne_a8d6.html" title="Peregrine Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a>'s page:</p>

<p>Dear Bob: Is this person whoever he or she may be permitted to engage in this type of behavior beased on alleged suspicions. How come he or she has never contacted me instead of pre-emptively deleting my edits and forcing me to do them over once you have given me the all clear. This cannot go on indefinitely as I refuse to re do all my work every night because of this individual. My edits should be judged on their merits. And this person needs to be warned that if he or she continues he or she will be blocked. Why do I have to endure this behavior when you have already adjudged in my favor in this ongoing situation?</p>
<p>I hope this will be the last time I have to contact you.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Andrew (sorry I called you Bob previously):</p>
<p>I think I understand now why this is happening. Apparently "Demiurge" resents my having updated something he/she had previously edited, although my edits were not very different from his. I checked out his/her home page briefly and apparently we are both Irish, so we have some shared interests, although mine are more contemporary.</p>
<p>I think he/she should have contacted me rather than behaving as he or she did. As far as other points he mentioned on Bottesini's page in response to my complaint (he seems to be stalking me on Wikipedia): in re <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>, I am extremely interested in the subject, having lost a grandmother to the disease and I am very gratfeul that list exists and I plan to add more names to it as the opportunities (unfortunately) arise. Am I the only one interested in this subject?</p>
<p>I am interested in entertainment and politics (as Demiurge accuses me) just as it says on my home page but <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_McCargo_9975.html" title="Brian McCargo">Brian McCargo</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Towneley_a054.html" title="Simon Towneley">Simon Towneley</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellyanne_Conway_4cd9.html" title="Kellyanne Conway">Kellyanne Conway</a> are hardly "minor Hollywood celebrities."</p>
<p>Please help with this nonsense so it is not a recurring issue every night.</p>

<p>The name of the article is Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation. In order to understand what is going one, someone needs to read my first edit to the article, and Lethe's reaction to my first edit, and his totally dismissive comments on the talk page. He insists that everything I write is patently wrong, even though I have ample support for every one of my contentions. As a matter of fact, there is no dispute among physicists about any of the changes I want to make to the article, that is what makes this so frustrating.</p>
<p>I see much more of what I originally put in the article has been put back after Lethe revereted all of it. The problem is if I add something, Lethe reverts it. If someone else adds the exact same thing, he doesn't. My problem is with Lethe. Lethe says everything I write is patently wrong, even though I provide ample support each of my claims on the articles talk page. Lethe claimed my assertions were so wrong, he could revert them all without bothering to address any of them.</p>
<p>Lethe claimed the word "paradox" and "constradiction" always mean the exact same thing. Instead of editing my additions or modifying them, he always reverts everything I add.</p>
<p>I think it is better to list each point separate instead of lumping them all together. Michael Price says if a person disagrees with one advantage, that weakens the whole theory so it is better to lump all advantages together under a few points. I disagree. If you lump many points together, and someone disagrees with one aspect of one point, many advantages they agree with are lost, as you've lumped many advantages they agree with together with one they don't. If any part of a point is wrong, the whole point is lost. Hence, it is better to list each advantage separately.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no dispute among physicists about the truth of any of the advantages I listed. I have ample support for each and every point. Everything I wrote is important to the article. I would like to hear one objective party tell me that is not the case. I am ready to support each and every contention I've made. CSTAR who initially objected to my list was satisfied with it after he modified it.</p>
<p>I want to find one objective person interested in the subject tell me that what I wish to add does not improve the article. I provided important, highly relevant quotes by Einstein, David Deutsch, and Richard Feynman that have all been stripped from the article. Anyone should be able to see the difference between what I want to add and what is there now.</p>

<p>Lethe violates all these Wikipedia rules. Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>
<p>To assume good faith is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia. As we allow anyone to edit, it follows that we assume that most people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it. If this weren't true, a project like Wikipedia would be doomed from the beginning.</p>
<p>So, when you can reasonably assume that something is a well-intentioned error, correct it without just reverting it or labeling it as vandalism.</p>
<p>Especially, remember to be patient with newcomers, who will be unfamiliar with Wikipedia's culture and rules. Correcting a newly added sentence that you know to be wrong is also much better than simply deleting it.</p>
<p>You should not act like their mistake was deliberate. Correct, but don't scold.</p>
<p>Avoidance The best way to resolve a dispute is to avoid it in the first place.</p>
<p>Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: Do not simply revert changes in a dispute. When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, improve the edit, rather than reverting it. Provide a good edit summary when making significant changes that other users might object to.</p>

<p>Hi Bobcheezy,</p>
<p>Nagel just wrote in the article's discussion page that my addition is excellent and should be added to the article, not two seconds later Lethe was all over my new addition, nitpicking like crazy. Lest you think Nagel and I are the same person, a quick review of the discussion page will make clear that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Please look at Lethe's reaction to my first Wikipedia edit, and how he reverts every word I try to add. If others add the exact same thing I do, he leaves their edits alone.</p>
<p>He reverted my first addition saying everything I wrote was patently false, and he could revert it without commentary because not one thing I said was correct. Please read the article's discussion pages from the time of my first edit.</p>
<p>After other editors modify my additions, he continously reverts everything.</p>

<p>Lethe refers to me "the lamentable Michael D. Wolok." I think this is uncivil and an insult.</p>
<p>The only article I am working on now is "Many Worlds," and the only editor I have a problem with is Lethe. Others may disagree with my additions, but they are reasonable. Lethe from the beginning has only wanted everyone to dismiss everything I have to add. He is the one who reverts every word I add, and every change I make.</p>

<p>Hi there, I am currently having a dispute with a moderator of the word Mulatto. His name is JereKrischel and I believe he/she is being extremely biased. I'd like you to follow along, if posssible. Because I will show you thing's that just don't make sense.</p>

<dd>Hey bobcheezy - just to let you know, I've got no dog in this fight...this is strictly a linkspam issue. User:131.247.234.199 started linkspamming explicitlymixed.com a few months ago. It looks like a new online magazine, attempting to drive traffic...it's pretty much completely broken when viewed in Firefox, but the linkspamming started when it was going public.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since the initial linkspamming, other alias (possible sockpuppets), have tried to add things back in, like <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberalpunt_7816.html" title="User:Liberalpunt">User:Liberalpunt</a>, and now User:Aries90. AFAIK, the commerical links Aries90 has been removing are established yahoo discussion groups, so they get to stay, but trying to drive traffic to a new online magazine is clearly not appropriate. If you have any other questions, please leave me a message on my <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJereKrischel_5089.html" title="User talk:JereKrischel">talk page</a>. Thanks! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 03:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Andrew, no Explicitly Mixed isn't an online magazine. Jereschel: Seems? Seems like an online magazine? Where did you get that? Explicitly Mixed is not a online magazine. If that is the case I could say the same thing about a non-yahoo webpage like mulatto.org. Please re-assess this, this is absolutely non-sensical. How can explicitly mixed not be added as a resource while another website whereby the same assumptions can be made on another website such as mulatto.org? The page posted is a MULATTO page. Simple enough. Jereschel you are being unfair in ASSUMING Explicitly Mixed is an online magazine. Why not assume the same with the "non-yahoo" webpage's. You Assume? A moderator on wikipedia ASSUME instead of getting the facts?</p>

<p>Jereschel nor you bobcheezy has given me a good reason for anything. You only ASSUME it's a online magazine without even contacting the site. Wow, he even removed the link under the word Multiracial. I take it he really hate's Explicitly Mixed. I think I know where this is heading. Thank you for your time gentlemen.</p>

Kudos to the editors who helped obtain these achievements!
<p>WikiProject Star Wars is also on a mission to improve Star Wars articles using the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>An out of universe perspective versus an in universe perspective (see <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWriting_about_fiction_921f.html" title="Wikipedia:Writing about fiction">Wikipedia:Writing about fiction</a> and the future ammendments to our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Star_Wars_Manual_of_style_f483.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Wars/Manual of style">manual of style</a>)</li>
<li>Evolving lists into regular articles</li>
<li>Moving excess information and specifics to <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a> (and providing links to Wookieepedia per the "see also" and/or "external links" sections)</li>
<li>Enhanced communication amongst WikiProject members</li>
<li>More to come</li>
</ul>
<p>These should provide the basic steps needed to improve and "encyclopedia-fy" the Star Wars series of articles.</p>

<p>As many of you know, lists of minor Star Wars-related themes are very common on Wikipedia; however, since these may be seen as violations of Wikipedia policy (and having seperate articles would breach <i>even more</i> policies), the tentative solution is to create general articles on a list's topic (for example, turning List of Star Wars devices into Technology of Star Wars, which allows us to cover everything from hyperspace to comlinks in a general encyclopedic fashion). This can be very tough for some broad topics, so the key is <i>organization</i>. I encourage all editors to list their ideas on the WikiProject talk page. It will be a very difficult — but tangible — effort.</p>
<p>For an example, let me point you to the Final Fantasy WikiProject. Some of us over at that WikiProject decided to turn various components of <i>Final Fantasy X</i>, such as <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyreflies.html" title="Pyreflies">Pyreflies</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevon.html" title="Yevon">Yevon</a>, and the backstory — into an article <i>describing</i> the world of Spira. Location descriptions were given a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_locations_in_Spira_e311.html" title="List of locations in Spira">List of locations in Spira</a> article, and the details themselves were placed on the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Spira (Final Fantasy X)</a> page. This is a decent template to follow — however, we will need to place priority on out-of-universe, "real life" topics and perspectives in realtion to the article.</p>
<p>Sounds confusing, eh? It won't, for examples will be popping up left and right in the near future!</p>
