<p>I have reverted your removal of date wikilinks. I felt that you should know - could I also ask what you meant by "reduce low added value links"? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:53, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the same question. Why are you removing wikilinks for dates? I recall some discussion on whether dates should be wikilinked and the consensus being afirmative, but that was some 18 or so months ago, IIRC. If there has been a change in reccomended style that I've missed, could you please give me a pointer to it? If this is just your own personal decision that date wikilinks should be removed, could you please hold off until there has been some discussion on the question?

<dd>Thanks for mentioning it. I meant that the articles such as <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> are of little value to the reader. Linking to them many times makes the individual value even lower. The reason why some dates are within brackets is mainly so that date preferences work. Thus <i>3 September 1980</i> will be converted into <i>September 3, 1980</i>. It is not really a 'link' at all. The link function is merely an additional part of the implementation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dates that are not subject to regional variation (such as year only) do not have preferences. So the issue is not about <b>dates</b>, the issue is about <b>dates subject to preferences</b> and <b>dates not subject to preferences</b>. A year only should be treated just like any other term in the article like <i>burglary</i>. This issue is mentioned in the Manual of Style.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know that some people link all instances of year only. I don't really know why. I hope that I have made you think about this issue. This issue is mentioned in the Manual of Style. But if you think links to the year articles are important, then that is fine by me. Be bold with your edits and put the article back how you like it. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 03:32, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>A good question. The explanation might be easier when we consider the question <i>Why link dates?</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for the existence of date 'links' is because of 'date preferences'. For example, Americans like to see April 12, 1981 and Brits like to see 12 April 1981. If square brackets are added, the Wikipedia software amends the format so that the sequence matches that chosen by the reader in the preference settings. It should not really be called a 'link' at all, the actual 'link' to the article is merely a secondary effect.
<p>Date elements that are unambiguous across cultures (such as a year on its own: <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>) do not involve date preferences and so do not need the square brackets for reformatting. It is explained (not very well) at: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Date_formatting" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Date_formatting</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Internal_links" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)#Internal_links</a></p>
<p>This issue is widely misunderstood. Lots of dates get linked on Wikipedia and some people think that means *all* must be linked. However, this is not supported in any Wikipedia guidance. There is no assertion that reader access to date articles is insufficiently satisfied.</p>
<p>I think linking of solitary-years and solitary-months is overlinking. However if that is what people want, it is fine by me but I think it has just become one of the things that editors do without thinking too much.</p>
<p>The issue is discussed from time to time. For example at: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Dates_linking_convention_currently_ludicrous" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Dates_linking_convention_currently_ludicrous</a>.</p>

<dd>It's also not true that none of the years standing alone should be linked. I have pointed out that dates are overlinked; I do not, however, agree that they should never be linked if it has nothing to do with preferences.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In your overzealous "reducing overlinking" you have now gone so far as to remove a link that was the only year mentioned in a whole article, and one that could legitimately be linked for purposes other than preferences, and were reverted on it by someone other than me. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:24, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. Overlinking of dates is one of the most common silly things on Wikipedia. Hopefully, more editors will start to realise that. The real solution is to find a better method of handling date formats. There is a proposal to handle this but it needs to go on bugzilla. If you can help put it there, I would be grateful.

<p>I agree that we don't need to link individual months in articles, but to go through and delink years is not a well spent effort, if you ask me. Being able to reference the year article from individual articles is an important source of historical context for events. It's nice to immediately see what else was happening in the year that penicillin was invented, or when the Corvette was redesigned, or when Pete Rose was first accused of betting on baseball. If a year is important enough to mention in an article, it's important enough to link it's first use in the article. Although I don't mind unlinking second and later mentions of a year, please don't unlink first mention of individual years in each article.

<dd>You made a reasonable debating point about <i>significant</i> years. I don't agree that this is a sufficient reason, but it seems a reasonable point.

<p>I unlink months in almost any circumstance. Years I leave at the moment - because I forsee the ability to display Jewish/Moslem years etc. I'd like to see an alternative wikifying for dates, e.g. &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;. (Automatic recognition is fraught with peril, and the grief I've had over it is huge, in fact it's one reason I don't welcome the orange "You have new messasages" rectangle like I used to.) A good markup interpreter would deal with some of the thinks like "2nd to 3rd June 1999". This would leave links for things like <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentines_Day_f1f0.html" title="Valentines Day">Valentines Day</a>. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 17:13, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Glad to read that you unlink months. I had not thought about non-Christian calendars. That is an interesting point. I also find the <i>You have new messages</i> rectangle too dominant. In fact, a lot of the editor-centric templates are too dominant in my opinion. We should be much more subtle and make a better experience for the core function of reading the articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am also not a big fan of automation as a solution to all problems. Some people suggest that articles could be converted into metric units automatically. Even more ambitious people suggest that user preferences could control the display of metric or non-metric units. I think the cure in that case is worse than the disease.</dd>

<dd>Your suggestion of an alternative mark up for date preferences sounds good to me. I think it has even been mentioned before.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I notice that you have recently edited several of my contributions with the comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Units. Reduce linking to solitary years and solitary months in accordance with Manual of Style.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The actual changes seems to be changing an area in hectares to the equivalent in square kilometers, and delinking a year that is not previously linked in the article. I'm mystified as to why either of these improves the article, but as I'm in the process of writing more articles along the same lines, I thought I'd better ask you to explain. And could you give me a more specific reference to the bit of the MoS you are quoting. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 15:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for bringing this here. The unit change is because it is easier for ordinary people to visualise areas in square kilometres than hectares.

<dd>You can add what you like to the edit summary by changing the "summary" box, or choose one of the pre-set ones, I have changed the append thing so it can only work on talk pages now, but you would have seen it on the diff. General fixed does "see also" and "external links" mistakes and removes excess whitespace and a couple of other minor things, hopefully I'll add more to this soon. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another point. The 'What links here' includes user pages, wikipedia pages, talk pages etc. That is all 'as it says on the tin', but I nearly failed to spot some of those and just caught it before it edited them. Would it be possible to suppress editing of such pages? And what do 'Auto tag' and 'Regex' do? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 23:39, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Auto tag adds wikify and stub tags when appropriate, regex enables <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_expression.html" title="Regular expression">regular expression</a> find and replace. I am working on filtering out non-mainspace articles, but you can sort them alphabetically then remove other name spaces pretty easily.

<dd>I used to put the relevant section of the Manual of Style but the edits are now now being considered as a good task for a bot. So the primary debate is now taking place at 'talk:Bots'.

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>I noticed this morning that you dewikilinked all the years in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">Beer</a>. Looking over your talk page, I see that this is a matter of some importance for you. Allow me to suggest that "AWB Assisted cleanup" is a wholly misleading edit summary to use when de-linking every linked year within an article, to say nothing of flagging such an edit as "minor". It smacks of trying to sweep such changes (which can be extensive in an article the size of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">Beer</a>) under the rug in hopes that no one will notice.</p>
<p>All the best.<br />

<dd>Hi, the edit summary is certainly not intended to be misleading. I think it qualifies as minor because I am not changing anything that the article says. I am not trying to sweep changes under the rug, au contraire, if you look at my contributions in talk pages, you will see that I am not only open, I am active in the community in discussing how I think Wikipedia can be improved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I used to be very specific and if you go back far enough in my edits you will see that. I became less specific as I included many other little details. Your desire for a specific summary for specific action is entirely reasonable so I will act on your comment. I will use a more focussed edit summary in future. Thanks for raising it here and please join in the various debates.

<p>Hi, I have blocked this account for 3 hours. You are making edits far too fast to a) be healthy for the servers and b) to check each one individually, and since you don't have approval for the bot I am blocking you.</p>
<p>I would also note that I consider it rather impolite of you to continue to run the bot when you know full well that there is a large discussion about the appropriateness of removing links around dates. Please wait until the community has formed a consensus on what to do before running this bot again. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 20:30, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! When you're delinking years (a guideline I hadn't realized existed, incidentally; thanks for educating me&#160;;-)), if it's not too much trouble, could you check that the second date in a pair remains shortened. In other words, <a href="../../../1/5/0/1508.html" title="1508">1508</a>-<a href="../../../1/5/1/1516.html" title="1516">16</a> should become 1508-16, not 1508-1516. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:17, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your thanks. Since the fuss about the millenium bug, I assumed that years should always be 4 digits.

<p>Your recent edit to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> has alerted to the existence of your wonderful bot and the related debates and vote.

<p>Hello. I noticed that you made an edit on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cris_Morena_af58.html" title="Cris Morena">Cris Morena</a> when the page still had the Inuse marker. That cost me a lot of extra work. Next time you see the Inuse marker, you need to respect that sign, and wait until it is taken off to make an edit.</p>

<p>I don't have any strong feelings one way or the other about wikifying years, but I noticed on <a href="../../../f/u/j/Fujitani_Ayako_894b.html" title="Fujitani Ayako">Fujitani Ayako</a> that the not-yet-a-bot took ([[1995]]-[[1999]]) and made it to (1995-[[1999]]), leaving the wikilink on 1999.

<dd>Thanks for the feedback. It is not a bug. It is a feature.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I avoid years in full dates such as [[March 29]],[[1984]] (from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>. The current regex will not match a year link if it has a preceding link. That is why it matched the first of the pair but not the second. It would delink the other if it looked at the article again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you suggest, a more sophisticated regex could be comprehensive in one pass. I am making detailed improvements to the regex over time. If bot permission is granted, I will seek advice on the best regex.

<p>I have added a date link reducing option for you (removes year, month, day and date links), it can be downloaded <a href="http://www.velocitymanager.com/Martin/AutoWikiBrowserBobblewik.zip" class="external text" title="http://www.velocitymanager.com/Martin/AutoWikiBrowserBobblewik.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I tested your new version but I see that it also delinks full dates that are valid for date preferences. I don't think I would be brave enough to go that far. I do not delink full dates that are valid for date preferences. This is because consent for limited scope is easier to obtain.</dd>

<li>Any decade:
<ul>
<li>([0-9]{4}s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any three digit or four digit year but not when preceded by a month/day combination or when followed by an ISO8601 month/day combination. My test has been rather crude (it does not watch for ISO dates yet). I merely look for *any* preceding link: ([^\]]{4})\[\[([0-9]{4}|[0-9]{4}s|[0-9]{3})\]\]</li>
<li>Any century such as: '20th century', '20th Century', '1st century'</li>
<li>Any month/year combination such as 'February 2002'</li>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You will have seen that I reverted a couple of your changes (to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Marathon_7ed7.html" title="London Marathon">London Marathon</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rapid_transit_systems.html" title="List of rapid transit systems">List of rapid transit systems</a>). I've no fundamental quarrel with your crusade to reduce the number of year links, and since I've been aware of this issue I've cut down my usage of them. However these two articles contained long lists full of linked years, and just unlinking 2005 and leaving all the others looked silly. I will attempt to rectify these two articles properly myself, but thought you might like to reconsider the way you are unlinking so as to do all years in a given articles at one go. Regards. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 13:51, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right. It did look silly to remove just one in a long list. The problem was my ignorance of the <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_AutoWikiBrowser_3ae1.html" title="User:Bluemoose/AutoWikiBrowser">AutoWikiBrowser</a> software. I can now do all years in a single pass but it is still a manual process. Thank you for fixing the articles. We are getting a fair amount of support for a bot to do this automatically but the argument is not won yet.

<p>Thanks, nice that someone noticed. I actually was inspired to do this by your year unlinking... I hadn't heard of AWB before I noticed some of your edits (great work, by the way!). As for the <i>?</i>s, you're absolutely right, they're ugly. And as these parameters are optional in the template now, it's probably better to just leave them out altogether - That's what I'll do in the next batch when I come across them. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 10:45, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sometimes, a stand-alone year link should not be deleted. For instance, the <a href="../../../1/1/1/1117.html" title="1117">1117</a> link from <a href="../../../m/i/i/Miidera.html" title="Miidera">Miidera</a> takes you to a page where <s>the construction of</s><i>a battle between the members of</i> Miidera is framed with some other concurrent historical events. There are other year links on Miidera which don't have the same type of info on the other end; but, I think that 1117 should stay. One way to tell what is important (in the sense that there is a link from the year's page to the article) is to check the "What links here". Your almost-bot may do that already, but it is something I noticed and remembered the recent talk I had a few sections up. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 11:56, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the software does not do it. Massive overlinking of dates throughout Wikipedia has meant that readers have no way of knowing which of the many links on a page contain useful information. If it is not possible for a reader to discriminate, it is difficult to define rules for software.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not agree that the 1117 link is useful but you have suggested a clear rule. I think that you are proposing a rule that is clear:</dd>
<dd>1. Look at ArticleA</dd>
<dd>2. Look inside the article for year link e.g. ArticleB, ArticleC etc</dd>
<dd>3. Go to ArticleB and looks at 'What links here'</dd>
<dd>4. Check if 'What links here' of ArticleB contains ArticleA</dd>
<dd>5. Use that information to modify the delinking rule.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know how to do it. The date delinking regex is published in the talk page so you can see what it does. Feel free to suggest modifications. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 19:10, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The rule as you wrote it is not quite right. The 'What links here' you need to look at is of Article A</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Look at ArticleA (In this case, Miidera)</dd>
<dd>2. Look inside the article for year link e.g. ArticleB, ArticleC etc (So, 672, 859, 1117, 1599, etc)</dd>
<dd>3. Look at 'What links here' of ArticleA for any year links (A link from 1117 in this case) <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Mii-dera_ae4a.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Mii-dera">Special:Whatlinkshere/Mii-dera</a></dd>
<dd>4. Remove any years found in 3 from the list formed in 2 (1117)</dd>
<dd>5. Unlink the remaining years in the list from 2 (672, 859, 1117, 1599) -- Not 1117.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, the bot would need to get not only the article, but the Whatlinkshere/ page(s). Processing the Whatlinkshere pages to find links to the main article from year pages is trivial. But I don't know enough about bots to know if they can be programmed to act on two pages at once, or not. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:46, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bobblewik, this is just to thank you for your work in getting rid of overlinked dates. I've added my support to the page regarding your bot. I always used to link standalone years (e.g. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), because I saw everyone else doing it and assumed it was part of the MoS. Since realizing it wasn't, I've been removing them wherever I see them, including from early articles I wrote, but it's very helpful to have your bot around to do it.

<p>A lot of folks are vexed by year links, one way or the other. Generally, I'm low key about people adding or removing year links from my articles, but there are some cases where I think the case for year links is unambiguous. For example, in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_literature.html" title="Restoration literature">Restoration literature</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_literature.html" title="Augustan literature">Augustan literature</a> and their daughter articles, the articles themselves are historical surveys. Hence, anyone there is already interested specifically in the progress/regress/stasis of history over an epoch. Year links there make all the sense in the world. Whether they make sense in a biography or not, I'm not sure. Certainly they make little sense in contemporary years, where the reader knows more about the years than the year articles can say, but the goal of the year entries is to provide a quick overview, a semi-tabular presentation of the significant events in a year. Hypothetically, every time someone makes a year link, they're to go to the year article and add to it, as well (rarely happens). Anyway, for historical survey articles I've done I'll probably revert to year links. Otherwise, I probably won't get involved. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:31, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. A lot of these can be caught by looking at 'What links here' from date elements like <a href="../../../t/u/e/Tuesday.html" title="Tuesday">Tuesday</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a>. Unfortunately I cannot correct bizarre linking involving numerics like <a href="../../../2/2/_/22.html" title="22">22</a> <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a>.

<p>Why are you still changing linking formats when you know that there is a lot of opposition to doing so, particularly en masse?

<p>I'm writing because I normally agree with reducing the overlinking of dates, but in the case of Invasion (or any list of historical events) I think linked dates are good because it allows readers to quickly put them into context with other events. It also serves as an internal cite, in a way, because readers can confirm that those events did, indeed, happen during that year and in certain cases see the exact date. These are not random links thrown into a paragraph; they are specific to each event. I do agree that unlinking the date in the caption of the photo was good; I'm going to revert your changes to the list (just because it's much easier than re-linking them all by hand) but I will keep that one.

<dd>If you look in 'My preferences' at the top of your edit window, you will see that you can format dates (e.g. 29 January 2006 -&gt; January 29, 2006) according to your preference. It only works for users that have an account and have chosen to set it. I don't happen to find it useful, so I don't use it, but it exists. It only works with some date formats. Other date elements (e.g. a solitary year like 2003) are not changed by the preference setting and therefore do not need the square brackets for that purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the use of square brackets for two things:</dd>
<dd>1. Date preferences</dd>
<dd>2. Hyperlinks</dd>
<dd>means that some people are misled into believing that *all* date elements should be linked. It is all explained at:

<dd>Bobblewik, you know that there is a <i>lot</i> of controversy over that guideline, with quite a lot of opposition to it. People have asked you nicely to refrain from making mass changes to articles you don't usually edit until this is sorted out, and you've kept doing so en masse, despite having been twice blocked previously for doing so. As such, I've blocked you for 24 hours.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>

<dd>If you wish to make these sort of edits, why not use a second account? This would avoid the need for your main account to be blocked to stop these edits from being made en masse. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:25, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really would prefer not to make these edits. However, this problem is widespread and a very noticable feature of Wikipedia so I think something should be done. As I have repeatedly said: if implementing the Manual of Style is a problem, then we should change the Manual rather than complain about editors that use it for reference. Incidentally, the 50 minutes of fast edits you refer to were drunken editing, otherwise I have been trying to keep the speed down to avoid provoking people such as yourself with blocking powers. However, the matter is that of the principle of date links and we both would like this to be resolved in the Manual of Style.</dd>

<p>I'm not going to get into the debate of whether year links should be removed or not, as I have no real strong opinion on the issue. I would ask, though, that you please be more careful in your efforts to remove these date links to not remove links to things that are not dates. The topic header is the specific example that brought this to my attention. On the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Maps_6042.html" title="Google Maps">Google Maps</a> page you removed the link to "911", with the edit summary of removing date links. But in this case, the link was not a date, but the phone number for the US emergency telephone system. Now, the link was bad, as the correct page for this system is <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a>, and I have replaced the link on the G-maps page, correcting it as well. But the link should not have been removed as a date when it is not a date. Reguardless of whether date links should be removed, links to the 911 system pages fall outside that effort, and should be either fixed or left intact. (Preferably fixed, but I know that's outside the scope of your current effort.) I would bet that the majority of links to <a href="../../../9/1/1/911.html" title="911">911</a> should actually link to <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a>, so unless you want to examine each for context, you may be better off just leaving that one number untouched by your efforts. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 12:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with other people that say that solitary year links are rarely needed. Linking things like <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_popular_music.html" title="American popular music">American popular music</a> is useful because nobody could guess that the permutation of plain english words would have an article. Anybody interested in any of the thousands of date element articles can enter them in the search box. In that respect, readers do not need their attention drawn to the presence of a date articles any more than plain english articles. I do note that you take a different view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You say that links to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> etc should be stripped. This puts us both in agreement about the principle of reducing overlinking to dates. We merely disagree about the extent. This problem has grown much larger than the problem of linking to plain english words. Perhaps there needs to be more debate about how exactly to reduce the overlinking rather than leaving it up to individuals.

<dd>The average reader certainly knows general historical trends in the 1900s but needs some touchstones to know historical context in the 1600s. Obviously there is no clear line, which is why I think it requires careful case-by-case consideration of what will help the reader.

<dd>As far as your Albert Einstein example is concerned, that is different to my example. I was merely making a comparison with plain english words. 'Albert Einstein' is not one plain english word, it is two non-plain english words. Perhaps I did not communicate the idea very well. If I understand you correctly, you are applying the following style guidance:</dd>
<dd>1. Link to solitary years to make the reader's job easier.</dd>
<dd>2. Do not link solitary years in the 1900s but link to solitary years in the 1600s.</dd>
<dd>Both those are valid propositions for you to follow even though I do not follow them myself. Unfortunately the Manual of Style does not contain such guidance. It actually opposes the first. The interesting concept of a date threshold (e.g. between 1600 and 1900) has been mentioned before but is currently totally absent.</dd>

<dd>There is a huge mismatch between the guidance and the implementation. Quite a few of us that think that guidance on date links need more clarity, or more implementation, or both. Perhaps you might agree with me on that. If more constraints are added along the lines you suggest, that is fine by me. I would be very happy if you were to raise this on the MoS talk page. Perhaps new wording can emerge that satisfies more people.

<p>My only problem is that once the year has been delinked a sentence fragment like "arriving on the east coast around 900 with his teenage son" looks slightly awkard.

Personally I find that clicking on a year is a great way to get some context of the event, and linking is definitely useful in most cases. Also note that almost all featured articles have linked years. Seeing that more people have protested here, I think you should consider trying to get some community consensus before making these changes to multiple articles (personally I think you will find that most people appreciate linking years, but I'm not sure). <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunes_c5a1.html" title="User:Junes">Junes</a> 16:53, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of the protests that you mention are from editors that are unaware of the guidelines or disagree with them. If those guidelines do not provide an adequate represention of community consensus, they should be changed. The process is straightforward. If you want to propose a change of wording to the guidelines that I have been using, feel free to do so on the relevant talk pages of the guidelines.

<dd>Hi Bobblewik, I reverted most of your link removals at <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_and_heads_of_state_of_Ethiopia_ea83.html" title="Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia">Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia</a> because I believe that in a table or list of rulers the dates that their reigns began or end are relevant links &amp; need to be kept as a help to the reader. However, reviewing your edits, I do agree with some of them (for example, I don't know how links were added to months alone at some points), &amp; made an effort to remove some of the year links -- although in a manner different than you had done. I hope you understand my reasoning &amp; that you consider making an exception for explicit lists of this kind. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reasoned response. There is widespread misunderstanding and some people think everything has to be linked. It is not only months (as you have seen), it is even days of the week! I think the problem started because square brackets are used for two purposes:
<ul>
<li>1. 'date preferences'</li>
<li>2. 'hyperlinks'.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There is some debate about separating those two functions in order to reduce the confusion. In the meantime, as I say, the guidance is at:
<ul>

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am glad that you can now see that date linking has gone too far and have done some delinking. If people did not go berserk with date links, then there would not be such a need for a cull. Your suggested guideline for reign dates is certainly 'implementable' but it is not currently in Manual of style. I don't happen to agree that such years are worth linking but if you proposed rewording the Manual of style to include that guideline, I would be happy to discuss the pros and cons along with many other editors. The guidelines as used by myself and many other editors could then be changed if necessary. I will try to avoid that page if I can and I do not mind if your revert or otherwise modify any of my edits.

<dd>Yes, I really would like to agree with you but that is not how I think at the the moment. Perhaps when you argue your case and others join in the debate, I may understand a bit more about the practical application of your proposal. Unfortunately, the status quo is a serious mismatch between guidance and the implemented links. We need to change either the implemented links or the guidance or perhaps a bit of both. There has been a fair amount of discussion about the guidance but only a few editors actually implementing it. Many editors are unaware of the guidance and have a mistaken and fuzzy groupthink that date elements should generally be linked when that is almost the opposite of the guidance.</dd>

<dd>My agreement is not important anyway if enough other people agree to a proposal for change. That is the great thing about Wikipedia. I will go along with the Manual of style even if it changes. Take your time and look at the existing guidance and previous discussions. I am sure that I will notice if and when you make a proposal in the talk page of the Manual. In the meantime, I am happy that we have agreement in some of the other respects.</dd>

<dd>Bobblewik, This last set of comments has helped me crystallize what I think is the main reason you keep getting blocked for your edits. I think that since many people feel that the year de-linking is disruptive, and since the MoS only says "there is no need to link it", "should only be linked if there is a strong reason for doing so", and "it's usually undesirable to insert"... but, none of these are flat out forbidden. Nor, does the MoS say "all date links should be removed". By removing so many links, it is essentially making a blanket statement that there is no "strong reason" for the links in the first place.</dd>

<p>Bobblewik, you've been asked nicely, you've been given a short block as a warning, and you continue making these changes at rapid speed, despite it being obvious (as evidenced by your own talk page) that many people view these changes as being disruptive and not being supported by consensus or policy. <i>Please</i> discontinue until this is sorted out, or I will have to block until such an assurance can be given. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:22, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He has not been revert-warring over this. Many of us welcome the changes and those who don't revert them without problems so I don't really see any disruption. But perhaps Bobblewik could add something like "revert freely" to his edit summaries to make it clearer that he is just making a suggestion rather than trying to force the issue. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 07:56, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is massive overlinking of dates in Wikipedia articles that contravenes policy as stated in:

<dd>My edits are intended to improve Wikipedia articles and bring them into line with that policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the complaints are from people that are unaware of, or disagree with, that policy. I have also received praise, and there is a silent majority that make no complaint or praise. If implementing the Manual of Style is a problem, then those that disagree should change the Manual rather than complain about editors that use it for reference. Ambi has made some specific suggestions and I will address these:
<ul>
<li>I should not make fast edits. I am now trying to keep the sustained rate below 120 edits per hour. I understand that is in-line with guidance. If it is not, please tell me what the limit is.</li>
<li>I should suspend editing of this type. I did refrain from implementing current policy on basis of 'until this is sorted out'. it did not get sorted out. I even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Proposed_discussion_on_update_to_the_Manual_of_Style" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Proposed_discussion_on_update_to_the_Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">proposed some revised wording</a> myself. that would have added constraints but nobody responded. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#When_does_an_objection_to_MoS_guidance_become_meta-guidance.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#When_does_an_objection_to_MoS_guidance_become_meta-guidance.3F" rel="nofollow">I noted</a> I have now lifted my voluntary suspension. If you think my previous suspension was too short then please tell me what the time period should be. If people have new wording for the Manual, then I can understand a desire for a suspension. Suspending a policy or a constitution on the basis of 'until this is sorted out' is too vague. Suspensions of policy should be</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>stated in scope and duration</li>
<li>reasonable in scope and duration</li>
<li>only in place while the proposer of the suspension is active in proposing new policy</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If there is no limit on such a suspension, it becomes 'meta-guidance' (as I noted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#When_does_an_objection_to_MoS_guidance_become_meta-guidance.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#When_does_an_objection_to_MoS_guidance_become_meta-guidance.3F" rel="nofollow">my comment</a> of 21 January).</dd>

<p>Policy on Wikipedia has always been an attempt at writing down the views and wishes of the community. You know that there is quite a lot of opposition to your edits, so you're using a bot to try and change them across the entire project before your critics can get the policy changed back to what it was before you began this crusade. This is really poor form.</p>
<p>I don't care if you change it on articles you write, for instance - the same treatment that applies to BCE/CE. What I care about is forcing the issue across the board, on articles you would never even bother reading, let alone writing, and effectively taking the attitude of "fuck consensus" because you have a bot and can get away with it.</p>
<p>As such, I've again imposed a preventative block. I will happily unblock if either a) you agree to make bot edits (i.e. 120/hour - far more than can be reverted manually without massive effort) from a seperate account, as most people with bots do, so your main account can be left untouched or b) stop making bot edits until it is clear that you have even majority, let alone consensus support for them, when it is very far from clear that is the case. When you're making changes on such a massive scale, it is the height of rudeness to impose them regardless of what anyone else thinks. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. Thanks for making changes to articles according to the MoS! This really helps to give Wikipedia a consistent look-and-feel, and makes things more professional-looking. I am a programmer and know just the basics of perl, but I've never been able to write a bot, and I'm always grateful to those that can and do, in the interest of improving Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In regards to the conflict above with unlinking dates: I frequently defer to Ambi on policy issues, and I know she consistently works hard to protect the project, but I have to disagree in this case. It's quick and easy to bring pages inline with the MoS, and if the MoS changes, it'll be quick and easy to change things back. Yes, that would be a hit on the servers, so it would be best to figure out policy before making the change - but it doesn't look like this particular policy is in flux. Perhaps an RFC should be started on whether a "delinking years" bot should be run, whether it's alright to delink years without a bot (as I do frequently), what years a bot should delink (e.g. 1900+ only), and whether the MoS should be changed. Either way, even if there is disagreement, I think you deserve thanks for taking the initiative to bring Wikipedia up to MoS standards.</p>
<p>I've often wanted to create and run a bot to change unlinked dates or improperly linked dates to standardized dates. Something like r/(January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) ([1-9][1-9]?),? ([1-9][1-9][1-9][1-9])/\[\[\1 \2\]\] \[\[\3\]\]/</p>
<p>Could you help me get started on getting something like this going? I only have access to Windows machines, unfortunately.

<dd>I stuck my toe in the water although it seemed to make more sense to start under your<i>Formal request for help</i>. Following the back and forth between your opponents and others it does not seem that there any substantial arguments have been advanced in favour of linking every separate year, day, month just "it's what we always do". Which in the end turns into an argument in favour of never making any edits at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Technical question. If putting double square brackets around a date (so as to allow user preferences) is not strictly speaking creating a link what is the technical term for putting double square brackets around text? It's not "linking" necessarily or is it? Most people say "linking dates" as though any and all use of double square brackets create a link. Just a pointer in the right direction would be a help. Since anyonce can edit anything round here the Help page keeps getting shifted around and its like first day at school every time I hie me off there.</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your willingness to intervene so I will consider it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I previously suspended date edits. But no new proposal for guidance was put forward. That suspension was merely an extended ban on implementation. There was no scope limit or time limit. So it just frustrated both sides even more and added another layer or dissatisfaction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can see this problem in complaints about editing speed: for months the speed issue has been part of complaints. But those complaining did not state the speed limit. Now that the speed limit has been stated, I am staying within it and the speed complaints have just about vanished.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So if there is a suspension of MoS implementation that applies to all editors, I think it is reasonable to document the specific MoS text that cannot be implemented and for how long. That could be something as sweeping as a note in the MoS (possibly in the <i>Usage of links for date preferences</i> section) saying:
<ul>
<li><i>Guidance on date links is under discussion. Do not add or remove links to non-preference date elements. This prohibition is temporary and will expire on [date].</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But that is just a suggestion so that you see what I mean.</dd>

<dd>I really think that these are reasonable changes. However, they should take place under a bot flag. There are several bots that currently function with human input.</dd>
<dd>If you request a bot flag at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> and use a bot account to make these changes, then I doubt anyone can really oppose them.

<dd>I am not sure why that is happening. It could be the quotes or it could be something odd happening with the hyphens. Operation with ISO dates is more difficult to debug.

<p>I notice you've started your mass-delinkings again, even after being explicitly asked not to by Jimbo. Discussion as to what to do about these is still ongoing, and you've made virtually no attempt to participate. You really should know better than this by now, so I've blocked you for a week. I will, however, unblock you right now if you'll guarantee that you won't make any more mass-unlinkings until the situation is clarified. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 01:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see any mass delinking this time, just a few solitary edits which look like Bobblewik's testing a script. Anyone mind if I unblock? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:28, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I say unblock. He is not using a bot therefore the block is unwarranted. Whatever happened to the concept of <b>be bold</b>? Especially given the level of support for the kind of edits that Bobblewick is making. Sure, he may make a few mistakes, don't we all, but Ambi is treating bobblewick as if he is a vandal. If this is a real problem then an RfC would be much more appropriate forum rather the these continual blocks. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 18:44, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, when Ambi or Talrias block him for mass delinking I've been unable to obtain a consensus for an unconditional unblock. But surely a few stray delinking edits aren't blockworthy - lots of people incidentally link or delink dates as they go about their business. I'll go ahead with an unblock now, I hope I'm not stepping on anybody's toes. Tread lightly, Bobblewik. Maybe we could form a WikiProject to intelligently organize the linking of dates? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 19:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about running a process (bot or manual project) to propose the de-linking on the talk pages viz:</p>
<pre>
==Date delinking project==
It is planned to delink the following list of date fragments in one weeks time.
Please remove from the list any that you think should remain linked in the article.

...came to port in <b>[[</b>1923<b>]]</b> and set sail...
...met his sweetheart in <b>[[</b>July<b>]]</b>  of that year
...and later in the <b>[[</b>14th century<b>]]</b>  he sawed several...

<dd>The project seems a good idea. But I can't imagine how that particular method would operate in practice. The large amounts of extra content in talk pages might be annoying in itself. Apart from adding the proposal, the rest is wholly manual so I suspect it would grind to a halt due to the enormous effort required. However, that is just my view. We could test the effect of the 1 week notice thing right now on ten pages and see what happens. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 21:41, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would need to automatically pick the text off the talk page, and implement the changes. "The large amounts of extra content in talk pages might be annoying in itself." is probably more relevant. I am also concerned that the project not revisit the same link multiple times, but needs to be able to revisit a page. Perhaps some more thought. By the way I make it 297000 articles with bare years in them , so it certainly would be a big project. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 23:20 <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_March_c77d.html" title="23 March">23 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<p>So I've been working on delinking year links following other links that aren't valid date links and I got it working, at least in Perl. I hope you know Perl! Here's my test script:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

#In this test case a year link can be delinked unless it is
#preceded by a month link to [[January]] or [[February]].
#Obviously this is incorrect but it works as a test case.

print "These should be delinked.\n";
testDate('[[Floopuary 99]] [[1997]]');
testDate('[[Anwar]] [[2004]]');
testDate('[[Season]] [[2006]]');

print "\nThese should not be delinked.\n";
testDate('[[January 20]] [[2004]]');
testDate('[[December 18]], [[1987]]');
testDate('[[February 14]] [[2004]]');
testDate('[[19 May]] [[1492]]');

sub testDate {
    my $testCase = shift(@_);
    print $testCase . " -&gt; ";
    my $month = qr/(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)/;
    if ($testCase =~ /\[\[([^\]]+)\]\](,?\s*)\[\[(\d+)\]\]/) {
        my $one = $1;
        my $two = $2;
        my $three = $3;
        if ($one =~ /$month \d\d?/) {
            $testCase = '[[' . $one . ']]' . $two . '[[' . $three . ']]';
        }
        elsif ($one =~ /\d\d? $month/) {
            $testCase = '[[' . $one . ']]' . $two . '[[' . $three . ']]';
        }
        else {
            $testCase = '[[' . $one . ']]' . $two . $three;
        }
    }
    print $testCase . "\n";
}
</pre>
<p>As you can see it's a bit more complicated than a simple switch regex. I did some research and that would require a variable length look-behind, which is apparently very difficult to implement (it isn't implemented in Perl and I'm sure it's not in JavaScript). So I had to do it a different way; I had to test everything that matched the regex "two links in a row" and, if the second one was a year link but the first one wasn't a valid date, delink. This only works for single expressions but it shouldn't be hard to put it in a global pattern matching loop and loop through all occurrences. I'm just not familiar enough with JavaScript to figure that out on my own! For completeness sake here is the output of the above program:</p>
<pre>
These should be delinked.
[[Floopuary 99]] [[1997]] -&gt; [[Floopuary 99]] 1997
[[Anwar]] [[2004]] -&gt; [[Anwar]] 2004
[[Season]] [[2006]] -&gt; [[Season]] 2006

These should not be delinked.
[[January 20]] [[2004]] -&gt; [[January 20]] [[2004]]
[[December 18]], [[1987]] -&gt; [[December 18]], [[1987]]
[[February 14]] [[2004]] -&gt; [[February 14]] [[2004]]
[[19 May]] [[1492]] -&gt; [[19 May]] [[1492]]

<dd>If it works, that is fine. I don't know how to convert it though. I did think of improving the current regex. It is crude though. The current version does this: ([char1_is_not_date]). We could test three characters back:
<ul>
<li>([char1_is_not_date]|[any_char1][char2_is_not_date]|[any_char1][any_char2][char3_is_not_date])</li>

<dd>My current test is:([\w\(\);=:.\*\|\&amp;]\s?,?\-?\s?]) I do not know what your \s* is testing for, is it an infinite series of spaces? More importantly, I do not know how I could embed a [^\s*] within my current test.

<dd>I knew that \s tests for a space character and * permits multiples. But I do not know what your test is doing in plain english.</dd>
<dd>As far as <i>You repeat \s? in your []</i> is concerned, that is my misquote of the regex. It is actually:

<dd>I am trying to deal with permutations of spaces, commas and hyphens. I overlooked ndash, mdash and will attempt to add those.

<li>character 1 e.g. the 'h' in 'March'.</li>
<li>character 2 e.g. the 'c' in 'March'.</li>
<li>character 3 e.g. the 'r' in 'March'.</li>

<dd>No problem, anyway, it appears that the regex here is pretty much identical to that in Perl (I copy-pasted it and it worked the same, even the really complex stuff). So Perl is probably a good testbed platform. As you see with what I did, I put together a bunch of test regexes and a bunch of test text and ran every possible combination. That would take an awfully long while to do manually in Wikipedia. If you need some help with Perl, there's lots of good tutorials out there, and if you need further or specific help, just ask me. As long as you're familiar with some programming language, which I'm assuming you are, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what the programs I've been posting on here do. By far the hardest part in them is the regex, but you already know the regex! The rest is just control structures; very easy. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 04:20, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, a thought: I notice that for "March 4, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>", datestest suggests "March 4, 2003", not "<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>". Would it be a good idea for datestest to suggest <i>linkng</i> appropriate dates, in addition to delinking inappropriate ones? – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 04:22, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest, I haven't yet found a single page that has an <i>underlinking</i> problem.

<dd>The design concept is to 'remove square brackets from dates that do not work with preferences'. So it is operating correctly to delink text such as March 4, [[2003]] because that does not work with preferences.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I accept/tolerate the current date preference mechanism but I don't use it or like it. It does not work for users that do not log in. It does not work for the many logged in users that have not set it. Most of us read unambiguous dates like 'December 25' and '25 December' without a second thought. Yes, I would like all dates to have a single format but the current cure applied to all is worse than the disease that few people have.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would rather not accept a second design concept to 'add square brackets to dates so that preferences work'. There is one exception in the code and that is to change [[March 4th]] into [[March 4]]. It was not my idea to do this but I accepted the suggestion.</dd>

<dd><i>Answer to Cyde</i>. I am impressed by your perl code but I do not have much energy left for learning it. It certainly helped with debugging. I think you overestimate my programming abilities.

<li>The script changes "[[June 25]] – [[June 26|26]], [[1876]]" to "[[June 25]] – 26, 1876".

<ul>
<li>"[[19th century|19th-century]]" is currently changed to "19th century". It should probably stay as "19th-century", since it's correct to hyphenate a two-word phrase when it is used as an adjective (like "two-word" is above). – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 13:32, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm. Quote: <i>If you take the hyphen seriously, you will surely go mad</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many guidelines are opposed the idea that 'hyphen = adjective'. The Wikipedia articles e.g. (<a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>) have no hyphen and google shows both formats in popular use. Some people suggest thinking of a hyphen as a <i>tool to resolve ambiguity between interpretations</i>.</dd>
