<p>The descendent of slaves acquired by the slave trading family that founded <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_University_180e.html" title="Brown University">Brown University</a>. He began singing with schoolmates <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Bivins_c4cc.html" title="Michael Bivins">Michael Bivins</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Bell_%28singer%29_9876.html" title="Ricky Bell (singer)">Ricky Bell</a> in 1980. The group, which would later include <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Tresvant_f9ad.html" title="Ralph Tresvant">Ralph Tresvant</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_DeVoe_41b7.html" title="Ronnie DeVoe">Ronnie DeVoe</a>, developed into New Edition and, after a few talent show wins, were discovered by producer <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Starr_c298.html" title="Maurice Starr">Maurice Starr</a>. Starr signed the group to his label and co-authored its debut hit, "Candy Girl", in 1983, which helped get New Edition a deal with <a href="../../../m/c/a/MCA_Records_8b22.html" title="MCA Records">MCA</a>. Along with "Candy Girl", Brown and New Edition scored several other pop and R&amp;B hits in the early 1980s, including "Mr. Telephone Man", "Cool It Now", and "Is This The End". After a few moments of teen stardom, Brown longed to move on to an adult solo career. His disruptive behavior led to Brown being kicked out of New Edition in 1985; he was replaced by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Gill_900f.html" title="Johnny Gill">Johnny Gill</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. Brown released his debut solo album, <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Stage_b0ec.html" title="King of Stage">King of Stage</a></i>, in 1986, and while it didn't make a name for Brown as a pop star, it did spawn an R&amp;B hit in the ballad "Girlfriend". <i>King of Stage</i> gave little indication that Brown was about to become a breakout star on the cutting edge of modern R&amp;B.</p>
<p>For his follow-up, Brown sought a more distinctive musical identity in the budding <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_jack_swing.html" title="New jack swing">new jack swing</a> movement. He enlisted the emerging production/songwriting team of <a href="../../../l/2E/a/L.A._Reid_f764.html" title="L.A. Reid">L.A. Reid</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babyface.html" title="Babyface">Babyface</a> to handle the majority of the record, with new jack pioneer <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Riley_%28new_jack_swing%29_a8f4.html" title="Teddy Riley (new jack swing)">Teddy Riley</a> coming onboard in a limited capacity as well. The result, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Be_Cruel_%28album%29_3cca.html" title="Don't Be Cruel (album)">Don't Be Cruel</a></i>, was a state-of-the-art, star-making affair. Released in the summer of 1988, the record produced Brown's first pop Top Ten hit in the title track, but really started to take off when the driving statement of purpose "My Prerogative" went to number one toward the end of the year. From there, <i>Don't Be Cruel</i> just kept spinning off hits: the ballad "Roni", the dance tune "Every Little Step" (which showed off Brown's rapping skills and earned him a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> in 1989 for Best Rhythm and Blues Vocal Performance-Male), and another ballad "Rock Wit'cha" all hit the Top 10 in 1989, with the former two both making it all the way to number three. <i>Don't Be Cruel</i> topped the album charts and sold a whopping seven million copies, making Brown a superstar. That same year, he was tapped to provide the theme song for <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters_II_25b7.html" title="Ghostbusters II">Ghostbusters II</a></i> and responded with the number two smash "On Our Own", another rap/R&amp;B mixture and "We're Back"; he also contributed a rap to friend <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Medeiros_1f34.html" title="Glenn Medeiros">Glenn Medeiros</a>' number one pop hit "She Ain't Worth It." Brown was so popular at this point that even his <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> remix album <i>Dance!...Ya Know It!</i> went platinum.</p>
<p>And then, somehow, the momentum began to slow. Countless other artists expanded on the new jack swing blueprint, with Brown's former New Edition colleagues Tresvant, Gill, and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Biv_Devoe_5012.html" title="Bell Biv Devoe">Bell Biv Devoe</a> at the forefront. Moreover, <i>Don't Be Cruel</i> made L.A. Reid and Babyface into hot commodities, and their sound was all over the airwaves. In 1989 he met pop singer Whitney Houston at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 1990 Bobby Brown reunited with his old New Edition groupmates at the 1990 Video Music Awards which also included his replacement Johnny Gill. In 1993 he reunited with them again for New Edition's spin-off trio <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Biv_DeVoe_d322.html" title="Bell Biv DeVoe">Bell Biv DeVoe</a>'s song Word To The Mutha! which featured all six members. Just before his new album, <i>Bobby</i>, was released in the summer of 1992, Brown married <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">Dance-pop</a> singer <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Houston_e07e.html" title="Whitney Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, who sang the duet "Something in Common" on the new record. <i>Bobby'</i>s lead single, "Humpin' Around", was a smash on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, reaching the Top 5 on the former; however, <i>Bobby</i> didn't sustain the momentum of <i>Don't Be Cruel</i>. Whatever the reason, sales of <i>Bobby</i> topped out at around two million copies, despite several more R&amp;B hits in "Good Enough", "Get Away", and "That's the Way Love Is." In 1993, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a> police arrested Brown for an overly suggestive stage performance, an incident that would prove to be the first of many legal difficulties for Brown over the next few years. In 1994 with his solo career at a stand-still, Brown and his the rest of the members of New Edition started talks of a reunion album and tour. In 1996 the group with all six members Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Ralph Tresvant, and Brown's replacement Johnny Gill came back together for their reunion album Home Again. The album went to number #1 on the charts and spawned the hits Hit Me Off, I'm Still Love With You, You Don't Have To Worry, and One More Day. The group then embarked on a tour with R&amp;B acts Keith Sweat and Blackstreet as their opening acts. The tour started off good but midway into the tour things started getting bad as the group started having internal conflicts and egos spirring out of control especially Bobby Brown as he started to wonder why he reunited with the group. Johnny Gill and Ricky Bell also threatned to quit the tour by missing shows. Brown and Tresvant also missed shows on the tour. Their conflicts took a turn for the worse on a tour date in New Mexico when Bobby was extending his solo set and cutting into Bell Biv DeVoe's time so New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe member Ronnie DeVoe went onstage during Brown's set and tryed to pull him off the stage. Brown then dropped his mic and left the stage starting a fight between Ronnie and Bobby and their unruly entourages as both of their security fired guns at each other but they misfired. The show was halted and in the aftermath Bobby Brown left the tour early along with Michael Bivins for unknown reasons. The remaining four continued the ill-fated Home Again Tour and the group again decided to separate with Brown making bad comments about his fellow group members. The fall of 97 he released his album Forever which featured the single Feelin' Inside as well as an appearance by his wife Whitney Houston and sister Coop B. The album failed to make the charts and was considered a flop. New Edition fans were also upset with Brown over his comments made about them. As Bivins, Tresvant, DeVoe, Bell, and Gill moved on to other projects, Bobby's career started to fall as he continued to get in trouble with the law. He also starred in a few movies during his time away from the studio. After serving 65 days in jail in 2000 he stated he wanted to get his life back in order. By the summer of 2001 Brown was reportedly working on a new album but was halted by a seizure. In 2002 he was in talks with Irv Gotti CEO of The Inc. (formely Murder Inc.) to sign with the label and then collaborated with The Inc.'s main artist hip-hop star <a href="../../../j/a/_/Ja_Rule_cab6.html" title="Ja Rule">Ja Rule</a> on his hit song Thug Lovin' from his fourth album The Last Temptation. He also got into more trouble later that year for speeding and possession of drugs. While Bobby got into trouble his old groupmates in New Edition reunited without him and started performing in small club venues and on Tom Joyner Skys Shows. The group caught the attention of Bad Boy Records CEO Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and he signed the group which featured Michael Bivins, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe, Ricky Bell, and Johnny Gill. While New Edition prepared for another reunion this time minus the group's bad boy Bobby was in and out of jail for probation violations, failure to pay child support, and domestic violence against Whitney Houston. His old groupmates said they were on good terms with Bobby and would welcome him back into the group anytime he was ready. Bobby Brown made surprise appearances on some of the tour dates and during a segment on VH1's Behind The Music Brown stated that he wanted to return to the group. In the fall of 2005 New Edition performed a some of their hits on BET's 25th Year Celebration and brought Brown onstage to perform Mr. Telephone Man. Brown then brought the house down with his big solo hit My Prerogative. It was announced later that Brown has rejoined New Edition and the group was a six man group again. He then started performing at concerts as a special guest with some of his fellow groupmates including Bell Biv DeVoe and Johnny Gill. At a Bell Biv DeVoe show which Brown performed with them because Ricky's voice went out it was announced that New Edition will have a new album and tour in 2008 with all six members. It will be their second album since Home Again as a sextet. In October 2004 "Don't Be Cruel" appeared in popular <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_e6da.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></i>, playing on <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">Soul</a> radio station <a href="../../../c/s/r/CSR_103.9_308a.html" title="CSR 103.9">CSR 103.9</a>. Brown has now rejoined New Edition. The group plans to record a new album, slated for a 2008 release.</p>

<p>In 1995, Brown was arrested after being accused of raping an under age prostitute. (Charges were later dropped when Brown settled out of court.) Several months later, Brown was charged with battery in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> after allegedly kicking a hotel security guard who tried to halt a party in Brown's room (he was sentenced to two years' probation). The same year, Brown checked himself into the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Ford_Clinic_b270.html" title="Betty Ford Clinic">Betty Ford Clinic</a> to battle drug and alcohol problems. However, in August 1996, he wrecked Houston's leased <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porsche.html" title="Porsche">Porsche</a> while speeding in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>; reportedly, his blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit. In the midst of all this chaos, Brown found time to record with the fully reunited New Edition, whose comeback album, <i>Home Again</i>, entered the charts at number one that fall. Brown toured with the group, but departed for good when the tour was over. Meanwhile, the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloids.html" title="Tabloids">tabloids</a> were having a field day over Brown and Houston's rumored marital problems; in 1997, Brown was accused of spousal abuse when Houston suffered a cut on her cheek during a yachting trip, although both Brown and Houston denied the reports.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1998, Brown was arrested for sexual battery stemming from an alleged incident in the <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_Hotel_f95a.html" title="Beverly Hills Hotel">Beverly Hills Hotel</a>, although no charges were filed for lack of evidence. He served five days in a Florida jail stemming from his drunk-driving incident, and after spending time in rehab, he was arrested again for allegedly having shown up at the jail drunk. Brown reportedly violated his probation by testing positive for <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> several times; while those charges were dropped, he was sentenced to 75 days in jail for refusing to take another drug test in the summer of 2000. Upon his release, Brown began working in earnest on a new album, which was derailed for a time when he suffered a <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seizure.html" title="Seizure">seizure</a> in the summer of 2001, reportedly from <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_exhaustion.html" title="Heat exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/h/Dehydration.html" title="Dehydration">dehydration</a>. It wasn't until 2002 that he really came back into the media spotlight; following a duet with rapper <a href="../../../j/a/_/Ja_Rule_cab6.html" title="Ja Rule">Ja Rule</a>, he was captured by the police for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> possession and driving without a license after a routine stop for speeding.</p>
<p>In 2003, Brown was charged with breaking the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_violence.html" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a> law in the USA against Houston. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/10/brown.charged/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/10/brown.charged/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
