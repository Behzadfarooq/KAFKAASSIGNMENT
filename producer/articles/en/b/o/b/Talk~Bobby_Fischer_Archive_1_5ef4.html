<p>Splitting this off was a good idea, but I think <i>this</i> should be the main Bobby Fischer page, and what's now <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">the main page</a> should be moved to Bobby Fischer (biography). After all, the only reason anybody's interested in his biography is because of his chess career.</p>

<p>I created this separate article because the original article had exceeded the Wikipedia length for articles. Previously there was no way to expand upon the chess career aspect of this subject, nor the biographical aspects. This separation now allows for both. Undoubtedly some editors will want to further tweak this article as well as expand upon it now that the space has been created. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 00:33, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Iam unhappy with this article, when it states that all Soviet players declined on principle to fight it out amongst each other early on in the stages of tournaments so they could solely force their attacks on the non-Soviet contingent. Where's the proof in this? I have read copious materials about the likes of Tal and Botvinnik, and they played not only for the glory of their country, but also themselves. Unless sufficient proof of this is given, I am slamming an NPOV warning on it pronto. --<a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnucmo2_ec08.html" title="User:Knucmo2">Knucmo2</a> 18:30, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is, of course, virtually impossible to prove such claims beyond all doubt, but I don't believe the article states it as fact anyway; rather, the way I read it, it says that it was possible in principle, that Fischer believed it happened, and that rules in later cycles were changed in response to his complaints. Perhaps a little rewriting could be done to make it clearer we're dealing with an opinion (albeit a rather widely held one) rather than definite fact, but I don't find the article <i>terribly</i> misleading as it stands. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Hello, and thanks for your response. Firstly, I always appeal to the talk pages if there is any dispute about something, to inhibit the possibility of an edit war, in other words, seeking others' implicit permission to do so. These errant claims need to be stated in the form of a claim, the article does not read as such, it reads more as a given. I do not know where you quote the <i>terribly</i>, it was not mentioned in my article. Nor did I suggest that the overall article, whatever can be meant by that, is misleading and deceptive. However, usually NPOV disputes usually mean the 'whole' of an article. Furthermore, an opinion widely held may be one worth stating for the history books, but it is certainly not one which increases its validity, which I am sure you will know.--<a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnucmo2_ec08.html" title="User:Knucmo2">Knucmo2</a> 23:10, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What happened really in 1975/76?</span></h2>
<p>Some years ago I read in several books and articles (german/dutch/french) that Robert Fischer met Anatoly Karpov at least three times personally at various locations in 1975/76. At least one source maintained that they met in Manila (other cited Bangkok), Tokyo and Madrid (Linares?), moreover some authors charged that Karpov successfully intimidated Fischer with some kind of psychological warfare. Assisted by KGB psychowarfare experts he was able to exploit Fischers personal weaknesses with the effect that Fischer was too frightened to play against him in Manila. Karpov keeps mum about these episodes and only acknowledges a meeting with Fischer in Spain in 1976 where Karpov agressively refused to play agaist Fischer on the old terms, because he considered himself as the legitimate champion. Are these allegations true or simple examples of common Soviet/Karpov bashing? Perhaps has some user more knowledge about this mysterious period? -- G.R.S 9 Jul 2005</p>
<p>Sounds too speculative to repeat in Wikipedia imo, especially since the sources disagree about even the basic facts. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 9 July 2005 05:54 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, history should not be based on cold-war speculation, thats like saying that Hemmingway killed himself because of a "special" treatment the CIA gaved him because of his friendship with Fidel Castro, a supposed treatment wich ultimately caused his depresion and suicide. Yet, such fact is untrue, is just pure especulation, and its just one of the many tales circulating in the middle of cold war. Anatoly Karpov retained his tittle for 10 years until 1985 when he lost against Kasparov.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">1992 Purse</span></h2>
<p>A $1m purse in 1992 is inconsistent with the following paragraph that states that Fischer took a $3.3m prize. I've changed it from $1m to $5m as that seems to be correct based on a few searches (and references at the bottom of the article.) I am in no way an expert; if someone knows better, feel free to improve (and explain!) <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlorg_b615.html" title="User:Blorg">Blorg</a> 14:53, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The total prize fund was $5m, of which Fischer, as the winner, was due $3.35m, the remainder going to Spassky (see, for example, Davies, Pein and Levitt, <i>Bobby Fischer: The $5,000,000 Comeback</i>). I believe there is some question-mark over whether either player actually received this amount, however--somebody might want to look into that. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a> 20:44, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC) (copied from <a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBobby_Fischer_1a65.html" title="Talk:Bobby Fischer">Talk:Bobby Fischer</a>)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fischer Jewish?</span></h2>
<p>I am removing this artice from the Jewish chess players category.

<dd><i>In modern usage, Jews include both those Jews actively practicing Judaism, and those Jews who, while not practicing Judaism as a religion, still identify themselves as Jews by virtue of their family's Jewish heritage and their own cultural identification.</i> I don't see which of these definitions matches Fischer. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 29 June 2005 01:25 (UTC)

<dd>You skipped the very first line of the article: "The word Jew (Hebrew: יהודי) is used in a wide number of ways, but generally refers to a follower of the Jewish faith, a child of a Jewish mother, or someone of Jewish descent with a connection to Jewish culture or ethnicity and often a combination of these attributes." Fischer's mother was Jewish, and the man likely to have been his biological father was Jewish too. There are many, many references that identify Fischer as ethnically Jewish, so unless you can find convincing references that say he's not Jewish, that claim is original research. You should note that he is correctly listed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html#Chess_Players" title="List of Jews">List of Jews#Chess Players</a> as well. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 5 July 2005 16:25 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> article is my reference. Given that we have a huge article dedciated to the controversy surrounding <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> which reaches no concrete conclusion and Fischer still disputes it, it seems that characterizing him as a Jew would be arbitrarily accepting one definition of "Jew" over another.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for pointing out <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html#Chess_Players" title="List of Jews">List of Jews#Chess Players</a>. I'm removing him now. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 5 July 2005 21:34 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>After looking at that article again, I think it's fine to have him on it since it seems to include anyone who could be considered Jewish by any conceivable definition. I'm still opposed to putting the category in this article, though I think it might be a good idea to mention the controversy somewhere in the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 5 July 2005 21:42 (UTC)

<dd>Fischer doesn't even (consistently) deny being Jewish -- he describes himself as "Part Jewish. My mother is Jewish." in the 1962 Ginzburg interview. I think it is reasonable to include in him in the category if according to <i>some</i> definitions he is Jewish. But in any case, I agree Fischer's complex relationship with Judaism is worth discussing in the article. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 6 July 2005 00:58 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I can tell, he hasn't always denied it, but he does now. You point is taken though. After further deliberation I think it would be okay to have the category as long as the body mentions that he vehemently denies being Jewish. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 6 July 2005 01:35 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting to note that Boris Spassky is also partly of Jewish ancestry ("mother Jewish") according to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html#Chess_Players" title="List of Jews">List of Jews#Chess Players</a>, and is also an anti-Semite like Fischer. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">billbrock</a></p>
<p>I previously put in a link to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> which I think is an acceptable compromise. If you read that link, you will see that some Jewish groups say, <i>"Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews, or practice a faith other than Judaism, are technically still Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent"</i>. Therefore, since whether Fischer is a Jew is open to debate, the link should remain, and I have reverted its removal. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 02:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that this is not a good idea: 1) The chapter is about his antisemitic views, not about his ethnicity. 2) The wording is IMHO far from perfect; why he "should be" considered to be Jewish himself? - the theory which is described in the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> is a Jewish/Sionist ideology, not relevant for most of the world population - allow me to think that Jews are simply those claiming to be Jews, please, just like with all other groups.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 11:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree on (1) that the link is in the wrong chapter. It belongs in the early chapter where his Jewish background is mentioned. On (2): the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>, while far from perfectly written, does present more than one view. There are <i>some</i> people who would regard Fischer to be a Jew - in fact, his type of situation is one of the 3 contentious areas discussed - so the question isn't settled 100%, so the Fischer article shouldn't say that it is. I've no problem with rewording it to suggest he is not a Jew, e.g. to say something like, <i>"Most people would not consider Fischer to be Jewish because he has renounced the Jewish religion - see <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>"</i>. However I think it is important to link to the article for people to read and decide. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 13:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't assume that people who disagree with you are "uneducated" -- I was already familiar with Chessmetrics and how their statistics works. My objection was not "Chessmetrics uses inaccurate statistical techniques" or similar. My point is that (a) citing something that is likely to be unknown to 95% of the audience is probably of limited value (b) puting an obscure citation in the introductory text of the article is not the right place (c) your revision removed a lot of useful content and was therefore not an improvement anyway. BTW, while I have no quarrel with Chessmetrics' "predictive value", is it actually an accepted and reputable reference source for chess statistics, or just a hobbyist's website?

<dd>I'm fine with a reference to Chessmetrics somewhere in the article body, I just didn't like it (a) being placed prominently in the introductory text as the main indication of Fischer's chess ability (b) replacing some decent descriptive text about Fischer's chess dominance. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 3 July 2005 07:06 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>He was the second American to have been hailed as world chess champion, the first being Paul Morphy in 1858 (though Morphy did not proclaim himself world champion, so Wilhelm Steinitz, who did, is considered the first official world champion). Fischer is considered by most to have been one of the hardest working and most gifted chess players of all time.</i></dd>

<dd>The first sentence is very wordy and has less to do with Fischer than with the general history of chess. The second is just vacuous and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">weasel language</a>. It's not clear what is meant by "most gifted" and its impossible to confirm whether he was indeed the "hardest working". I think Chessmetrics has made a good case that of reigning world champions he was the most dominant over the secondary competition, which is why I think it is a good candidate for a replacement- at the very least, it is relevant, verfifiable, and falsifiable. I would be happy with a better suggestion though. My main aim here is to improve that part of the introduction <i>somehow</i>. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">Malathion</a> 3 July 2005 07:38 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding Fischer as world champion, I agree the existing text could be improved. Perhaps just state that Fischer was the second American world champion, and explain the details of the Morphy situation in a footnote, or later in the article's text? About trying to have a "verifiable and falsifiable" way to talk about Fischer's dominance over the competition, I agree the current text is a bit weasly, but I'm not sure that a reference to a statistical database is an improvement (at least by itself). Even if Chessmetrics were a well-known, universally accepted way of assessing chess ability, just talking about statistics doesn't express Fischer's dominance with any "color". There are certainly plenty of grandmasters who have testified to Fischer's brilliance; perhaps we could say "Fischer was described by [ Tal / Petrosian / Keres / etc. ] as '...'" (insert your favourite positive assessment of Fischer). That would remove the weasel phrasing -- while not "falsifiable", a leading GM certainly qualifies as an expert whose opinion on Fischer's talent should carry some weight. Perhaps it is also worth mentioning the 1972 Spassky match in the introduction, as that was the apogee of Fischer's chess career. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 3 July 2005 13:49 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fischer's peak rating</span></h2>
<p>In Wikipedia entry "International Grandmaster", a list compiled by Przemek Jahr mentions Bobby Fischer's peak rating at 2785, while this entry mentions a peak rating of 2795.</p>
<p><a name="POV-section" id="POV-section"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV-section</span></h2>
<p>The section goes&#160;:</p>
<p><i>Fischer made several important contributions to chess theory. In particular, his success playing the Black side of the so-called "Poisoned Pawn" variation of the Najdorf Sicilian (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6!) revolutionized both the particular variation, and the way chess professionals viewed opening theory in general. Fischer's plan of quickly developing the queen and snatching a pawn violated centuries of time-tested opening principles, but through rigorous analysis, Fischer was able to prove that the variation was perfectly safe for the second player. Consequently, chessplayers began to weigh concrete analysis over blind adherence to principles, which has subsequently led to many similarly shocking discoveries.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The whole tone of the section is obviously not neutral. The author gives the impression that Fischer = God Almighty. How can that be neutral?</li>
<li>Since this is apparently not so obvious to everyone, concrete objects from my part are: "revolutionized..." = POV-word (one opening doesn't revolutionize anything, especially since he was its main adherent -- in fact, several grandmasters considered Fischer opening to be his weakest point (still dispoted))&#160;; "violated centuries of time-tested opening principles" = POV (chess changes all the time) "perfectly safe" = POV (if it was "perfectly safe" you would never lose), "Fischer was able to prove that the variation was perfectly safe for the second player" = POV (the variation is hardly played after Fischer lost the first game against Spassky in 1972)&#160;; "chessplayers began to weigh concrete analysis over blind adherence to principles" = POV (I really doubt that chessplayers before Fischer played according to "blind adherence of principles" Did <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimzowitsch.html" title="Nimzowitsch">Nimzowitsch</a>?

Since you feel the same way, apparently, you should have voted on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_who_have_beaten_Bobby_Fischer_in_chess_b048.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people who have beaten Bobby Fischer in chess">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_people_who_have_beaten_Bobby_Fischer_in_chess</a> VfD. ... Which you'd have been able to do if they'd ever bothered to link to that vote on this Talk page, where just about all the people involved and informed on the matter would have seen it and been able to vote, unlike practically hiding it on such a much more obscure sub-page. The failure to do that, plus the troubling fact that <i>all</i> the last few votes were for "keep" and the vote was closed almost immediately after this strong trend of keep votes began, makes me highly doubt the validity of the results of the aforementioned VfD. Just check out the vote timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>23 October: nominate; 1 delete, 1 keep</li>
<li>24 October: 3 merge, 2 delete, 2 merge or delete</li>
<li>25 October: nothing</li>
<li>26 October: 1 merge</li>
<li>27 October: nothing</li>
<li>28 October: nothing</li>
<li>29 October: nothing</li>
<li>30 October: nothing</li>
<li>31 October: 1 keep</li>
<li>1 November: 2 keep</li>
<li>2 November: nothing</li>
<li>3 November: nothing</li>
<li>4 November: 1 strong keep; closed</li>
</ul>
<p>The timeline shows that this closure was <b>definitely</b> premature, whether the results were accurate or not. And I don't think they were at all: consensus was <i>really</i> established, just look at the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>4 votes for delete</b></li>
<li><b>5 votes for merge</b></li>
<li><b>5 for keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>That looks like the <i>opposite</i> of a consensus to me - in fact, "merge" <strike>barely even got a basic majority, at 55.5%!</strike> <i>(I suck at math; it didn't even get anywhere near a majority, it got 35.7% of the votes)</i> It also got exactly as many votes as "keep" (less, in fact, if you don't count "delete or merge" as .5 votes for delete and .5 for merge and took the votes more literally, which would put "delete or merge" at 2, delete at 3 votes, merge at 4, and do not merge/keep at 5!), and hadn't gotten a single vote in <i>nine days</i>, out of the twelve total days allowed for the vote. Delete hadn't gotten a vote in eleven days, for that matter. Why was this ended so prematurely, right when voting was starting to pick up again after a five-day lull and the tide was very clearly turning? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 07:53, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, what? Are you <i>joking</i>? Redirect makes no difference whatsoever. I'm also getting slightly tired of the repeated accusations and attacks on my character, with claims like "just because you consider redirecting a bad option"—<i>when</i> did I ever state that I think redirecting is a bad option?! If we went ahead with deleting or merging rather than keeping, I'd think <i>not</i> redirecting was a bad idea!! "Merge and redirect" is more than obviously a vote for merge, the "redirect" is incidental and an unrelated issue that has nothing to do with any of the problems I mentioned above, and nothing to do with the vote in general; I doubt many of the people who didn't vote "redirect" oppose redirect, and any that do can simply bring up the page on "Redirects for delete". It's a matter <b>beyond trivial</b>, practically a red herring, and certainly a nitpick.</dd>
<dd>"but that's your opinion, not the opinion of those who said redirect too." - No, that's what you wish my opinion was, because straw men are easier targets than real ones. They don't move around as much. Hell, they practically jump into your attacks—because that's what you designed them to do.</dd>
<dd>"And what's this fuzz al labout?" - It's about a badly bungled VfD that needs reopening so it can be voted on properly. What do you think it's about?</dd>
<dd>"You accused me not to post a note here to attract more people for the discussion, but you didn't either!" - I didn't "accuse" you, I pointed out that <b>everyone</b> failed to link to the VfD on the page, which is a deep and terrible flaw in the voting. Your argument is a poster child for <i>tu etiam</i> <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks; I <i>admit</i> that I made the same mistake everyone else did. And that has nothing to do at all with the fact that it <i>was</i> a mistake, and thus needs <i>fixing</i>.</dd>
<dd>"How about opening a request for undelete then?" - Procedure is to discuss the matter with the admin who mistakenly deleted first, and only go to Request for Undelete if the matter can't be resolved among the two parties. I've been hoping that it can, that you'll be willing to let people's voices be heard in a revote or reopening of the vote.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fischer's IQ</span></h2>
<p>I remember discussing Fischer's IQ on a forum several years ago and the general consensus had been that the IQ of 180 was a speculation. Can someone provide an actual citation for this number?

<dd>Search Yahoo for "bobby fischer iq". There were plenty of references saying 180/181. There was a copy of a 1992 Esquire article (the first link, I think) saying 181.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 08:10, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Not sure if Esquire is that reputable. I'll stick with Frank Brady (a respectable former editor of Chess Life magazine and Fischer's main biographer) who claims Fischer's IQ to be 180, so I think that this is probably the number to put in the article, but I believe that a disclaimer should be there to note that *no one* knows if this is really true, even Fischer has no idea what his IQ is, according to Brady. See <a href="http://www.chessmaniac.com/Bobby_Fischer/Bobby_Fischer_Articles2.shtm" class="external free" title="http://www.chessmaniac.com/Bobby_Fischer/Bobby_Fischer_Articles2.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chessmaniac.com/Bobby_Fischer/Bobby_Fischer_Articles2.shtm</a> . Also, 180/181 are not the only frequent claims for Fischer's IQ, so is 187. It's sort of amusing though. For example, there is a website that "estimates" Fischer to be 187 (see <a href="http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list/aceviper_famous_people_iq_list.html</a> which has a bunch of essentially made up numbers), then there is another article which claims that this is in fact the exact result of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale for Adults. (See <a href="http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_questions_and_answers/aceviper_interesting_intelligence_related_questions_and_answers.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_questions_and_answers/aceviper_interesting_intelligence_related_questions_and_answers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aceviper.net/aceviper_net/ace_intelligence/aceviper_questions_and_answers/aceviper_interesting_intelligence_related_questions_and_answers.html</a></dd>
<dd>Also I have to point out now, while I'm at it, that a lot of this article smacks shamelessly of plagiarism. Compare "Fischer's academic records indicated an I.Q. of 180 with an incredibly retentive memory" in this article and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/fischer.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/fischer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/fischer.htm</a> which is chess master Bill Wall's page on this issue. I don't have time, but someone should go through and either cite or modify all these blatant copies from that and other websites. Stuff like this kills what used to be a featured article candidate.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fischer's proposed rules changes</span></h2>
<p>I have excised some incorrect statements about Fischer's proposed rules changes for the 1975 defense of his title. The lines read</p>
<dl>
<dd>This was the same champion advantage that had been used in previous Soviet world championships matches (e.g., Fischer's match with Spassky) and in other world championship matches since then so it was not controversial in the sense of being more unfair than prior matches. It was controversial in the sense that Fischer himself had previously argued that this advantage was unfair and that he would not insist upon it. Because FIDE changed the rules to give Fischer less of an advantage than Soviet players had enjoyed and because FIDE had accepted the match conditions of all prior world champions, ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>These lines contained errors, both large and small.</p>
<ol>
<li>There was no such thing as "Soviet world championships." They were world championships contested by Soviet players. Even though the World Heavyweight boxing champions have been overwhelmingly American, one would hardly refer to their title bouts as "American" world championships.</li>
<li>FIDE had not "accepted" prior match conditions, but <b>set</b> them. Indeed, if the champion wanted a rules change, it would tend to be looked upon favorably, <b>as were Fischer's</b>. FIDE accepted all of what Fischer wanted except for one point.</li>
<li>That last demand was definately considered to be considerably more unfair to the challenger. Under the previous system, with the match tied at 11.5-11.5, <b>whoever</b> won the next game would win the match. The champion's advantage was that, in the event of a draw, the champion would retain the title in a tied match. Under Fischer's conditions, with the match tied at 8-8, the challenger would have to win two games before the champion won any in order to take the title. The champion's advantage is that he need win only 9 games before the challenger won 10. By switching to a wins-only policy, scores could only increase by full points, not half-points. Instead of the old half-point advantage for the champion, the proposed system would give him a full-point advantage, double what it had been before.</li>
<li>The excised text notes Fischer's hypocrisy regarding his previous statements regarding the champion's advantage. It failed to note Fischer's equally hypocritical statements about Botvinnik. When Botvinnik, a working cybernetic engineer, was champion, Fischer denounced him for not participating in more chess events. Yet Fischer did not play even one game during his tenure as champion.</li>
</ol>
<p>One may accept Fischer's claim that he refused to play Karpov due to some high principle; one may also conclude that it was due to cowardice. Clearly, once one is champion, the only possible direction is down.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FIscher's rating officially peaked at 2780 not 2785</span></h2>
<p>It is a common misconception that Fischer's peak rating was 2785, and commonly and often repeated. He WOULD HAVE been 2785 had he not lost rating points in the match versus Spassky. The best way to verify this is to check the Informants from 1971 and 1972.</p>

<p>JzG has deleted the link <a href="http://www.ishi" class="external text" title="http://www.ishi" rel="nofollow">press.com/fischer1.htm Bobby Fischer Interview</a>, claiming it is a copyright violation. I have concerns about doing this, on a number of fronts. First, is a transcript of a radio interview a copyright violation in the first place? Second, if a radio broadcast is ordinarily copyright, does this change in the case of an interview with a famous person? i.e. the interview is an insight into Fischer's views. IMHO, they are statements on the public record which deserve to be preserved. Third, even if they are copyright violation, is there anything in Wikipedia policy to prevent <b>linking</b> to copyrighted material anyway? Unless I can be convinced there really is a copyright problem there, I say we should restore that link. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 01:16, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>JvG still says it's a copyright violation. OK, I agree that we shouldn't link to copyright violations, but I don't believe the transcript it is a copyright violation in the first place. The mp3s of this and other Fischer interviews already exist on the web at <a href="http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/" class="external text" title="http://home.att.ne.jp/moon/fischer/" rel="nofollow">Fischer's web site</a> (table just over halfway down). So since they've already consented to Fischer having the recordings, I don't think a transcript is violating the radio station's copyright. Nor do I see how it violates Fischer's copyright. On the positive, it is a transcript of a conversation by a public figure, for people who can't or don't want to listen to the entire mp3. So please explain why it's a copyright violation, or stop deleting the link. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 01:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The second match with Zuckertort was played in the USA. While one might quibble that Steinitz did not first "win the championship" as an American, I am adjusting the opening to "American-born". -Wfaxon 19:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is not the forum for a POV regarding Fischer's mental state or speculations about someone's religious background or ethnicity.

That would explain a lot. Did you know that the WWCOG saw themselves as British Israelites (i.e., chosen people who weren't Jewish?) And there's that strange change-of-name to "Robert D. James" in the Pasadena Courthouse years....

<dd>Yet another postscript: I had to restore the fact that Regina Wender was of Jewish ancestry (I have seen references to her as a Polish Jew, but she was definitely a cultural German, &amp; borders were in flux...). Nowhere in the article is it suggested that RWF was observant--indeed, that would be rather unlikely given her personal history. (Fischer has even claimed to be uncircumcised.)

<dd>Here's the crucial passage from the Inquirer article, which Edmonds &amp; Eidinow find credible:
<dl>
<dd><i>Agents made it their business to find out who Fischer's father was. They checked his birth certificate; it listed his father as Gerhardt Fischer. He and Regina Wender had married in Moscow in 1933.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>They divorced in 1945, two years after Bobby's birth, but the FBI believed they had been apart longer than that. Regina Fischer came here in 1939; the FBI said her husband never entered the United States.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI file says Gerhardt Fischer lived for a time in Chile, where he sold fluorescent lights and worked as a photographer.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI suspected he might have been a Soviet spy there in World War II, targeting Nazis. The evidence? In a letter to Regina Fischer, he had made what the FBI called a "cryptic" reference to photographing fishermen at a Chilean port.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The file noted that several German agents had been arrested there, posing as fishermen.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The FBI seemed to pay more attention to Regina Fischer's Hungarian friend, Paul Nemenyi.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nemenyi came to the United States in the 1930s, taught college mathematics, and met Regina Fischer in 1942, according to the files. An informant told the bureau that in 1947, Nemenyi opined that the Soviet system was "superior to that of the U.S."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nemenyi also took a deep interest in Bobby Fischer. He paid child support and complained to social workers about the way Regina was raising the boy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A social worker told the FBI of interviewing Nemenyi in 1948. This informant dutifully reported that as they spoke about Regina, Nemenyi had wept.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The heavily censored files don't say whether Nemenyi was Fischer's father. Letters obtained by The Inquirer offer an answer. They are the papers of Nemenyi's late son Peter, a civil-rights activist who gave them to a state archive in Wisconsin.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I take it you know that Paul was Bobby Fischer's father," Peter Nemenyi wrote after his father's death in 1952. The papers also include a plaintive letter that same year from Regina Fischer to Peter Nemenyi.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Bobby... was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question," she wrote. "I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the end, that's the picture the FBI was left with: nothing more than a worried single mother with a troubled son.</i></dd>

<p>This is getting silly. My point was that the focus of this encyclopedia article should be on Fischer's achievements as a chess player. That is why Fischer is famous. Fischer has commented publicly on baseball, and expressed opinions regarding Ichiro Suzuki breaking the major league hits record a few years ago. Should these Fischer statements be included in the Wikipedia article? Was Thomas Edison a Democrat? Should this be included in the Edison article? Maybe, farther down, briefly. From reading Mr. Brock's previous posts, I have learned that he was president of the Illinois Chess Association, and an accomplished chess player in his own right. Shouldn't the focus of the Fischer article be on Fischer the chess player? <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronCBurke_b9e8.html" title="User:AaronCBurke">AaronCBurke</a> 05:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fischer himself has turned the attention elsewhere in his numerous <b>broadcast</b> statements which he <b>continues to disseminate via his website</b>: per his most recent interview, he not only hates Americans and Jews, he also hates chess. But of course Fischer was once a chess player first, and I too would like to remember him as that, not as the self-hating American &amp; self-hating Jew he's become.... I accept the primacy of focus argument (in fact, I long ago noted in the "to do" section that 1970-72 section of his career was underrepresented, and I feel that the WWCOG section is a bit long). But don't use the primacy of focus argument to dodge unpleasant facts.</dd>

<dd>Should the article be split? Probably. How? I don't know.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 06:10, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Was <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> a Democrat?" Funny example to choose...I dunno, but I too would probably consider it NN in the context of a WP article. Was Edison an antisemite? Yes, and his biographers deal with it, but because he kept it to himself, it doesn't merit the same attention that it would in an article about Edison's friend <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"historical grounds"</span></h2>
<p>I agree that my characterization of Fischer's interview re 9/11 as "virulent" speech may be seen as non-NPOV by those who haven't bothered to listen to the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_b/mp3/F_19_1.MP3" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.jp/bobbby_b/mp3/F_19_1.MP3" rel="nofollow">mp3 rant</a>. But I'm curious as to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Fischer&amp;diff=73601630&amp;oldid=73544783" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Fischer&amp;diff=73601630&amp;oldid=73544783" rel="nofollow">the evidence supporting this edit</a>. Not every vocal critic of U.S. and Israeli foreign policy calls for genocide of American Jews; not every supporter of a Palestinian state wants Israel to be wiped from the map. Had Fischer stopped with his <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_x.html#Tensions" title="Malcolm x">"the chickens are coming home to roost"</a> remark--i.e., his opening reference to the BBC announcer's "what goes around comes around"--and urged reform of said foreign policies, the characterization might be fair. So I'm reverting while adding reference to Fischer's critique: kindly cite sources and context from the 9/11 interview to support alternative interpretations. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 18:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are any misquotations in the following. I would be happy to discuss a fair characterization of these statements:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Fuck the U.S., I want to see the U.S. wiped out."</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"It's time for the U.S. to eat the shit, to humble themselves, to withdraw their troops from around the world, to admit that they've been wrong, that's the only solution. Otherwise, the U.S. has to be destroyed."</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Death to President Bush! Death to the United States! Fuck the United States! Fuck the Jews!"</i> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Hallelujah, this is a wonderful day! Fuck the United States! Cry you crybabies, whine you bastards."</i> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>And here's the clincher:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"[...] I'm hoping for some kind of a <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Days_In_May_4388.html" title="Seven Days In May">Seven Days In May</a> scenario, where the country [</i>i.e., the United States<i>] will be taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders, and, you know, apologize to the Arabs, kill off all the Jews over there in the bandit state of Israel. I'm hoping for a totally new world."</i> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case, I would argue that "virulent" is unfortunately a justifiable characterization. RJF is not merely conducting a Chomskyan critique of 9/11 as jusitified blowback from the excesses of American imperialism, he's engaging in hate speech (and, unfortunately, self-hate speech). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 18:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Hatred speech"</span></h2>
<p>I consider terming Fischer´s rational and coherent, yet a bit hypomaniac, statements, as "hatred speech" is vague and obviously judgy from a non NPOV. I emphasized the meaning of his words, and then quoted them plainly, without criticism of his style. I don´t think the point he used profane language is important here. Again trying to debase him on aesthetical considerations seems non NPOV. <a href="../../../d/r/c/User%7EDrcaldev_d54c.html" title="User:Drcaldev">Drcaldev</a> 19:27, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
