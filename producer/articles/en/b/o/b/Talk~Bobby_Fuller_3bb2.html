<p>Removed this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many questions that still remain about the death of Bobby Fuller which happened on July 18th, 1966. Fuller was found in the front seat of his mom’s Oldsmobile beaten very badly, with many bruises on his chest, face and shoulders and also with a broken finger. He was covered in gasoline and gasoline was also found in his lungs. The death was first ruled a suicide by police, but the cause of death was later changed on his death certificate to accidental. However, it has been said by many doctors that it is impossible to kill yourself by drinking gasoline. It is not possible to keep enough of the gasoline down long enough to cause death. Many believe there was foul play involved, which is almost impossible not to suspect when looking at the evidence. Friends and family of Fuller had been searching the Los Angeles area for Fuller’s body and car all day, and mid afternoon the car showed up in the parking lot of the apartment building where Fuller lived. Friends said there was moisture under the exhaust pipe when they found the car, which leads them to believe that the car had recently been driven. Fuller’s mom was the first one to find him in the car, and she said and he was lying on the front seat of the car and the keys were in the ignition. The police report said that there were no keys in the car. There were many mistakes made by the police department which lead many to believe this death was also covered up by the police. For example, there was a gas can in the backseat of the car that was 1/3 full. The can was thrown away by police, because they did not consider it to be an important piece of evidence and the car was also not dusted for fingerprints. The police ruled that it was an “obvious suicide” at the site. There had been speculation that Fuller had attended an LSD party the night he died and died of an overdose, and the people at the party tried to make the death look like a suicide by covering him in gasoline, but that does not explain the bruises and dried blood that covered Fuller’s body. When the case appeared on Unsolved Mysteries, a woman who claimed to be at the LSD party called and said that Fuller never showed up. Fuller had been seeing a girl by the name of Melanie. Her ex-boyfriend was said to be very jealous and possibly tied to organized crime, the Mob. Melanie disappeared after Fuller’s death and had not been heard from again until Melanie called in after seeing the case on Unsolved Mysteries, however it is speculated that the woman who called was not really Melanie. Fuller’s parents hired a private investigator to look into the rumors of foul play pertaining to Fuller’s death, but the investigator was shot at a few days after being on the case and quit. The case is still closed and friends and family of Fuller say that when they ask to view the police report they are told many different things, such as the case is very old and they don’t keep records for that long or that the records were lost in a fire. But they have not been able to see the police reports.</p>
