<p>Is it really standard usage to put a space between a number and the percent sign?

<dd><i>As far as the space is concerned, both styles exist in Wikipedia. I picked one. It happens to be the ISO style. The style for units is to have a space. So it looks better with:</i>

<p>Please give something other than a canned response. I am asking a specific question now? Who, besides you, supports the use of a space between a number and a percent sign? Are you just making shit up? The percent sign is <b>not a unit of measurement</b>, it's a symbol for the division of a number by 100. Please provide some source for the use of a space or I will block you for a greater duration. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>13:06, Feb. 12, 2006</small></p>
<p>Also, regardless of whether using the space is acceptable, there is clearly no consensus that there is anything wrong with spelling out "percent", according to the MoS, which states that "7%" and "seven percent" are equally acceptable. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>13:08, Feb. 12, 2006</small></p>

<dd>The edits are not about a space. The edits are about changing '7 percent' and '7 per cent' into '7 %'. Let us be clear, I am not changing 'seven percent' to 'seven %'.</dd>

<dd>I do not want to argue with you about a space. That issue was debated at length and left permitting either. If you are interested in the topic, please look in the archives or raise it again in the MoS. If my preference is not your preference, that is fine by me. I can do either. I simply replaced the word with the symbol. The space is already there and I did not delete it. Do not get so angry with me. I can implement your preference, I really don't care.

<dd>According to the MoS (all hail it -.-) you should be changing "7 percent" to "7%" and "seven per cent" to "seven percent". Anything further is unnecessary. If two styles are equally acceptable, a bot-assisted crusade such as yours, solely to change an article from one style to the other is pure disruption. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>13:24, Feb. 12, 2006</small></dd>

<dd>Believe me, I wish that it did give a recommendation on the space but unfortunately it does not. In the absence of MoS guidance on the space, it is a personal preference issue.

I am also struggling to understand why you were threatened with being (and, it would seem, actually were) blocked for something so trivial.</dd>

<p>Hi, could you provide more detailed edit summaries? "AWB assisted cleanup" is not a helpful edit summary for what you appear to be doing. Consider "Change 'per cent' to '%'". <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 20:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback. The edit summary said "Doing X. Y" and did indeed do either X, or Y, or both. It had not occured to me that anyone might be unhappy about that, but I accept that you are. Given the characterisation of that as a "bad", I will consider more use terms such as "or", "possibly" and "perhaps also". I hope that you will find that more acceptable. As far as the actual edits are concerned, that is an error that should not happen in future. Thanks for the feedback.

<dd>No it didn't. It removed an underscore from a link *of* an underscore, and didn't fix any "per cent" into "percent" or anything like that. It also removed line breaks from under section headings. I really think you should stop making these edits. Given the number of reported errors here compared with the number of edits you have done, it is not hard to imagine that there are other mistaken edits you have made which have introduced similar errors.

<li>You complain about the removal of line breaks. I do not understand the complaint so I cannot answer it.</li>

<dd>Edits were either 'cleanup' or related to percent, or both. It seems that complaints relate to those characterised as 'cleanup'. I am no longer doing those.

<dd>The edit summary was this: "AWB assisted clean up. 'x percent' -&gt; 'x %' in accordance with Manual of Style". The edit did not change "x percent" to "x %". This is why it is a bad edit summary. The edits you performed that article where completely unnecessary. You didn't fix anything, in fact you broke something.

<dd>So why did you include "'x percent' -&gt; 'x %' in accordance with Manual of Style" in the edit summary if you <b>weren't actually doing that</b>? The entire point of an edit summary is that it is a summary of what you edited (obviously). Putting inaccurate edit summaries in is very unhelpful. Don't use "or", "possibly" or "perhaps also". Make the edit summary reflect only what you have done in that particular edit. This seems remarkably obvious to me and I am surprised I am having to explain it. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 14:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Me again. I'd say keep up with the blank lines—it saves Wikipedia two bytes of storage per line (unless its the only edit made), but what's with the space in front of the percentage sign? Shouldn't it be 33% as opposed to 33 %?—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (ërinacëus amurënsis)</a> 23:15, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the space is concerned, both styles exist in Wikipedia. I picked one. It happens to be the ISO style. The style for units is to have a space. So it looks better with:
<ul>
<li>12 kg</li>
<li>10 m</li>
<li>24 V</li>
<li>60 W</li>
<li>25 %</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But it isn't a big deal for me. If you don't like it, change it to the way you want. You can bet if I had chosen the other style, somebody else would have raised the opposite point. We discussed this very point in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a> (probably around April) but came to no conclusion other than to leave it unresolved.

<dd>I am aware of your preference for this. I think I agree with you although I am not 100% sure and do not always give it top priority. In the case of software assisted (e.g. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser</a>) edits, I should probably have considered it. I was fixing problems with 'percent' i.e. inconsistent spelling (either 'per cent' or 'percent') and mismatch with guidance ('7 percent' should be '7 %'). I am not fixing that problem right now (I am back on date overlinking) but there are still plenty to fix. If you want to deal with them yourself (with or without AutoWikiBrowser), I would welcome it, it is a simple matter to include the "&amp;nbsp;". <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 17:50, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
