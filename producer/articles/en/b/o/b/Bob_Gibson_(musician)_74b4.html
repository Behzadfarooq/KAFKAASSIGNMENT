He was known for playing both the banjo and the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_string_guitar.html" title="Twelve string guitar">12-string guitar</a>. He introduced <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Baez_b724.html" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a> at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_Folk_Festival_afb3.html" title="Newport Folk Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a> of 1959.

<p>Bob Gibson was born on November 16, 1931 in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in various communities outside New York City - <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tuckahoe%2C_Westchester_County%2C_New_York_a659.html" title="Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York">Tuckahoe</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorktown_Heights%2C_New_York_a615.html" title="Yorktown Heights, New York">Yorktown Heights</a>, and Tompkins Corners. His early interest in music was, primarily, vocal. He left high school in his senior year and hitchhiked around the country. Eventually returning to New York City, Gibson became a partner in a firm that taught speed reading where he was responsible for sales and public relations. In 1953 Gibson met Pete Seeger. Gibson was so impressed with Seeger and his music, he "took the money I had set aside for rent" and bought a banjo (Gibson, page 3). After deciding to leave his job, Gibson taught himself to play the banjo over the next year, became immersed in the study of folk music, and became a performer at the age of 22. After performing briefly in New York City, he traveled to Miami, Florida performing in various clubs throughout the city. After Miami, Gibson performed from Cleveland to New York and was eventually hired at the Green Door in Michigan City, Indiana (50 miles east of Chicago). He then found an agent in Chicago and was booked into the Offbeat Room in Chicago.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gibson_%28musician%29_74b4.html" title="Edit section: The glory years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The glory years</span></h2>
<p>Gibson first met <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Grossman_7d7e.html" title="Albert Grossman">Albert Grossman</a> while performing at the Offbeat Room. Grossman had an idea for a folk club on the near north side of Chicago and, in 1956, opened The Gate of Horn. In the third week after opening, Grossman booked Gibson into the club. He began a continuous performing streak that lasted eleven months. Beginning as an opener for many of the acts, by the end of his eleven-month stay, Gibson was the headliner, closing for everyone.</p>
<p>Grossman had a knack for finding talent. This list of performers he booked into The Gate of Horn included <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_White_28f6.html" title="Josh White">Josh White</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Yarborough_d232.html" title="Glenn Yarborough">Glenn Yarborough</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/e/Odetta.html" title="Odetta">Odetta</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Baez_b724.html" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a> (which led to his inviting the then unknown performer to join him at the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_Folk_Festival_afb3.html" title="Newport Folk Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a>), <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Camp_3f91.html" title="Hamilton Camp">Hamilton Camp</a>, and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Collins_b7d3.html" title="Judy Collins">Judy Collins</a>. Grossman had "scouted" Bob Gibson for his club, but he could not imagine the headline act that Gibson would become. Bob Gibson was on his way to becoming a legend in Chicago in the early 1960s, helped along by a talented singer and songwriter, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Camp_3f91.html" title="Hamilton Camp">Hamilton Camp</a>. In 1961 their debut album was released on Electra Records, <i>Gibson and Camp at the Gate of Horn</i>. A watershed album, it influenced singers from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> to <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lightfoot_f3f9.html" title="Gordon Lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a> to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Denver_1bf9.html" title="John Denver">John Denver</a>.</p>

<p>Bob was an abuser of alcohol even in his teens. He had also experimented with drugs. By the time of his rise to success in Chicago he was a heavy user of <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphetamine.html" title="Amphetamine">speed</a>. "Drugs were never recreational for me. My use of them from the beginning was abusive ... " (Gibson, page 90). His drug use escalated when he discovered heroin. Gibson was in and out of jails in Canada, Chicago, and Cleveland for various drug-related charges. In the mid 1960s, Gibson began a three-year period of complete isolation where drugs were his only priority. From 1969 to 1978, Gibson tried repeatedly to restart his career, but his addictions made it impossible. During this period he tried often, but unsuccessfully, to get sober. He knew that he needed structure, but, at first, disavowing God he rejected <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholics_Anonymous_e1b5.html" title="Alcoholics Anonymous">AA</a>. In 1978 he attended an AA meeting in Cleveland and learned to live a life without alcohol and drugs.</p>

<p>In 1978 Gibson gave up drugs for good. A musical comeback, however, was not to be. In the early 1960s, Bob Gibson was at the center of the folk music universe, influencing everyone around him. By 1978 there was an audience that was an entirely new generation. Although many remembered Gibson, he was never again to capture the mass public appeal of his early 1960s period. He did embark, however, on one of the most productive periods of his career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gibson_%28musician%29_74b4.html" title="Edit section: Illness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Illness</span></h2>
<p>Starting about 1990, Gibson started to experience the symptoms of an illness that would not be diagnosed until three years later. Loss of balance and falling was one of Gibson's first symptoms. Later, his vision and then his voice were affected. Living near Mendocino, doctors were unsuccessful in diagnosing or treating him. In 1994 he entered the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayo_Clinic_6cea.html" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida where he was diagnosed with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_supranuclear_palsy.html" title="Progressive supranuclear palsy">Progressive supranuclear palsy</a> (PSP). With only 20,000 people in the United States with PSP, there was very little research money available for study of the disease. Bob moved from "my favorite place to live (Gibson, page 211)" to Portland, Oregon where some research was being done on PSP.</p>
<p>Failing from his illness, Gibson invited many of his friends to a farewell concert on September 20, 1996 in Chicago. His letter to his friends included this paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This may be the last chance I have to see many of you. I am finding it increasingly difficult to do the simplest things and traveling is really a challenge. I won't be able to play and sing with you, bit I'm really looking forward to being an audience of one! (Gibson, page 239)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concert was held. Bob tired early, struggled to rise and say goodnight, and received a standing ovation. One week later, on September 28, 1996 Gibson died in Portland, Oregon.</p>
