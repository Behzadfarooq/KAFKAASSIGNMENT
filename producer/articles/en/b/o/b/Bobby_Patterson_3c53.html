<p>After a failure of his first marriage, Hiram Patterson marries another woman. Bobby is the result of this. Like the first marriage, this marriage does not last long either.</p>
<p>Years later, OurWorld became a successful business. Hiram is one of the richest men in the world. He expects Bobby to inherit his wealth and continue his success when he dies. Bobby seemingly agrees with Hiram's idea whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>Bobby then meets Kate Manzoni. He then befriends Kate and learns what human life is truly about. After spending time with her, Bobby seems to question the life he was living throughout his whole life.</p>
<p>Kate notices Bobby's seemingly passive and emotionless personality. He then reveals that he has a brain implant in order to control his <a href="../../../a/d/h/ADHD_4f6a.html" title="ADHD">ADHD</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epilepsy</a>. However, after analyzing the implant, Kate tells him that he has no mental illnesses and that the brain implant was actually used to remove Bobby's emotions. Bobby is shocked at this news.</p>
<p>After the deactivation of the implant, Bobby tries to adjust to the life of a person. He is confused by the mysterious world he inhabits. He then visits his birthmother and his half-sister, Mary. Bobby is shocked by their lowly status albeit he tries to bond with them.</p>
<p>Bobby finds out that after Kate has been found guilty of spying, she is scheduled to receive the same fate he previously had. He tries to rescue Kate even with the daunting challenge of all-seeing gaze of the WormCam. It is made easier to escape when Mary appears with a device called the SmartShroud. It makes the user invisible. By using the SmartShroud, Bobby, Kate, and Mary escape.</p>
<p>They go to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in order to hide with the Refugees. They are successful and adjust their new lifestyle, but Mary joins a supermind called the Joined. Bobby then leaves and visits David. Unfortunately, Hiram manages to find Bobby along with Kate and Mary. He is then blackmailed by Hiram into joining back with him.</p>
<p>Bobby finds Kate and breaks her out. On their way out, Kate reveals that Bobby is a clone of Hiram. Hiram tries to stop them and Mae Wilson shot at Bobby. He reveals to Bobby that he planned to build a dynasty through him and that he has no choice but to accept. Bobby then gains his independence by saying to Hiram that he may have his <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, but he is his own person. Hiram is then murdered after Mae Wilson kills him and herself in a wormhole. Hiram's last command is save Bobby.</p>
<p>Bobby marries Kate and unfortunately, Kate dies of cancer thirty-five years later. Forty years after Hiram's death, Bobby meets up with David. They use the WormCam to explore the beginning of Earth's life. They are shocked to find out that beings called Sisyphans placed the life that scientists know on Earth in order to avoid extinction. After hearing David's sermon on life, Bobby is about to make a comment on Hiram's old saying, but he dies before he can finish.</p>
<p>Bobby is then resurrected through the usage of cloning and mind downloading. He is welcomed into the distant future by a strange woman. She welcomes him into the seemingly utopian society and expresses her leader's plan for the future. Bobby then follows the woman to see Kate and the new world.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Patterson_3c53.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Bobby starts out as a naive, brash individual. After meeting Kate and David and the deactivation of his implant, Bobby gains insight into what it means to be human. Kate and David teach Bobby about human nature. Along the way, he meets up with different individuals and learns from them as well. These teachings eventually leads to Bobby's rebellion against Hiram.</p>
<p>He also starts as dependent on his father. After realizing what it means to be human, Bobby becomes more independent. This loss of control upsets Hiram. Even with the discovery of being a clone, Bobby isn't swayed. He finally denounces the control Hiram has on him by stating that he is who he wants to be no matter what.</p>
