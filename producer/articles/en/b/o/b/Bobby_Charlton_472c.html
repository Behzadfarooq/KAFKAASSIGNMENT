He is arguably the greatest English footballer to have lived. He played almost all of his club football at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a>, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midfield.html" title="Midfield">midfield</a> and his ferocious long-range shot.</p>
<p>He began to play for United's first team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_air_disaster.html" title="Munich air disaster">Munich air disaster</a> of 1958. After helping United to win the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_league.html" title="Football league">football league</a> in 1965, he won a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_f56f.html" title="Football World Cup">World Cup</a> medal with <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> in 1966 and another football league title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Cup_44bd.html" title="European Cup">European Cup</a>, scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He had scored more goals for England and United than any other player. He also made more appearances for Manchester United than any other player, records which are still standing at the end of 2006. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.</p>
<p>He left Manchester United in 1973, becoming player-manager of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston_North_End_F.C._4a42.html" title="Preston North End F.C.">Preston North End</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, but decided management was not for him and left after one season.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Charlton_472c.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>One of his uncles, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_United_F.C._2974.html" title="Newcastle United F.C.">Newcastle United</a> centre forward <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Milburn_ae5c.html" title="Jackie Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a>, was a professional footballer, but it was Charlton's mother Cissie who coached him at first. His elder brother, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Charlton_0336.html" title="Jack Charlton">Jack</a>, went to work as a miner and applied to join the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> before also becoming a footballer with Leeds United.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, Grammar School pupil Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> chief scout <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Armstrong_e53d.html" title="Joe Armstrong">Joe Armstrong</a>. Charlton went on to play for England schoolboys, and despite offers that followed from several other clubs, the 15-year old signed with United. Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apprentice.html" title="Apprentice">apprenticeship</a> as an engineer; however he went on to turn professional in October 1954.</p>
<p>Charlton became one of the famed <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busby_Babes_7a94.html" title="Busby Babes">Busby Babes</a>, the collection of precociously talented footballers who emerged through the system at <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Trafford_%28football%29_4dfd.html" title="Old Trafford (football)">Old Trafford</a> in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Athletic_F.C._ce31.html" title="Charlton Athletic F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Service_0445.html" title="National Service">National Service</a> in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for United at the weekend. Also doing his <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a> service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team-mate <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_Edwards_5f63.html" title="Duncan Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a>.</p>

<p>Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season. They won the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html" title="The Football League">League championship</a> but were denied the 20th century's first "double" when they controversially lost the 1957 <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> final to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Aston_Villa_F.C._7190.html" title="Aston Villa F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game which saw United goalkeeper <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Wood_0601.html" title="Ray Wood">Ray Wood</a> carried off with a broken <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheek.html" title="Cheek">cheekbone</a> after a clash with Villa centre forward <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_McParland_247e.html" title="Peter McParland">Peter McParland</a>. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substitute_%28soccer%29.html" title="Substitute (soccer)">substitutes</a>, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was team-mate <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Blanchflower_e789.html" title="Jackie Blanchflower">Jackie Blanchflower</a> who ended up between the posts.</p>
<p>Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to fully embrace the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Cup_44bd.html" title="European Cup">European Cup</a>, reaching the semi finals where they lost to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Madrid_7daf.html" title="Real Madrid">Real Madrid</a>. Previously, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_Association_b0ba.html" title="The Football Association">the Football Association</a> had scorned the competition but United's progress in the competition earned a great deal of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">continental</a> respect. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Star_Belgrade_a73a.html" title="Red Star Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>. In the first leg at home, United won 2-1. The return in <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3-0 ahead although the hosts came back to earn a 3-3 draw. However, United maintained their <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_score.html" title="Aggregate score">aggregate</a> lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolves</a> at the weekend.</p>

<p>The aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zemun.html" title="Zemun">Zemun Airport</a> needed to stop in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a> to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewardess.html" title="Stewardess">stewardess</a> to dismount again while a minor technical error was fixed.</p>
<p>Back in the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport_terminal.html" title="Airport terminal">airport terminal</a> for barely ten minutes, the call to reconvene on the plane came and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and team-mate <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Viollet_b432.html" title="Dennis Viollet">Dennis Viollet</a> swapped places with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Taylor_5307.html" title="Tommy Taylor">Tommy Taylor</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pegg_669f.html" title="David Pegg">David Pegg</a>, who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane. This would prove a fatal decision for Taylor and Pegg.</p>
<p>The plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.</p>
<p>Charlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Gregg_7d03.html" title="Harry Gregg">Harry Gregg</a> (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trousers.html" title="Trousers">trouser</a> waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.</p>
<p>Charlton suffered cuts to his head and severe <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock.html" title="Shock">shock</a> and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his team-mates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Byrne_71e9.html" title="Roger Byrne">Roger Byrne</a> was also killed, along with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Jones_%28footballer%29_5c13.html" title="Mark Jones (footballer)">Mark Jones</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Whelan_6524.html" title="Liam Whelan">Billy Whelan</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Colman_1b88.html" title="Eddie Colman">Eddie Colman</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Bent_bfd4.html" title="Geoff Bent">Geoff Bent</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_Edwards_5f63.html" title="Duncan Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a> died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice.html" title="Ice">ice</a> on the wings was blamed, but another inquiry later declared that <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slush.html" title="Slush">slush</a> on the runway had made the plane's facility to achieve a safe take-off almost impossible.</p>
<p>Charlton was the first survivor to leave hospital. He arrived back in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">February 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_Milan_4a86.html" title="AC Milan">AC Milan</a> in the semi finals to a 5-2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. His words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_Lofthouse_7d1f.html" title="Nat Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> scored twice to give a professional <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C._f176.html" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> side a 2-0 win.</p>

<p>At the same time, Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> squad for a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Championship_55b6.html" title="British Home Championship">British Home Championship</a> game against <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_national_football_team.html" title="Scotland national football team">Scotland</a> at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Park_6ad8.html" title="Hampden Park">Hampden Park</a>. It would be the start of a long, prolific, record-breaking and globally respected career for his country.</p>
<p>Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4-0, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Finney_854e.html" title="Tom Finney">Tom Finney</a>. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal_national_football_team.html" title="Portugal national football team">Portugal</a> 2-1 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> to play his third match against <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia_national_football_team.html" title="Yugoslavia national football team">Yugoslavia</a>. Unfortunately, England lost that game 5-0 and Charlton played poorly. He was selected for the squad which competed at the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1958_a0e9.html" title="Football World Cup 1958">1958 World Cup</a> in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, but didn't kick a ball, something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment, even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade.</p>
<p>Charlton began to settle back into his footballing life with Manchester United and England and enhanced his reputation as a scorer of great goals as well as a great goalscorer - rarely is a player regarded as both. In 1959 he scored a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat-trick.html" title="Hat-trick">hat-trick</a> as England demolished the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team_7e9f.html" title="United States men's national soccer team">USA</a> 8-1; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8-0 thrashing of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_national_football_team.html" title="Mexico national football team">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>He played in qualifiers for the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1962_de44.html" title="Football World Cup 1962">1962 World Cup</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> against <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg_national_football_team.html" title="Luxembourg national football team">Luxembourg</a> and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3-1 group win over <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina_national_football_team.html" title="Argentina national football team">Argentina</a> was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil_national_football_team.html" title="Brazil national football team">Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>Further success with Manchester United finally came when they beat <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester_City_F.C._afb0.html" title="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a> 3-1 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. In between, there was the pressing matter for Charlton of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1966_c38c.html" title="Football World Cup 1966">1966 World Cup</a> for which England, as hosts, had not needed to qualify. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of <i><a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Writers%27_Association_0f2e.html" title="Football Writers' Association">Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Footballer_of_the_Year_efd9.html" title="European Footballer of the Year">European Footballer Of The Year</a></i> into the competition.</p>
<p>By now, England were coached by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf_Ramsey_c1f7.html" title="Alf Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee.html" title="Committee">committee</a>-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection - it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form. Luckily for Charlton, he had all three.</p>
<p>Charlton had remained the attacking midfield player around whom Ramsey had intended to build his team. He was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Charlton_472c.html" title="Edit section: The success of 1966">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The success of 1966</span></h2>
<p>The opening game of the tournament was Charlton's 69th for his country - a goalless draw with <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguay_national_football_team.html" title="Uruguay national football team">Uruguay</a>. England swept aside this minor hiccup to dispose of Mexico in the next game, with Charlton scoring one of the most famous goals of his career.</p>
<p>Picking up the ball in the centre circle of the Wembley pitch, Charlton issued a Mexican challenger with a body swerve which sent his opponent the wrong way and opened up a sizeable gap ahead of him. His reputation for long-range finishes now the stuff of legend, everyone braced themselves for a shot - and Charlton memorably obliged. It arrowed straight into the top corner of the Mexico net, finally opening England's goal account in the tournament and setting them up for a 2-0 win. This was followed by an identical scoreline against <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_national_football_team.html" title="France national football team">France</a> and England were in the last eight.</p>
<p>There they overcame a thuggish Argentina side with a slender 1-0 win - the game was the only one in which Charlton received a caution - and Portugal awaited in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games, for both himself and those for whom he played.</p>
<p>Charlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Hunt_10cd.html" title="Roger Hunt">Roger Hunt</a> had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; the second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Hurst_14cc.html" title="Geoff Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a>. Charlton and Hunt were now England's equal-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany_national_football_team.html" title="Germany national football team">West Germany</a> was to come.</p>
<p>Though the game had drama, great team performances and some breathtaking individual displays, it actually turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days. He had a young <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Beckenbauer_9676.html" title="Franz Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> marking him and vice versa, and the two ultimately seemed to cancel each other out. However, the team did what was required and won 4-2 (although controversy still exists as to whether the 3rd goal ever crossed the line), with Hurst's hat-trick entering football folklore (and overtaking Charlton and Hunt as England's top marksman). Charlton was playing alongside his brother Jack and the two openly embraced and wept as the greatness of their achievement sank in.</p>

<p>Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team_a5ef.html" title="Northern Ireland national football team">Northern Ireland</a>; 2 <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cap_%28football%29.html" title="Cap (football)">caps</a> later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Wright_f168.html" title="Billy Wright">Billy Wright</a>, who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.</p>
<p>In 1968, Manchester United reached the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Cup_44bd.html" title="European Cup">European Cup</a> final, ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decade.html" title="Decade">decade</a>, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4-1 win after extra time against <a href="../../../s/l/_/SL_Benfica_5c9e.html" title="SL Benfica">Benfica</a> and, as United captain, lifted the trophy. Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden_national_football_team.html" title="Sweden national football team">Sweden</a>, breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Greaves_4cac.html" title="Jimmy Greaves">Jimmy Greaves</a>. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_European_Football_Championship_d16f.html" title="1968 European Football Championship">1968 European Championships</a> where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a>; England defeated the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_national_football_team_8014.html" title="USSR national football team">Soviet Union</a> 2-0 in the third place match.</p>
<p>In 1969, Charlton was awarded the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">OBE</a> for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">21 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country - his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4-0 win over <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia_national_football_team.html" title="Colombia national football team">Colombia</a> during a warm-up tour for the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1970_4910.html" title="Football World Cup 1970">1970 World Cup</a>, designed to get the players adapted to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altitude.html" title="Altitude">altitude</a> conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first - and still, to date, only - England player to feature in four World Cup squads.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Charlton_472c.html" title="Edit section: World Cup 1970 and retirement from playing football">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World Cup 1970 and retirement from playing football</span></h2>
<p>England began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Ball_%28footballer%29_68c1.html" title="Alan Ball (footballer)">Alan Ball</a> in the final game of the group against <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia_national_football_team.html" title="Czechoslovakia national football team">Czechoslovakia</a>. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.</p>
<p>England duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed <a href="../../../b/e/c/Beckenbauer.html" title="Beckenbauer">Beckenbauer</a>'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2-0 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Bell_33b2.html" title="Colin Bell">Colin Bell</a> who further tested the German keeper <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maier.html" title="Maier">Maier</a> and also provided a great cross for <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Hurst_14cc.html" title="Geoff Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a> who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice - a back header from <a href="../../../u/w/e/Uwe_Seeler_c7aa.html" title="Uwe Seeler">Uwe Seeler</a> made it 2-2 after which <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerd_M%C3%BCller_b6a1.html" title="Gerd Müller">Gerd Müller</a>'s goal finished England off. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.</p>
<p>Despite populist opinion the substitution did not change the game as <a href="../../../b/e/c/Beckenbauer.html" title="Beckenbauer">Beckenbauer</a> had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary. His caps record lasted until 1973 when <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Moore_909b.html" title="Bobby Moore">Bobby Moore</a> overtook him, and Charlton currently lies third in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Shilton_a06a.html" title="Peter Shilton">Peter Shilton</a>, whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. The goals record still stands, with <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Lineker_6cdc.html" title="Gary Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> the only player subsequently to threaten it, with a total of 48 goals for England.</p>
<p>Manchester United were in real difficulties in the early 1970s, with the team often fighting relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Best_68ca.html" title="George Best">George Best</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Law_eddd.html" title="Denis Law">Denis Law</a>, and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match, saying that "to do so would be hypocritical".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the 1972-73 season, having scored and 247 goals and set a club record of 752 appearances, a record which still stood as of 2006. His last game was against <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_F.C._c6c0.html" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamford_Bridge_38bf.html" title="Stamford Bridge">Stamford Bridge</a>, and before the game the BBC cameras for <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Of_The_Day_17aa.html" title="Match Of The Day">Match Of The Day</a></i> captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarette</a> case.</p>

<p>Charlton became the player-manager of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston_North_End_F.C._4a42.html" title="Preston North End F.C.">Preston North End</a> in 1973, taking United and England team-mate <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobby_Stiles_e405.html" title="Nobby Stiles">Nobby Stiles</a> with him as player-coach, but his first season was not a success and he left at the end of it. However, he was awarded the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> that year and began a casual association with the BBC for punditry on matches which continued for many years. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> he scored 18 goals in 31 appearances for <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford_United_87d1.html" title="Waterford United">Waterford United</a>.</p>
<p>He then joined <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigan_Athletic_F.C._9582.html" title="Wigan Athletic F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> as a director, and was briefly caretaker manager there.

In 1984, he was invited to become member of the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_directors.html" title="Board of directors">board of directors</a> at Manchester United, partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a "name" on the board after the resignation of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Busby_8995.html" title="Matt Busby">Sir Matt Busby</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> He remains a director of Manchester United as of 2007.</p>

<p>Charlton began to lose his hair in the early 1960s and for a while refused to go bald gracefully, sporting a style of stranded, isolated hairs which would often flop around when he was running before he would tug them back over his head.
