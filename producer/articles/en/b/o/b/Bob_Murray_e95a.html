<p><b>Bob Murray CBE</b> (born <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">3 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consett.html" title="Consett">Consett</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Durham_194a.html" title="County Durham">County Durham</a>); an <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accountant.html" title="Accountant">accountant</a> by trade, he made his fortune by selling kitchens. He became chairman of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland_AFC_17d3.html" title="Sunderland AFC">Sunderland AFC</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, replacing the motor dealer <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cowie_3f30.html" title="Tom Cowie">Tom Cowie</a>, who had been hugely unpopular with the fans.</p>
<p>Murray's first season as chairman ended with the dismissal of manager Lawrie McMenemy (who at the time was the highest-paid manager in the Football League) and the club's relegation to the Third Division for the first time in their history. But a quick revival saw Sunderland reach the First Division in 1990, only to go down after one season. They did not return to the top flight until 1996, by which time it had been renamed the Premiership. Murray's funds went towards the new Stadium of Light, which opened in 1997 and was the biggest new club stadium in English football since Manchester City had moved into Maine Road more than 70 years earlier. In 2000, Sunderland finished seventh in the Premiership and repeated this position a year later, but Murray became unpopular when Sunderland were relegated in 2003 with a record low of 19 points as well as debts of nearly £30million. Promotion was gained two years later but Murray was soon vilified again as Sunderland endured a terrible season back in the Premiership.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Murray was involved in an incident with a fan whilst enjoying a meal with his wife and the family of then manager <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_McCarthy_15d2.html" title="Mick McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a>, where he was allegedly attacked following a row. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11th.html" title="March 11th">March 11th</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, following yet another defeat for the team, this time a 1-0 loss to <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigan_Athletic_F.C._9582.html" title="Wigan Athletic F.C.">Wigan</a>, a group of around 1000 supporters gathered outside the main entrance of the club's stadium to protest against Murray's reign, with many calling for him to either resign or sell the club. Murray faced yet more criticism following the 1-0 defeat to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C._07df.html" title="Blackburn Rovers F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, when a tannoy announcement was made during the game telling fans the Murray gates and surrounding areas, the scenes of the last protest, would be closed off, preventing fans from demonstrating. Never the less, a further group of around 1000 supporters made there way around to the gates, leading to ugly scenes between protesters and the police. It was later announced that it was the decision of the police to block access to the gates, although <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumbria_Police_a512.html" title="Northumbria Police">Northumbria Police</a> claim a joint decision was made between themselves and the club.</p>
<p>However, Sunderland had progressed well during the final 11 seasons of Murray's ownership. They never finished below third place in the league's second tier; whereas the club had finished below this position 7 times in Murray's first 9 seasons as chairman.</p>

<p>Murray had, on numerous occasions stated he was willing to sell his shares in the club if an investor showed an interest. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, rumours were confirmed that former player and Sunderland AFC legend <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niall_Quinn_3cb0.html" title="Niall Quinn">Niall Quinn</a> was preparing to make an offer for the club, backed by a consortium of Irish businessmen. In order to pave the way for the success of this new deal Murray resigned as Sunderland chairman, allowing the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumaville_Consortium_4fde.html" title="Drumaville Consortium">Drumaville Consortium</a> takeover to occur more easily, although he remained on the board in the interim.</p>
<p>By 28th June 2006 Bob Murray had called a press conference at which he revealed that SAFC would be sold to Quinn's Consortium for £10 million<a href="http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=9876" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=9876" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Murray will personally received £5.7 million of the total, although he has stated that the extensive negotiations were in order to ensure the bid was in the interests of the club and not, as speculated by the press, for his own financial gain. This assertion was somewhat supported by the relatively low price at which he allowed his controlling stake to be purchased for. On 3rd July 2006 the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumaville_Consortium_4fde.html" title="Drumaville Consortium">Drumaville Consortium</a> bid for SAFC was officially confirmed and the offer of £10 million was made. The bid was successful and it ushered in a new era of management with Quinn having the unusual dual roles of both club Chairman and Manager.<a href="http://www.safc.com/club/?page_id=2856" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.safc.com/club/?page_id=2856" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
