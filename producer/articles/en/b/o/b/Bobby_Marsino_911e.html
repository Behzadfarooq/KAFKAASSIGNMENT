Bobby Marsino (2004)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Bobby Marsino</b> (born <b>Charles Robert Cassen</b>) was a fictional character in the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Young_and_the_Restless_e3e4.html" title="The Young and the Restless">The Young and the Restless</a></i>. <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">Actor</a> John Enos III played the role from <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2003.html" title="April 2003">April 2003</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2005.html" title="August 2005">August 2005</a>. <a name="Character" id="Character"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Marsino_911e.html" title="Edit section: Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, rich girl <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany_Hodges_c836.html" title="Brittany Hodges">Brittany Hodges</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauren_Woodland_60a4.html" title="Lauren Woodland">Lauren Woodland</a>), bored with college and her job at the Jabot Boutique, and always dreaming of the spotlight, was enticed by Bobby to sing at his club, Marsino's. She was shocked to discover it was a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strip_club.html" title="Strip club">strip club</a>. She took the job on the condition that she would only sing, not strip, but eventually agreed to strip anyway. When her father, Frederick (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Martin_930f.html" title="John H. Martin">John H. Martin</a>), learned of his daughter's new career, Bobby threw him out of the club for making a scene.</p>
<p>Frederick gave up on convincing Brittany to quit stripping, and Brittany's boyfriend Raul (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lago_7af6.html" title="David Lago">David Lago</a>) helped Frederick pull a setup to get caught drinking underage at the club to shut it down. During his hiatus from running the club, Bobby frequented the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa_City_5e2b.html" title="Genoa City">Genoa City</a> Athletic Club and made friends with <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Abbott_fcd2.html" title="Jill Abbott">Jill Abbott</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jess_Walton_d1eb.html" title="Jess Walton">Jess Walton</a>). Semi-drunk and lonely, she invited him back to her estate. Bobby had a drink with her there, but rebuffed her advances. They continued to meet occasionally as friends.</p>
<p>Bobby soon fell for the much younger Brittany, who was very vulnerable with all of her friends and family being against her new life. Marsino's re-opened, but Brittany was hesitant to return, so Bobby promised to hook her up with someone who could help her singing career. Meanwhile, Bobby's boss Sal Staley and the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_boss.html" title="Crime boss">mob boss</a> Bertolli Lewis, were looking for revenge on her father Fredrick for getting the club in trouble with the law. Sal approached Bobby's partner Angelo (Angelo Tiffe), who used to be a <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitman.html" title="Hitman">hitman</a> in the mob, to help. Not long afterward, Brittany was electrocuted by the stripper pole during her act and severely burned the entire right side of her face. Bobby and Raul stayed at her side throughout her recovery, but she was told that she would be scarred for life. When Brittany recovered and began falling for Bobby, Raul vowed to stick by her until he found a remedy for her scar. After encouraging her to return to the stage just to sing, Bobby turned his strip joint into a Cabaret called Marilyn's (after Brittany's stage name), just for Brittany. This angered the mob boss, Mr. Lewis, so Sal and his thugs cornered Bobby and Brittany in the club, ready to kill Brittany to teach him a lesson. But Bobby was wearing a wire and the police hauled them off to jail after Bobby got them to admit to several crimes, including the electrocution of Brittany and a couple of murders.</p>
<p>Bobby, now free of the mob, decided to "go legit" by turning Marsino's Strip Club into Marilyn's Cabaret, headlined by singer Brittany (aka "Marylin"). Unfortunately he didn't have the cash to carry it off so he began doing strip nights as well, and brought in <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikki_Newman_5563.html" title="Nikki Newman">Nikki Newman</a> (aka "Nicole") (<a href="../../../m/e/l/Melody_Thomas_Scott_2b9f.html" title="Melody Thomas Scott">Melody Thomas Scott</a>) as a consultant and <a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_92a5.html" title="MC">MC</a> to give it class. Brittany finally gave in to Bobby, told him that she loved him too, and they became lovers. Bobby proposed, Brittany's friends disapproved, and she didn't tell her parents the were engaged. Meanwhile the steadfast Raul found Brittany a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgeon.html" title="Plastic surgeon">plastic surgeon</a> to restore her burned face, she had the surgery, and awaited the result. But Raul, realizing that Brittany was committed to Bobby, bid everyone farewell, and left for <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> and his scholarship to Pemberton College. Brittany's surgery was successful, and the scar was hardly noticeable with the right makeup. Her parents were aghast to find out that she was marrying Bobby, but her mother Anita (<a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitzi_Kapture-Donahue_9ac4.html" title="Mitzi Kapture-Donahue">Mitzi Kapture-Donahue</a>) came through for her and reluctantly convinced Frederick at the last minute to attend their small wedding at the Chancellor estate. Fredrick walked Brittany down the aisle and slipped Bobby a check with a warning to take care of his little girl, "or else". The newlyweds spent a few days in the Genoa City Hotel Bridal Suite, then moved into the Newman ranch awaiting renovations on Bobby's condo.</p>
<p>Nikki soon began having strange flashes of childhood memories upon visiting the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreation_center.html" title="Recreation center">Rec Center</a> where her abusive father Nick (Scott Anthony Leet) used to work when it was a paint factory. The flashes escalated after the <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton.html" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a> of a child was found when the Rec Center broke ground for a <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">swimming pool</a>. With <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Williams_%28Y%26R%29_5406.html" title="Paul Williams (Y&amp;R)">Paul's</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Davidson_e99e.html" title="Doug Davidson">Doug Davidson</a>) investigative help, Nikki recalled herself and her best friend Joshua Cassen when they were both five years old, fighting over her father's gun, the gun going off, and Joshua being shot. Apparently Nick had buried the body behind the paint factory, and Nikki had <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_repression.html" title="Memory repression">repressed</a> the memory all these years until the skeleton was found. Nikki became obsessed with finding Joshua's younger brother, Charles "Charlie" Robert Cassen, once Paul told her the family had moved away to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, never knowing what happened to their missing son. One day Nikki told Bobby about this, not mentioning any names or the birthday party. Bobby said he understood. He explained that he was once a toddler named Charlie Cassen, whose 5 year old brother Joshua disappeared. His mother went into <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a> and became overly protective of her remaining son, and his father became an <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic.html" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a>. Both parents were killed in a car crash caused by his father driving drunk. Charlie was sent to live with his Uncle Al and Aunt Betty Marsino in upstate New York. He returned to Genoa City as Bobby Marsino, a teenager that his uncle didn't want around, and was a go-for at The Bayou (former name of Marsino's) during Nikki's stripper days. He used to sneak out from the back and admire her from afar. Overcome with guilt, Nikki was hesitant to tell Bobby about what really happened to his brother. Because Nikki was under so much stress about it, and Bobby was concerned about her behavior, Nikki's husband, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Newman_79f2.html" title="Victor Newman">Victor</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Braeden_053a.html" title="Eric Braeden">Eric Braeden</a>) finally told Bobby the truth. Bobby had it out with Nikki and left town for awhile, but he returned, and Nikki showed him the home movie of Joshua from her 5th birthday party. Brittany was not at all pleased with how this brought Nikki and Bobby together, and they moved out of the ranch into their own dingy apartment not long after she discovered she was pregnant. Running short on cash, and refusing to let Brittany work, Bobby took a job tending bar at the Genoa City Athletic Club. Due to the increasing debt caused by Brittany's hospitalization with pregnancy complications, he accepted $3,000 from the mob to hold a stash of diamonds. Brittany found out, so Bobby told the mob he would no longer do anything illegal, but will somehow repay them. They decided to name the baby Joshua after Bobby's deceased brother, and both were excited about the birth. They began receiving mysterious baby gifts that turned out to be from Vinny Trabuco (Joe Maruzzo) and Angelo as a threat to Bobby to return to the mob. Bobby went along with them, while trying to find evidence to expose them. To keep them away from Brittany and her unborn baby, they set it up to look like <a href="../../../j/2E/t/J.T._Hellstrom_a1ad.html" title="J.T. Hellstrom">J.T. Hellstrom</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/Thad_Luckinbill_6d7f.html" title="Thad Luckinbill">Thad Luckinbill</a>) was the father, and Bobby and Brittany staged a split. Nikki began nosing around and uncovered the plot, ending up getting kidnapped by Vinny's goon Luca (Marcus LaVoi). Paul, Victor, and Bobby rescued Nikki while J.T. took a distraught Brittany back to the Newman Ranch. Luckily, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie_Browning_602d.html" title="Mackenzie Browning">Mackenzie</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Kimsey_6fcb.html" title="Rachel Kimsey">Rachel Kimsey</a>) showed up as Brittany went into labor, and Mac delivered the two-month <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premature_baby.html" title="Premature baby">premature baby</a> Joshua. Vinny, Angelo, and his goon ended up in jail, Brittany and the baby in the hospital, and Bobby turned over his evidence on the mob and went into the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witness_protection_program.html" title="Witness protection program">witness protection program</a>, leaving Brittany and Joshua behind, and it was decided that they would join Bobby when it was safe. Months went by, and finally Brittany shared a short visit with a heavily-guarded Bobby. Not long afterward, she received word that Bobby had been killed by a <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_and_run.html" title="Hit and run">hit and run</a> driver. Brittany was devastated, and she and Joshua ended up moving to New York City with her parents, whom she had decided to give a second chance.</p>
