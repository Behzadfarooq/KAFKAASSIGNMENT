<dd>"All" vanity links?? That's <i>not</i> true: The second link was a clipping from the Ottawa Citizen. <i>You didn't even go to that link.</i> [<a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/poster.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greenwych.ca/poster.htm" rel="nofollow">News Clip</a>] But why not? Fink doesn't own the Ottawa Citizen!!</dd>
<dd>The first link was to prove Fink IS an artist -- and if you read the article you'd see his art work hangs in the local City Hall, some was published in the (Toronto) Globe and Mail, etc. The lists are long, and... uh..."encyclopedic."</dd>
<dd>The next link we sent allows you to download his music so you can know he really wrote some.</dd>
<dd>You see, we thought <i>verification</i> was the problem when you gave no reason on the template on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>But now I see "notability" is? Didn't you read the "credentials"? He served as juror for Nature Journal -- the world's leading science journal (UK) in case you don't know. Separately, the Konrad Lorenz institute in Vienna (theoretical biology) invited Fink (all expenses paid) to their conference at the Lorenz castle a while back -- he couldn't go, but our local paper quoted its director saying Fink was recognized as one of those "rare people who could give a comprehensive overview" on the origin of music. Those newsclips and docs and proof of his recognition as a leading figure in this field can be faxed or scanned and e-mailed to you. How many do you need?</dd>
<dd>He was written up in "Scientific American" magazine for his work on the Neanderthal Flute. Surely you've seen that magazine on every newstand on the planet? He received worldwide media attention for that amzing find -- See this page (if you're interested in having REAL evidence about his notability): [<a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/reviews.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greenwych.ca/reviews.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Some</i> of Fink's media reviews</a>]. He is as notable as <i>anyone else in his field.</i> If not, who would you say is more notable? Or is the field itself not notable enough either?</dd>
<dd>He was invited [by the International Council of Traditional Music -- google it] to write a response to one of the world's leading archaeologists [Francesco d'Errico], about the Neanderthal Flute, in the proceedings of a world conference on Archaeology, published by a noted German publisher of scholarly archaeology [<i>VML Verlag Marie Leidorf GmbH, Director: Dr. Bert Wiegel, Stellerloh 65, D-32369 Rahden/Westf. Germany</i>] under the title "Studies in Music Archaeology III" (2003) which is now in many leading world academic libraries.</dd>
<dd>Do you know anything about these publisheres and journals? Or the field of ancient music? And who is in it? If not, please find out before you trivialize them and Fink. How "notable" must he be? O.J. Simpson? Mozart? -- how do you judge?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article is a very nice vanity. Fink is not a notable person. You see, he has no real presence outside of his own web pages and precious few journal articles mentioning him in brief passing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is <i>so</i> factually untrue and unfair. His presence is world-wide, but granted, in a very narrow field -- music archaeology &amp; origins -- which will never be a household concern like war and peace or Iraq. Bob Fink's work is far better known than himself, because of the implications of the work for understanding Neanderthals and human origins. His webpages are simply *not* his only presence. Nor are his journal articles a "brief passing." ...This is not funny... Doesn't the truth interest you or are only your snap guesses going to count here?</dd>
<dd>Search google for the Greenwich Publisher's domain [which Fink now uses]; Search for "www.greenwych.ca" to find links to that name exisiting in hundreds, perhaps thousands of <i>other's</i> webpages. Search for his own former webpages "www.webster.sk.ca" [owned by link.ca, not Fink nor us] similarly, and you'll find many hundreds more -- all webpages we, nor Fink, own. Search for Fink himself in <i>other's</i> webpages. His recorded visitor counts far exceeds a million. We have records. See discussion at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Talk%7EMusical_acoustics_395a.html" title="Talk:Musical acoustics">Talk:Musical acoustics</a> for actual information about notability, 3rd party publication, credentials.</dd>
<dd>He gained notice with his contributions begining in 1996-1997 with his new work on the Origin of Music and the Neanderthal Flute, which we published because his notability was sufficient then to sell his books. Which are nearly sold out, in most major libraries already, as are several of his other books. <i>We can also fax you a list of the libraries or e-mail them to you, or copy them here.</i> Whereever. Are you interested or is your first guess to be your only inaccurate knowledge about this matter? Yes we like his work and think he deserves a place in <i>any</i> encyclopedia, especially for the diversity of his work.</dd>

<p>I disagree with Krukowski on one point: I think Bob Fink is notable. However, you are in breach of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, which says right at the top:</p>

<p>--Lagarvelho 19:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)--Lagarvelho 19:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)I think this article should be kept in Wikipedia. Why? Fink may not be a "well-known" person, but he <i>is</i> well known among musicians and musicologists, and has done important work in the field of the origins of music. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his conclusions about this subject is another question, and whatever his political views, they are more or less <i>irrelevant</i> to his views on the earliest music and instruments</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>With all due respect, I beg to differ. Fink's "contribution" to musicology is essentially a single paper which was never accepted in a peer-reviewed journal. This is not to say that peer-reviewed papers are the only valid way to distribute academic work, but anyone making "significant" contributions to an academic field could, justifiably, be expected to have a solid bibliography of journal articles under his belt. Compare Fink's work with respected 20th C. musicologists and theorists such as Babbitt, Lewin, Forte, Perle, Gilbert, Berry, Cook, or Lester (just to name a handful, hardly a comprehensive enumeration) and Fink is simply not in this league.</p>
<p>As has already been discussed, a computer program composing music in 1995 is also hardly significant. The earliest computer compostion dates to 1957 (and Lejaren Hiller currently only has a stub article!). By the mid-90s thousands of computer-based compositions had been realized around the world and a new computer program would be what I would expect as an undergraduate term project from any of the dozens of schools with active music-technology programs.</p>
<p>Fink's work as a political activist might, possibly, justify an article, or perhaps as archaeology. I would not presume to judge significance in either of those arenas. But including Fink in Wikipedia for his musical work is not justificable. Pcastine 17:43, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I can't claim to be very knowledgeable in the field of musicology, but based on his website and what else I could find with google, I have found nothing whatsoever to support the claim that he is well known among either musicians (a very broad category indeed, though) or musicologists. If he's really that notable, it should be easy for 65.255.255.* to prove this in a verifiable manner, instead of just telling us that he's well-known.</dd>

<li>Whoever posted them, they need the same fact-checking. For instance, I have just removed to the Talk page a completely untrue claim that "Fink [in 1995] was among the first to write a computer program that could compose melodies by itself".
<dl>
<dd>Really, Tearlach, you should try to quote in context. First of all, the key words in the quote which you claim is "completely untrue" are: "among the first" and "by itself." Also check the webpage announcing the program (which was nominated by <i>Discover</i> magazine for one of its contests in 1997 -- we have their letter). The <a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/serend4.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greenwych.ca/serend4.htm" rel="nofollow">webpage</a> says: "This MAY be the world's first..." and further down, Fink mentions <i>earlier programs than his</i> that combined snippets from existing music, but that his program works from scratch, and Fink is then quoted: "I THINK I was AMONG the first to develop such a program," that writes melodies <i>by itself</i>. Taking all comments together hardly qualifies your claim it is "completely untrue. Are you <i>looking for flaws and faults</i> rather than making serious arguments? I hope not. --<i>65.255.225.34 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.255.225.34_b1a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.255.225.34">contribs</a>)</i>

<dd>Oh, please, this is sheer sophistry. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_generated_music.html" title="Computer generated music">Computer generated music</a> - including computer-generated melodies - predates Bob Fink's <i>Serendipity</i> by getting on for 30 years. Even with reservations like "may" and "think" and quibbles about what "by itself" means, it's a claim that doesn't stand up. That you're trying to defend it is pretty good evidence of why this article needs independent editing. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 03:02, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "He is among the first" is different from "He IS the first." If one cannot see the clear difference in meaning, then one should check oneself into the "Home for Remedial English Comprehension."</dd>
<dd>The program in question composes melodies without using a database which contains already-composed music. That may seem "sophistry" to you, but I'm told it is significant to those who try to write such programs.</dd>
<dd>However, the offending item is removed, although I here ask someone to restore it in a form more clear to you.</dd>
<dd>We are always glad to learn new things and profit from our mistakes. So if you can <i>name the program</i> before Fink's that could write sensible melodies <i>without</i> using existing music samples, we'd be happy to know about it.&#160;:O) My cat and I eagerly await your verification. &gt;^--^&lt; (zzzz)</dd>

<p>OK, someone appears not to be aware of much history, so here we go. Depending on how you define "sensible melodies", choose from the following: Hiller, Illiac Suite (1957); Xenakis, any of the numerous ST- pieces (late 50s/early 60s); Cage/Hiller, HPSCHD (early 60's, nota bene: the synthesized materials, unlike the harpsichord parts, are not "based on existing musical materials"); any of Koenig's Projekt I/II/III compositions (late 60s and onwards); works by Roads, Pope, Cope, Dodge, Jerse, and (modestly) the undersigned abound (70s/80s). By 1978 Martin Gardner had even published instructions for an approach to computer-generated melodic material in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American (CCXXXVIII:4 pp. 16-31).</p>

<p>This is has gone on for long enough. Will the main editor of this page:</p>
<p>a) Sign in. It's obvious that edits from 65.255.225.* all come from the same source. It won't hurt you to log in.</p>
<p>b) Identify yourself. If you are either Bob Fink or Bob Fink's publisher or similar, you are in clear breach of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAutobiography_1f61.html" title="WP:Autobiography">WP:Autobiography</a> and should butt out from directly editing this and related articles. 86.145.94.202 02:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually that's not true.</dd>
<dd>1) Last we read, not signing in is a <i>permissable</i> option. (In any event, current edits are from Candace Norton, and the whole article -- "cleanup" -- was done by "Victoriagirl.")</dd>
<dd>2) In the reference to Wiki rules (autobiographical) it says:
<dl>
<dd><i>"However, in clear-cut cases, it is permissible to edit pages connected to yourself. So, you can revert vandalism; but of course it has to be simple, obvious vandalism, and not just a content dispute. Similarly, you should feel free to correct mistaken or out-of-date facts about yourself, such as marital status, current employer, place of birth, and so on. However, be prepared that if the fact has different interpretations, others will edit it.... Facts, retellings of events, and clarifications which you may wish to have added to an article about yourself must be verifiable."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The attempt at intimidation and bossiness (<i>"you should butt out"</i>) is abusive, untrue, and is itself a violation of the rules. If you wish to dispute something, propose it here in "Talk" rather than slaphappy pushing of the revert button on legitimate changes or additions (such as adding a fact-verification link, and the like). Also if you're writing about some other "related" article, put your views on THAT article's talk page, not this one.</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBob_Fink_56eb.html" title="Edit section: WATCHLIST">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">WATCHLIST</span></h3>
<p>I believe the request on watch list is by you, Rainwarrior. If so (Update: Removed my loss of temper pending further information if it was you who posted the request), here are the facts: I have not refused to abide by Wiki rules. 1. The page written in my Wiki bio was written by <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">User:Victoriagirl</a>, and one of us wrote in to her: "Good job" at the time, even though what was originally written there over a year ago (based on my publisher's webpage bios --as we didn't know any Wiki rules), was completely scratched by her. We thought that was ok. And:</p>
<p>2. Despite some disagreements, I immediately seized upon Craig Stuntz' offer to rewrite <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divje_Babe_7e94.html" title="Divje Babe">Divje_Babe</a> entirely (see <a href="../../../d/i/v/Talk%7EDivje_Babe_ffcd.html" title="Talk:Divje Babe">Talk:Divje_Babe</a>) and I instantly agreed he should go ahead (8 hours before you did). That's "refusal" to you? <i>You even placed, out of chronological order, a comment that you, too, agreed with Craig's proposal, putting it ahead of my agreement made 8 hours earlier than yours. If one didn't read the time-date, it could appear that I was a "me-too" succumbing to a "band-wagon" <b>preceeded by Rainwarrior</b> and Craig.</i> You have at other times similarly moved around his replies out of time. This is not the first, but this one looks unusual, because if placed chronologically it would still have been under an appropriate section, but would make you look like the me-too guy.</p>
<p>Virtually <i>All</i> your recent edits and activity for many weeks has been targeting only me, slandering me, <b>without</b> any grounds offered. Like the other pages which have material about ancient and prehistoric music (written long ago, and not by me), they will show that the edits (<i>I dare you to quote them all in full</i>) <b>rarely have my name in them,</b> and only sometimes are my webpages (<b>but</b> usually quoting material by <i>other</i> authors). How on earth does that "promote" my "profile"? This all is evidence and fact that you know or have read time and again, but ignore because it doesn't suit your corrupt campaign against me. Shameful behavior.</p>
<p>WIKI COI: 1. "You may cite your own publications just as you'd cite anyone else's, but make sure your material is relevant and that you're regarded as a reliable source for the purposes of Wikipedia. Be cautious about excessive citation of your own work, which may be seen as promotional or a conflict of interest." This shows that total silence is not what the rules prescribe for involved scholars.</p>

<dd>I must say that I do not in any way consider myself the writer of the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Fink_3972.html" title="Bob Fink">Bob Fink</a> entry, rather I stumbled upon an unencyclopedic article and did my level best to improve it. In this way, it was no different than many other articles in which I have chosen to participate. That said, I found the extent of the work to be more challenging and time consuming - in fact, I appear to have timed out. As the edit summary indicated, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Fink&amp;diff=74268831&amp;oldid=73850009" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Fink&amp;diff=74268831&amp;oldid=73850009" rel="nofollow">my edit</a> concerned the Manual of Style and general clean-up, the deletion of redundancies and advertising. Also deleted was an essay concerning Rosa Parks. A casual glance will reveal that much of the text of the new article was a rewritten or boiled down from the previous version. Information concerning Fink's renderings, contained at the end of the previous version, was inserted under "Biography"; otherwise the section remains virtually unchanged. This is all to say that I can't in any way claim to have "written" the entry, nor do I. The description is made all the more unrealistic by the fact that other users have performed more than 50 edits since.</dd>
<dd>I should add that I'm pretty much your average rock chick disco doll, and know nothing about prehistoric music, the origin of scales, or any other area of study referred to in the article. My participation in the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Fink_3972.html" title="Bob Fink">Bob Fink</a> article was a result of the clean-up challenges offered by the entry as it existed in September.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my extemely irritation by the great number of anonymous edits and posts, and reluctance by these same users to provide edit summaries. These have had no other effect than to throw up roadblocks. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 22:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>To Victoriagirl:</i> Here's the problem. The Supreme Court decision is good, but it may not have put on line all the references that it used, including the victory it cited which I won at the Human Rights Commission in 1986. At least I cannot find it on-line. That 1986 case was the initial victory which the Supreme court upheld, citing it to help justify its decision. I have only that clipping to indicate the initial victory and therefore prove that the Supreme court would be pursued for a ruling. There is nothing on-line about that first 1986 case. Why can't the clipping be used to show the legal history?</p>
<p>Okay, I found an archived link to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060312124927/http://www.gov.sk.ca/shrc/skrfal97p2.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060312124927/http://www.gov.sk.ca/shrc/skrfal97p2.htm" rel="nofollow">SHRC Saskatoon 1986</a> cited in Supreme Court File 22787 June 1, 1993). I hope this edit will be approved to give at least one on line verification of the cases? It has a short mention under the 1986 listings in column 2. This doesn't involve that clipping you removed.

<dl>
<dd>I think I've gone one better in that I've located the decision which clearly indicates that Robert Fink v. The City of Saskatoon was refered to by the Supreme Court. I've provided the link. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 08:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. All I wanted was to provide the reader with something more than a title &amp; file number -- which cannot verify anything if it's not on-line.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell me what's wrong with the referencing? -- I have no clue what's wanted. Are they saying (at the Watchlist page) that I need a bio already written and published somewhere else before this one can be allowed to exist? I find the wikipedia environment increasingly confusing. If you or anyone wants more references, please ask me so I can help satisfy what appears to me more and more to be people for whom nothing is ever satisfactory. Bob, Greenwyk 04:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC) P.s. I'm sorry if I've done anything at any point in all this to irritate you. I'm 71 is my only excuse for any of my failures at a confusing process.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I admit to being confused by your post, but hold out the hope that my response will clarify things:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I assume your initial question concerns the reference I recently provided for the Supreme Court ruling. The claim made in the article is this: "Among a number of legal cases in which he has been involved is one Fink won dealing with free speech, referred to in a ruling by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> for the right to put up posters on public poles." In the past, a 1985 newspaper article referring to your fight with the City of Saskatoon was cited as a source for this information. I believe I removed this twice, arguing the newspaper article fails to back up the statement - which, of course, is the purpose behind any reference. That said, you provided a Supreme Court file number, which, to these eyes, was more than adaquate. Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Fink&amp;diff=98604373&amp;oldid=98602998" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Fink&amp;diff=98604373&amp;oldid=98602998" rel="nofollow">recent addition</a> of the link to an archived Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission page refers only to your case, stating in total: "A board of inquiry orders the City of Saskatoon to repeal a bylaw that restricted postering on city property, saying it limited freedom of expression (Robert Fink v. The City of Saskatoon)." It makes no mention of the Supreme Court of Canada ruling, and so, again fails to suppport the sentence in question. Seeing this, I took it upon myself to investigate and found <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1993/1993rcs2-1084/1993rcs2-1084.html" class="external text" title="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1993/1993rcs2-1084/1993rcs2-1084.html" rel="nofollow">the complete text of the Supreme Court ruling</a> - courtesy of the Supreme Court of Canada website, no less. It seems to me that this is the perfect reference as it clearly indicates that your case was referred to in the ruling. Frankly, I can't understand why its use is questioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then again, perhaps you are questioning something else. You allude above to my desire for more references. I must say, I don't recall ever have expressed discontentment in this regard. Equally mysterious is the implication that my post on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Bob_Fink__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Bob_Fink__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" rel="nofollow">watchlist page</a> somhow questions the existance of this biography as it didn't exist previously elsewhere.

<p>I'm only questioning the new tag made by someone (not by you) for this bio article, tagged thus: <b>"This article or section needs sources or references that appear in credible, third-party publications.

<p>I'd like to find or propose remedies that will allow the tag to be satisfied or removed, but I cannot understand what (specifically) needs to be done regarding existing references, links or citations to accomplish getting the tag removed.

<p>Basically what this article needs are more inline citations from other websites than greenwich dot ca. As it stands, it's almost completely unreferenced, which is <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">not a good thing</a>. Also, at least one of the ISBNs is borked. If you're making claims that you've made into Nature and Science, we need the titles of such papers, preferably in {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}} format.

<p>One possible way to cleanup this article, given the history of it, would be to stubify it, moving all unreferenced content to talk page. Once reliable, secondary sources are found, these can be re-incorporated in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 17:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Have made a good start to provide, in edits, the references requested, namely, secondary references. Cannot seem to access or understand the system for editing &amp; numbering the references -- seems hidden from us, for example, the Supreme Court reference. Maybe computer here is too outdated? Anyway, the format can be changed by someone knowing how to access the system being used. But the references asked for have been listed, more secondary or "3rd-party" references will follow as details are located; and the text indicates in parentheses what is being verified by the added references.

As I’ve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Bob_Fink__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Bob_Fink__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" rel="nofollow">stated elsewhere</a>, this has made difficult the process of improving upon this particular entry. Simply put, I do not know to whom I am addressing specific comments and queries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Case in point, the post above was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Fink&amp;diff=99353003&amp;oldid=99121716" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Fink&amp;diff=99353003&amp;oldid=99121716" rel="nofollow">originally attributed</a> to 65.255.225.38 and appears to be from a body of some sort (“…seems hidden from us…”. “…references will follow as we locate the details…”). It has since undergone two edits, the second of which changed both the text and the user to Greenwyk. Both these changes run counter to <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">talk page guidelines</a>. I will, based on the user histories of both 65.255.225.38 and Greenwyk, assume in good faith that they are one and the same. I know that the latter user name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Fink&amp;diff=98591243&amp;oldid=98361682" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bob_Fink&amp;diff=98591243&amp;oldid=98361682" rel="nofollow">has been used by Bob Fink</a>, but it would appear to be representing more than one person in the post directly above. Before I waste any more time on this matter, could I ask the persons who posted this message to identify themselves? Are you one and the same, or has one user tampered with the communication of another? Most importantly, are you the same people responsible for 34 of the 35 edits made (as 65.255.225.38, 65.255.225.35, 65.255.225.52, 65.255.225.33 and Greenwyk) during the past four days? <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 19:39, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the present time all the recent edits trying to comply with the request that sources be of thrid-party publications, etc., have been made by myself. A year or so ago, the IP address was used by several people. At the present time, and for the future, I will be the only person to represent myself in this talk page, by IP address or by Greenwyk (when I remember to sign in). The "we" part is that this computer belongs to my publisher, Greenwich, and there are others here. But no one but me will be writing to this Talk page. -- Bob Fink, 65.255.225.36 11:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the interests of time I'll discuss the edits I've just made in point form:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-I've removed "(see "publications" in "References")". This is both unencyclopedic and unnecessary. The information is clearly included in the article and need not be pointed out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-I've removed a similar note, " (See references: "Nature Calls.") ", and the accompanying reference: ""Nature Calls," Henry Gee (H.Gee@nature.com) May 7 - Sept 9, 2002. (E-mails to Fink inviting participation as juror &amp; follow-ups. Sent by <i>Nature</i> journal's senior editor Henry Gee.)" Reference to private correspondence to which the public has no access cannot be used in answer to a citation request. I note that the text currently reads that Bob Fink was invited to participate, but does not state that he <i>did</i> participate. If the former is the case, I would argue that the information is so trivial in nature (no pun intended) that it not be included. In the case of the latter, I would think that Bob Fink's participation would have been acknowledged in <i>Nature</i> - the relevant issue or issues should be used as a reference source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-I've removed "(See references, <i>South End</i> and <i>5th Estate</i> newspapers)". This is unecessary as a reference source was already provided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-I've removed "(See references, <i>Vietnam...</i>, and excerpt in External Links)", used as a reference concerning Bob Fink's participation in student protest at Wayne State University, as the reference is to one of Bob Fink's own books. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>MER-C Explicitly demanded proof that I served as a juror. This information is <i>never</i> cited in journals, the names of jurors are never made public, for obvious reasons, namely, that jurors, after giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down on submitted articles, could be hassled afterward by rejected authors.</p>
<p>E-mails nowadays are like snail-mail letters to people which have <i>always</i> been used in biographical material since biographies were written. What rule states that the e-mails sent me cannot be cited that I served as a Juror for Nature? If the only issue is accessibility, then 1.) The Nature editor's e-mail address is in the verification -- readers can write to Nature to verify he did have me serve, if they want. 2.) If I place the e-mails he wrote me on a webpage, verbatim, headers and all, <i>it will be then accessible</i>. Will that be agreeable to you to use as a verification in that manner?</p>
<p>Being asked to be a juror is a great honour and recognition of what notability I 've earned in my field. Especially since so many editors are trying to kill this bio about me. I did serve as juror for many weeks. (See edit).</p>
<p>MER-C also wanted 2nd and 3rd party sources that I wrote in journals (or was cited in them). The "Articles list" you added may do the trick for MER-C. Do you think he'll accept it in the "Articles" format instead of them being in "References"?</p>
<p>The only source for my role in the take-over of WSU university is the book I wrote about it. The excerpt describes the take-over. A massive angry seizure of universities all across the USA by tens of thousands of students in protest of the murders at 4 unarmed passersby students at Kent State University by the National Guard, is obviously not like a corporate board-room meeting with secretaries who take minutes, and so there are no documentary sources for my specific role other than my own account. Please read it and decide for yourself if the <i>Vietnam</i> book can be the reference for the text statement? Being "Chairman" meant taking a bull-horn, getting on stage, and spending two to three days up there without sleep, trying to create peaceful order out of a surging mob of thousands of angy students, and creating a "peace university." The students accepted my leadership as effective and fair.</p>
<p>Living persons articles -- in the WIKI guides -- seems to allow personal accounts in a bio -- so can this "citation needed" be removed? Otherwise pieces of real personal <i>verifiable</i> history is going to end up erased. Is that a good thing in Wikipedia? There are photos in the book of me as an activist. I'm trying to prevent the factual statement from being erased here. It's part of my reality, and there are still many living people who can testify to my role, but they are not published authors. Just others who played similar roles. Their words can and would be citable in any hard-copy biography, I know, but again, in my case, that verification would come in the form of e-mail or snail-mail from them. It can be sent to you or wherever you like. Or put in a webpage. (Fink@the.link).</p>
<p>Please don't make the proof of my facts impossible to appear. I see <i>no rule</i> requiring that all citations or verifications HAVE TO BE only published news and journal material in my case, when it wouldn't be required in any other Wikipedia bio about any other more notable people. The purpose of verification in the forms of testimony, letters, etc., is so that history will not be buried due to lack of formal media write-ups or formal documents. I can write away to people to get those verifications for you, or put into a webpage, if necessary. Which is more important? The <i>form</i> of the verification or that the facts of the events be known, when still verifiable, but only by <i>other</i> forms? The editing process -- isn't it supposed to <i>help</i> the article become verified rather than hindering it?</p>
<p>During that period of violence in the '60's, activists lives (and family members) would have been endangered if we made our names public. So in news interviews, we rarely gave out our names, for self-protection. You may have read about what happened in the '60's to peace activists and civil rights workers in the U.S. South, whose identities were known? If not, then many were beaten, some were murdered. Our own Detroit peace offices were burned down then -- 1968 -- related in the Vietnam book. There are also documents reproduced in the book from the FBI (gained through the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA) which relate much of the '60's experience. Would citing them be verification? But again, they are accessible only in the book. The FBI doesn't publish documents about people they spied upon, like Martin Luthor King, except to those people using the FOIA.</p>
<p>I am happy with the changes you have made by listing articles, etc. I hope you can put back a few of those you removed to save the "Juror" facts in the text from being erased.</p>
<p>Anyway, at 71, I am too old, ill, and disabled to find enough energy or time to become a Wikipedian or learn new systems and "encyclopedic" rules by the ton about it. This is a hostile, unhealthy environment for me (not meaning you), and the combative ad-hominem attacks bring out the worst in many people, including myself. I prefer to move on to a much more humane loving scene where kindness rules, and rules are not used as weapons to destroy content or reality based on the immensely <i>contradictory guidelines</i> in Wikipedia which only serve to foster edit wars, fights, insults, and interminable pain for many people. Maybe I should have clicked the link you have somewhere on "how to be civil without really being civil" or some such title....??? Please do what you feel is true to history, to me, and to yourself. Au Revoir.</p>
<p>P.S. Quoting guidelines from Wikipedia -- Allowing sources like <i>Vietnam</i>: WP:COI: 1. "You may cite your own publications just as you'd cite anyone else's, but make sure your material is relevant and that you're regarded as a reliable source for the purposes of Wikipedia. Be cautious about excessive citation of your own work, which may be seen as promotional or a conflict of interest."</p>

<p>Question 2. again, from above: If I place the e-mails Nature editor Gee wrote me on a webpage, verbatim, headers and all, it will be then accessible. Will that be agreeable to you to use as a verification in that matter? Bob F. 65.255.225.42 19:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all due respect, asking whether something is agreeable to me seems to reflect a misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is all about. In the grand scheme of this great project my approval means nothing. Regardless of my opinion one way or another, I believe that the official policy concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">verifiability</a> would not support your proposal. In particular, I point to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" rel="nofollow">this section</a> which states: "Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." To include a claim based on private correspondence that is unpublished (in any form) and is entirely inaccessable, then post same on the web as a direct means of supporting the claim is suspect. I write this with the feeling that what you are saying is true - that you once served as a juror for <i>Nature</i> - but here such feelings simply do not count. Nor should they. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 21:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone just briefly tell me how, his self-publications and private correspondence aside, Bob Fink is verifiably notable? The only person who as of yet has tried to assert his notability is Bob Fink himself, and he insists on doing so in very long paragraphs where the reliable or verifiable stuff is heavily diluted with hearsay or padding. I really don't have the time to read the huge corpus of Bob Fink's talk page edits here and there, so can somebody please just give me some plain references to silence my suspicions? Because to an outside observer it really looks like Fink has no real claim at notability. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 15:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The most notable thing he seems to have done, academically, is make a claim that the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divje_Babe_7e94.html" title="Divje Babe">Divje Babe</a> artifact is not just a flute but a flute in the diatonic scale. This is an argument he has been cited for in multiple places.
