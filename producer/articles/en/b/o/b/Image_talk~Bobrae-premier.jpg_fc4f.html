	    <p>I believe that the image page already explains why this image is irreplaceable, which I quote again here:</p>
<p><i>This image depicts Bob Rae during his term as Premier of Ontario and leader of the New Democratic Party in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Current images cannot be used to accurately depict Rea during this era. Therefore, in articles about Rae as premier (as opposed to Rae as Liberal leadership candidate), this image is fair use as no alternative is available.</i></p>
<p>In fact, this image in particular was cited as an example of when the irreplaceable example could be applied to living politicians on the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Fair_use_images_of_Canadian_politicians_9a76.html#Exemption_for_older_pictures_of_politicians" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Fair use images of Canadian politicians">discussion page</a>. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 16:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. As long as this image is used <i>only</i> in the context of Rae as premier and <i>not</i> in articles about his recent work, it is irreplaceable and therefore fair use. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> 18:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't need one different image of a politician for every "<i>era</i>" of his career.

<dd>How do you reconcile that view with the lengthy discussion which was held at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Fair_use_images_of_Canadian_politicians_9a76.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Fair use images of Canadian politicians">Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Fair use images of Canadian politicians</a> when consensus agreed with the following assertion by <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">User:Yamla</a>, also an administrator, that:
<dl>
<dd><i>Such images would be allowed to depict the person as he appeared then ... along with a detailed fair-use rationale explaining why it was important to provide an older picture ... the image in this case would not be reasonably replaceable. This would not be acceptable as the lead picture depicting the person.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There was a consensus formed that older pictures of living politicians could be used, and this image was the very example used to reach that consensus! - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 18:23, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your quote from Yamla seems to be in accordance with what I said. I said "<i>we don't need one different image of a politician for every "</i>era<i>" of his career</i>" and he said that we may use unfree old images when we're able to provide "<i>a detailed fair-use rationale explaining <b>why it was important to provide an older picture</b></i> " (emphasis mine). There's nothing on the image talk page that explain why the articles <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rae_f137.html" title="Bob Rae">Bob Rae</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ontario_premiers_d16b.html" title="List of Ontario premiers">List of Ontario premiers</a> need an image to illustrate how this politician looked like circa 1980. And I can't think on a plausible reason for them to need such an image. --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 19:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the list of premiers, it would be misleading to have a picture of an old man to represent a premier who got the job when he was only 42. His age is notable in this case. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> 20:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, particularly where as it was a young looking 42. His "boyish looks" and "bold glasses" were often traits associated with Rae as premier. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 21:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The argument that it is not replaceable in <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rae_f137.html" title="Bob Rae">Bob Rae</a> appears sound however I d not find it to be irreplaceable in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ontario_premiers_d16b.html" title="List of Ontario premiers">List_of_Ontario_premiers</a>.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please explain, I would think that you could argue it is more replaceable in Bob Rae than in the list of Premiers as if it should ever be used it should be used when portraying Bob Rae as he appeared as premier. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 21:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That decision confused me as well. I see the two legitimate uses of this image as being in the List of Premiers and the premier infobox on Bob Rae's page. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArctic.gnome_882b.html" title="User talk:Arctic.gnome">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arctic.gnome_a82a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arctic.gnome">contribs</a>)</small> 21:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>List of...</i>" articles don't even need images. If we have a free image available, it's great, use it. But if we don't, there's no need to pollute it with an unfree image.

<p>This image depicts a Canadian politician, Bob Rae, who was elected Premier of Ontario 17 years ago. Since that time he has changed political parties and after 11 years in political retirement was a serious candidate for the leadership of one of Canada's two major parties and is currently a candidate for the Canadian parliament.</p>
<p>When Bob Rae served as premier he wore, and was known for, his distinct glasses and also his boyish looks. Today he has white hair and does not wear glasses or even look much like his younger self.</p>
<p>It is important to be able to depict the "two Bob Raes" and there is no free image available to depict Rae of the early 1990s. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 17:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
