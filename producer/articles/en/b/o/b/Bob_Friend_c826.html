<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Friend_c826.html" title="Edit section: Career overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career overview</span></h2>
<p>Friend was considered one of the most consistent and solid pitchers in the game, even considering the time he played in. Some remarked that he would not miss a start if he was dying.</p>
<p>After he attended <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purdue_University_4925.html" title="Purdue University">Purdue University</a>, the Pirates became interested in Friend, signing him in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950_in_sports.html" title="1950 in sports">1950</a>. His first season with them was a full one, and Friend went 6-10, not getting much run support from a horrible Pirates team that finished 6th in the 8-team league in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> and last in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a>. His <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">ERA</a> was 4.27 as he switched off as a starter and a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief_pitcher.html" title="Relief pitcher">reliever</a> in his rookie year, starting 22 games in 34 appearances.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/5/1955_in_sports.html" title="1955 in sports">1955</a> was clearly Friend's breakout season. The native of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeout.html" title="Strikeout">struck out</a> 98 batters in 20 starts and 44 games. His 2.83 ERA was best in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> but he ended with only a 14-9 record, again due to a terrible hitting Pirates team that this time finished 8th in an 8-team league in <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_scored.html" title="Runs scored">runs scored</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">hits</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a>. Friend was easily the best pitcher on the team, finishing with the best ERA, the most wins, the most appearances, and the most strikeouts. Teammate <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vern_Law_8afa.html" title="Vern Law">Vern Law</a> took 2nd place in most of those categories. Talk of Friend being the best pitcher in the league was legitiment as well, with his ERA beating out even <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Newcombe_45ab.html" title="Don Newcombe">Don Newcombe</a> (3.20), future <a href="../../../c/y/_/Cy_Young_Award_f830.html" title="Cy Young Award">Cy Young Award</a> and <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">MVP Award</a> winner. Most say Friend would have won it in 1955, the year before the award was first given in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956_in_sports.html" title="1956 in sports">1956</a>.</p>
<p>In 1956, Friend's statistics would improve drastically in some areas. In others, however, they were not as impressive. On the year, he was 17-17 with a 3.46 ERA and 166 strikeouts, 68 more than the year before. Other stats that improved included those falling under the endurance category. He pitched an amazing total of 314 <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings_pitched.html" title="Innings pitched">innings</a> (1st in the league) and started 42 games (1st in the league) in 49 appearances. He also had 19 <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complete_game.html" title="Complete game">complete games</a> (3rd in the league) and 4 <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shutout.html" title="Shutout">shutouts</a> (4th in the league). Friend's career looked to be on its way to the record books.</p>
<p>Friend didn't slow down after that, picking up outstanding <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957_in_sports.html" title="1957 in sports">1957</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958_in_sports.html" title="1958 in sports">1958</a> seasons. By 1957, he was only a starter basically. In 1958, his run support came as well and the Pirates finished in 2nd place. Friend went 22-14 that year, and his 22 wins were good for a tie for 1st in the league with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Spahn_2431.html" title="Warren Spahn">Warren Spahn</a>. He made his second <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star game</a> and came the closest to winning the Cy Young Award (3rd place). He continued his success into the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>After an average year in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_sports.html" title="1959 in sports">1959</a> for both him and his team, his career high in strikeouts (183) came in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960_in_sports.html" title="1960 in sports">1960</a>, and his only trip to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> (See: <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960_World_Series_7e1f.html" title="1960 World Series">1960 World Series</a>) came as well. The Pirates would win in a truly memorable world series against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, winning Game 7, 10-9. Although his team beat the Bronx Bombers, Friend's World Series was pretty weak, almost squandering the game for the Pirates in Game 7, when he let the Yankees come back from 2 runs down and tie the game. His postseason stats stand at an 0-2 record with a 13.50 ERA in 6 innings pitched.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_in_sports.html" title="1962 in sports">1962</a>, Friend tied for the league lead in shutouts with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gibson_cd41.html" title="Bob Gibson">Bob Gibson</a> (5). That year, he went 18-14 with a 3.06 ERA and pitched 261 innings. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_in_sports.html" title="1963 in sports">1963</a>, Friend eclipsed his previous career best in ERA, when he ended the season with a 2.34 ERA and 17-16 record. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">April 13</a> of that year, Friend gave up <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>'s first <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League</a> hit. That game, the major league record for <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balk.html" title="Balk">balks</a> occurred, with 7 (4 by Friend).</p>
<p>Friend's final complete season, and final season with the Pirates came in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_sports.html" title="1965 in sports">1965</a>. He went 8-12 with a 3.24 ERA in 34 starts before being traded to the Yankees for Pete Mikkelsen after the season.</p>
<p>After being moved again, Friend played his final game with the Mets on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">September 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_in_sports.html" title="1966 in sports">1966</a>. Friend remains the only pitcher to lose more than 200 (230), while winning less than 200 (197), mostly due to playing with 5 last place Pirate teams.</p>
<p>Friend ended his career with a 197-230 record and a 3.58 ERA. He had 1734 career strikeouts in 3611 innings pitched. Friend pitched 36 shutouts in 163 complete games. In 602 career games, he gave up 1438 earned runs. He <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_by_pitch.html" title="Hit by pitch">hit 46 batters</a> in his career.</p>
<p>As a batter, Friend hit .121 with 2 home runs and 60 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">RBIs</a>, three coming on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_in_sports.html" title="1954 in sports">1954</a> in an 18-10 win against the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. Friend currently lives in Pittsburgh.</p>
