<dd>Dear <i>Rhobite</i>, concerning the "genius" issue, I'm sorry but "considered by many" does sound odd to my ears. Can we compromise on the word "gift"? After all, a gift is a democratic thing, I have a gift, you have a gift, Bob Dylan has a gift. I'm thinking of the words in <i>Dear Landlord</i>:</dd>
<dd>Now each of us has his own special gift/And you know this was meant to be true/And if you don't underestimate me/I won't underestimate you.</dd>
<dd>Best wishes <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 08:28, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear <i>Rhobite</i>, I've made some changes to the <i>Chronicles</i> section which I would be happy to discuss. I feel strongly that Dylan's account of first hearing Robert Johnson, and his analysis of <i>Pirate Jenny</i> by Brecht/Weill are the most revealing accounts Dylan has given us of how he came to unlock his song writing genius. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">user: Mick gold</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the note. I think the section is very good now. A little worried about calling his song writing "genius". Although we obviously agree that Dylan's songwriting is genius, it isn't a neutral term. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 22:59, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reponse. Glad we can work together. Dylan's song writing genius is probably the one thing every contributor to this page will agree about. To call it Dylan's song-writing talent seems mealy-mouthed and inadequate. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">user: Mick gold</a> London 23.04 //10 March 2005</dd>

<p>I added a short section regarding the autobiography. I am happy to defend its inclusion, should anyone object.</p>
<p>I do question the list of Dylan's "best" songs as voted upon by a certain subset of his fans. I do not see the objective role this plays, especially in its position following a list of verifiable "most famous" songs. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry21_7898.html" title="User:Barry21">user: barry21</a></p>

<p>Somebody came in and changed the quote "What is this shit?" to "Who doesn't like Bob Dylan?"

<p>Made mild changes to a few phrases, added a few mostly neutral statements, re-ordered and expanded the most famous songs list, added a 'best songs' list. Hope this is ok. I'm new here.

<p>I made changes to the *fueled by drugs* line to *fueled by inner poetic vision*.The fueled by drugs line is based on speculation and not fact.The line also gave me the impression that without the use of drugs Bob wouldn't have written some of his best works, which (sadly) takes away from his poetic genius. -patti</p>
<hr />
<p>I restored the 'fueled by drugs' statement but modified it with 'some say fueled by drugs'. I think patti's change wasn't too fitting. If she knew the drug thing to be untrue, it would have been better to simply remove the reference without substituting an unrelated phrase for it. However, there's little doubt Dylan used drugs pretty extensively in those days. Whether the lyrics were 'fueled' by them is a debate readers ought to know about. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">User:JDG</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I know Bob did drugs .The word *fueled* is a bit harsh. Upon reading the sentence I get the idea that drugs might have taken a larger part in the creative process than creativity itself.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I wrote the original sentence (I think. It certainly reads like one of mine), and that is certainly not what I intended. Dylan's creative burst was from within himself, but it was the drugs that enabled him to maintain such a sustained burst without collapsing (or, at least, delaying the inevitable crash). I meant fuelled a quite literal sense: it was what enabled him to keep going. Having said that, I've absolutely no problem with the rewrites...</i> -- <a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">User:GWO</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think one might mistake the intended surreal artform for spur of the moment , drug induced visuals. The debate among Dylan fans is whether or not certain phrases are drug references. To think a brillant collection of works like Dylan's is *fueled* by drugs is a gross misunderstanding of drugs.</p>
<p>patti</p>
<hr />
<p>well patti, I hope you can live with the 'some say' modification <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">user:JDG</a></p>

<p>Hm, this article has some POV issues both pro- and con-, as far as I can see. Dare I step into the fray? <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 19:03 21 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there are som POV issues here. Also someone put a weasel word in the very first line with <i>is widely regarded as perhaps America's greatest popular songwriter born in the Twentieth Century.</i> That "perhaps" has no business being there. I hate "one of ... greatest" constructions, but even that's better, imo.</p>
<dl>

<p>The first two paragraphs struck me as general material that would serve better as a preamble, rather than as part of the 'Beginnings' section. I've also shifted the picture to the top of the article.

<dd>Well, for the record, those first two paragraphs were the original stub article, before I added a much longer, chronological article beneath (most of which comprises what is now this article.) Thats why it seems disjointed, it is. FWIW, I think it works well as a preamble, as you've arranged it. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a> 18:27, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to formally apologize for any insensitivity I may have show to the work of others in my substantial edit of the Dylan page. I think that it is a function of both overzealousness as a new Wikipedia reader, and cockiness (at least in the realm of Dylan) which I became aware of only AFTER the edit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am still unsure about the 'most famous' and opposed the the 'best' lists. 'Most famous' can have some objective basis, if the songs so designated are accompanied by Billboard chart positions or lists of how many artists have subsequently covered them, but it is shaky ground. "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" certainly did better for Guns 'N' Roses than for Bob.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have to agree. "America's greatest songwriter" would depend upon a majority of Americans knowing who he is, and few people I know have heard of the guy. Perhaps "one of America's greatest songwriters" wou;d work better? --<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b. Touch</a> 13:20, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To deem any subset of his output as the best is much more difficult to argue objectively. To his record label, the best songs would be the most famous, as they probably made the most money. To an English professor nominating Dylan for a Nobel, the complexity of thought and construction might determine the song's quality. To a fan, the 1976 version of a 1965 compostion might bring it new life and raise it in that fan's esteem.</p>
<p>I understand the drive to include such a list, but I am convinced of neither its basis or value. Actually, I think the list is inappropriate for reasons similar to the headings that I took from his lyrics. If it is not a fanzine, then the article should not include a section which will be a cause for debate. Along with the authors before me, I did try to include the most famous or best (or whatever they are) songs within the body of the text.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems the Wiki style to include a list of singles &amp; chart positions for musicians. Most of the other articles for musical acts feature such lists. --<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b. Touch</a> 13:20, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The "fueled" by drugs line can be defended. By 1965, Dylan was a full-on speed freak. This does not diminish the songs of that period; drugs do have a long and noble history in the arts. Furthermore, meth cannot put together a thought, strum a guitar, or sing a note. It can however, occupy an important postition in the life of the artist, supplanting meals at times. The speed use was evidenced in his demeanor in interviews from that time, the sharpening features of his face as he lost weight, and second-hand accounts from the likes of Allen Ginsberg and Robbie Robertson. I think that the word 'fueled' was the sticking point; I never meant to suggest that a fuel somehow guided the inspiration and brilliance of his writing.</p>
<p>I am really sorry for all the toes that I now see I stomped on. I hope I have cleared up some of the mess I made. (To be honest, this is the first time I have visited this 'talk' page, as I didn't even know about it then.) I would be happy to discuss any of my points further if necessary. Barry21 2/19/04 15:45</p>
<hr />
<p>I also made a small addition in the text concerning The Basement Tapes and John Wesley Harding. I think it might be useful to highlight Dylan's self-imposed exile from the psychedelia he helped create. There is not enough said about Dylan influencing The Beatles on Revolver and beyond. Revolver is clearly referenced on both "Blonde on Blonde" and The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds." Paul McCartney has said the "Sgt. Pepper" was the Beatles' effort to match Brian Wilson's brilliance. These guys tried to one-up each other with each release, and then Dylan took himself out of the game with JWH. He seemed to derive more pleasure from stern Biblical allegory than from LSD, Maharishi, or sandboxes in the living room. Barry 21 2/19/04 16:08</p>
<hr />
<p>One more thing... the documentary is called "Dont Look Back". I don't know why, but they left out the apostrophe. Barry21 2/19/04 16:28</p>

<dd>Well Barry, you've made quite a few worthy additions. Unfortunately you've also deleted quite a few sentences and phrases which certainly belonged. Also, proofreading isn't a particular strength of yours (example: "His 1978 album Street Legal was well reviewed and lyrically one of his most complex and absorbing, although its production was uncharacteristacally intrusive."). Have you discovered the PREVIEW button yet? You should preview all your changes carefully before committing them... On the whole I think the article will benefit from your coming around, but GWO and I and others will have to wade through it with pruning hooks. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 21:34, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to suggest a convention for album and song titles. Album titles should be put in normal quotation marks while song titles should be italicized. I think it helps the look of the text.

With that said, I love Dylan (I, personally, think he is the greatest living artist in the world today) but the neutrality of the article is something to consider.

<dd>Totally disagree. The reference to the other great American songwriters through the centuries is essential in conveying to the reader just how esteemed Dylan is. Your deletion leaves the impression that Dylan ranks somewhere near the top of his generation, among the Carole Kings, Diane Warrens, Neil Youngs and Kris Kristoffersons. This is a misleading impression. By consensus, Dylan is considered to be in a class of his own-- a consensus fully shared by almost all other contemporary songwriters. The best way to convey this is to list him among the nonpareils of preceding generations. In fact, the Stephen Foster--&gt;Woody Guthrie--&gt;Bob Dylan lineage constitutes the main trunk of American song from the mid 1800s to the present. Removing the expression of this lineage seriously diminishes the entire article... The primary author of this long-Featured article is GWO. I have been the secondary author. We will need more than the whim of Zoso Jade and TacoDeposit to overturn this long accepted intro paragraph.

<dd>First of all, nothing was done on my whim. I stated an opinion. Second of all, I do not believe that in order to convey Dylan's status as premiere song-writer of his generation requires premieres of other generations to be included at the top of his article. If it were to be referenced somewhere else later in the article that could be understandable, but it's place in the first paragraph of Dylan's page implies some sort of strong link between the writers when none really exists. Note, Bill Gates' first paragraph has no reference to, say, John Rockerfeller and rightly so. Third of all, if it is necessary to state the consensus that Dylan is in a class of his own for his generation it is probably <i>less</i> misleading to overtly state this fact than to simply list him with other writers who the average reader is <i>less</i> likely to have heard of than Dylan himself.<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a></dd>

<dd>Sorry if my tone was a bit brusque-- I didn't mean it to be. But I must continue to (respectfully) disagree. I think if you were to look into the matter more you would be surprised at how consciously Dylan, and even certain other contemporary songwriters who are basically thought of as "rockers" by John Q. Public, have considered the past greats and the continuum of American song. Even before he seriously began writing his own songs, Dylan had made an informal but intense study of Stephen Foster's works, as well as Robert Johnson's and Kurt Weill's. And it's well known he all but patterned himself on Guthrie. You say it's wrong to imply "some sort of strong link between the writers when none really exists". I'd say the phrase "strong link" is an understatement. The Foster-&gt;Guthrie-&gt;Dylan continuum is beyond strong-- it's fundamental and irreducible and Dylan was aware of it the whole time (check out Chronicles Vol. 1). <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 05:58, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's only natural to pattern yourself after someone," [Dylan] says, opening a door on a subject that has long been off-limits to reporters: his songwriting process. "If I wanted to be a painter, I might think about trying to be like Van Gogh, or if I was an actor, act like Laurence Olivier. If I was an architect, there's Frank Gehry. But you can't just copy somebody. If you like someone's work, the important thing is to be exposed to everything that person has been exposed to. Anyone who wants to be a songwriter should listen to as much folk music as they can, study the form and structure of stuff that has been around for 100 years. I go back to Stephen Foster."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV and "widely regarded as America's greatest living popular songwriter"</span></h2>
<p>BlankFaze changed the line "[Dylan is] widely regarded as America's greatest living popular songwriter" to "[Dylan is] widely regarded as one of America's greatest living popular songwriters". At first glance it looks like a laudably NPOV edit. But in fact it's just a watering down of an already NPOV statement. And the act of watering down detracts from the article and its ability to convey just how strongly Americans of the post-WWII generation feel that Mr. Dylan is in a class of one. This is not fan stuff. It's just accurately portraying the consensus of a generation on one of its most important artists.</p>
<p>How can the line "[Dylan is] widely regarded as America's greatest living popular songwriter" be NPOV already? The key is the word "widely". Yes there are some who would not give Dylan this title. They are among the narrow strip of people with opinions on the matter who would choose someone else. The others (the great majority) are expressed in that phrase "widely regarded". That is all the qualification the statement needs to be NPOV. It is not the writer's POV, it's an accurate reporting of the American public's POV. Let's not doggedly try to level everybody out. Give greatness, and great renown, its due in articles and don't be ashamed of it.</p>
<p>If you find yourself disagreeing, please remind yourself that we are talking here strictly about <b>songwriters</b>, not singer/songwriters or performers or recording artists. This is not Bob Dylan vs. Aerosmith or 50 Cent or Madonna. It is Bob Dylan compared to other crafters of original lyrics and melodies. It makes no statement on the rank of his own recordings or live performances. Now, who will you seriously put up with Dylan since 1950 as a lyricist and tune composer? Remember also that we're talking about lifetime output. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 07:42, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The statement at current is <b>most definitely</b> not NPOV. I don't see how you can call any statement that refers to a person as the one and undisputed "greatest" of anything NPOV. I don't think he is "widely regarded" as America's greatest living songwriter. A lot of people can't stand him. I know some people that think he's terrible.

<dd>You misread the sentence. If the sentence read "he is America's greatest living songwriter", THAT would be POV. Saying "he is widely regarded as" is both NPOV and true.

<dd>We're talking about the estimation of an American artist by other Americans as ranked among Americans, though there'e no doubt of the tally among non-Americans also (those plugged into American culture enough to have an opinion at all, of course). Would they say "Dylan is the best songwriter in the world?" No. Would they say he is the greatest living <i>American</i> songwriter?" Yes, and that's what the pre-Blankfaze article said... You guys aren't using your heads. Come up with even one <b>songwriter</b> (not "singer", not "rock star", not "musician", not "performer") that can be mentioned in the same breath as Dylan for a body of original songs.

To answer your previous question, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon come to mind. Joni Mitchell and Neil Young if you count Canada (hey, restricting it to America is pretty arbitrary). Whether one of these artists is "widely regarded as America's greatest living popular songwriter" is unknowable, and discussing this is pointless. I'm not going to discuss the merits of any of these artists - I just want to point out that many people would disagree with the unqualified statement that Dylan is widely regarded as the best.

<dd>The above NPOV point may seem reasonable in the abstract, but seems like a silly position in the context of what's actually been written by music and literary critics. I'm a big fan of Springsteen, and also of Simon, Mitchell and Young. And if a vote for greatest were taken, I suppose each would get a few votes; ever fan is entitled to an opinion. But to put them in the same league as Dylan in terms of the mass of critical opinion about who is the greatest living American songwriter is silly. I mean let's get real. We can argue about whether Dylan actually <i>is</i> the greatest, but I don't think there's really any argument that he is <i>widely</i> viewed as such. The fact that some would disagree about his merits does not change this; the fact that some think he's terrible doesn't change this. To argue that one has to be universally viewed as such before one can be objectively said to be widely viewed as such really would be a worrying trend for Wikipedia to go down. Dylan's songs have been covered far more widely than any of the above, far, far more has been written about them, he's been more influential, and so forth. Particularly with regard to the lyrics, I think there is absolutely no quesiton that he can objectively be said to be widely seen as the the greatest. His lyrics are, for instnace, considered to be serious poetry by serious students of poetry who are otherwise unconnected to the entire genre of popular music. He has been nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature by serious literary scholars. Nobody would take seriously the nomination of any of the others you mention, probably not of <i>any</i> other songwriter. living or dead. The merits of an artist will always be a matter of opinion, but even matters of tast, broad (though never universal) consensus does sometimes emerge, and it seems fair to report on it: Bob Dylan <i>is</i> widely regarded as America's greatest living popular songwriter69.110.151.176 18:34, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Love and Theft, the theft part</span></h2>
<p>I think the discussion of Love and Theft is incomplete without some reference to the "thefts" that the record is full of: both the musical appropriation of older songs for Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, Bye and Bye, Floater, and Sugar Baby, and the lyric thefts from Junichi Saga's <i>Confessions of a yakuza</i>, should be mentioned. Not only as an example of Dylan's "collage" style of writing, which puts L&amp;T and Empire Burlesque in the same category, and the "folk" way of regarding tradition, but also as an opportunity to comment on the numerous accusations of plagiarism (Canadee-I-O, many of the early songs, Dignity, etc.). I think it's a necessary complement to the notion of folk-icon-turned-crooner. I've written quite a lot about this on my site, <a href="http://www.dylanchords.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dylanchords.com" rel="nofollow">dylanchords</a>, and I can easily put together a encyclopedia style summary of it, if it is wanted. <a href="../../../e/y/o/User%7EEyolf_9702.html" title="User:Eyolf">eyolf</a></p>

<p>I don't know too much about your general point, but I do know that on the official Bob Dylan page, Canadee-I-O (like everything else on Good As I Been To You) is not attributed to Dylan, it is said to be "arranged" by him, not written. He certainly arranged it, did he not?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary of popular music</span></h2>
<p>I don't see how this can possibly be true:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>More broadly, Dylan is credited with expanding the vocabulary of popular music, moving it beyond traditional boy-and-girl themes into the heady realms of politics/social commentary, philosophy, and a kind of stream-of-consciousness absurdist humor that defies easy description.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>American popular music, especially folk music (which is what Dylan played) has never been composed primarily of "traditional boy-and-girl themes". Long before Dylan it was characterized largely by themes of political and social commentary. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodie_Guthrie_5934.html" title="Woodie Guthrie">Woodie Guthrie</a> is one obvious earlier example, but even he hardly invented the genre. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 19:26, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're a bit off on the meaning of the term "popular music" here. The old folk music you refer to was not "popular music" in the sense meant here. It may have been "music of the people" (what else would "folk" music be?), but it was not "pop". The contemporary understanding of this term ("popular music") implies charting music at and since the advent of mass media. So, Dylan did expand the vocabulary of pop by opening it to the weird goings-on of the old folk stuff as well as his own rhymed-stream-of-consciousness stuff, which was new at the time even if it was inevitable, given what was happening with poetry and fiction. So... Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, etc.,. weren't pop. Pop was Bing Crosby, Elvis, Nat King Cole, Bobby Vinton, 1963 Beatles. Dylan was the first to chart using a vocabulary that busted through all those well-worn themes. Why else do you think John Lennon knew it was time for a sea-change upon first hearing Freewheelin'? <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 23:47, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I really see the distinction. Woodie Guthrie recorded several albums that sold quite well for major-label recording houses in the 1940s. How is that not "charting music at and since the advent of mass media"? At the very least, I think "popular music" ought to be changed to "pop music", as the two terms no longer mean the same thing, despite the historic derivation of one from the other. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 01:20, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">John Wesley Harding/Nashville Skyline</span></h2>
<p>It isn't entirely clear that The Band didn't actually perform on <i>Harding</i>. And maybe some mention should be made of (and I know it's a little bit of a cliche) the Nashville studio musicians who are rather prominent on <i>Skyline</i>.</p>
<p>Also, where's Mick Ronson's name in the list of Live 75'ers. His signature guitar work really contributed to the overall sound of the shows.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Links</span></h2>
<p>I've done some cleaning up and organizing of the links. Updated some, removed some (I don't know if a dylan tribute band home page belongs here, e.g., nor a blog post about Chronicles - why that particular one, and not the millions of other similar posts...?), and added some. I've also categorized them. The headings are just a suggestion.--<a href="../../../e/y/o/User%7EEyolf_9702.html" title="User:Eyolf">eyolf</a> 10:11, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Rhobite's general statement, that only links to sites with new contents should be included, but one of the links that was removed (the one to "It's not a house it's a home page") actually does contain new information: it is not simply a lyric site, but has outtakes, alternative versions, live covers, etc. - much of the same as dylanchords.com, but still with quite a lot of additional information. I won't re-add it, but I think it should be considered, as a useful resource well worth a link. Some of the other links also need some reconsideration, I think.--<a href="../../../e/y/o/User%7EEyolf_9702.html" title="User:Eyolf">eyolf</a> 15:33, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eyolf I think you should "be bold" and add whatever links you feel are truly noteworthy. You seem to be versed in `net Dylandom so I think we can trust you to keep out schlock sites and people looking to boost their Google ratings, etc.,. I agree with Rhobite that we don't need various lightweight lyrics sites because bobdylan.com is up there with all official lyrics and a good dedicated search engine. However, since the D man is always stirring, and has always stirred, the pot so much, there are dozens of alternate lyrics for officially released songs as well as lyrics for never released songs which make no appearance on bobdylan.com. So, we should welcome one or two lyrics sites that have been prominent in Dylandom long before Wikipedia existed and that provide these variant and unreleased lyrics. Maybe you can decide which should be included here? Also, Rhobite, keep in mind that bobdylan.com does not have chords or tabbing. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 00:29, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah I try not to remove sites with additional info such as guitar tabs. Sorry if I removed a useful site, please don't hesitate to put it back. It's just irritating to see all these drive-by lyrics spammers. Lyric sites are a dime a dozen and Wikipedia gets spammed with them all the time. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 05:58, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
