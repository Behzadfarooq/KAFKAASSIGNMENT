<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Established in 1927 near <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_City_1cc3.html" title="Panama City">Panama City</a>, on the Florida panhandle, Bob Jones College moved to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Tennessee_47a7.html" title="Cleveland, Tennessee">Cleveland, Tennessee</a> in 1933, and to its present campus in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_South_Carolina_7db2.html" title="Greenville, South Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a> in 1947, where it became Bob Jones University.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> From its inception, BJU has been located in the South "but has never had a predominantly southern constituency." In 2006, the state with the largest number of students enrolled was South Carolina, but many of these were married students who had moved from other parts of the country to attend the University. Other states with large representations in the student body are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: Academics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Academics</span></h2>
<p>The University consists of seven colleges and schools that offer more than 125 undergraduate majors, including fourteen associate degree programs in such fields as cosmetology, aircraft maintenance, residential construction, and culinary arts management. Although BJU has an unranked and untenured faculty, most University employees consider their positions as much ministries as jobs. It is common for retiring professors to have served the University for thirty, forty, and even occasionally, fifty years, a circumstance that has contributed to the stability and conservatism of an institution of higher learning that has virtually no endowment.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Accreditation" id="Accreditation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: Accreditation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accreditation</span></h3>
<p>Bob Jones, Sr. was leery of academic accreditation almost from the founding of the college, and by the early 1930s, he had publicly stated his opposition to holding membership in a regional accrediting association. Not surprisingly, Jones and the college were criticized for this stance, and academic recognition, as well as student and faculty recruitment, were hindered.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1944, Jones wrote to John Walwoord of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Theological_Seminary_dddf.html" title="Dallas Theological Seminary">Dallas Theological Seminary</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me make it clear: we have no objection to educational work highly standardized….We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years later, Jones reflected that “it cost us something to stay out of an association, but we stayed out. We have lived up to our convictions.”<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the University more than doubled in size.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because graduates did not have the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup> Early in the history of the college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJC credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being welcomed by graduate and professional schools throughout the country, and once there, BJU graduates easily proved their competence. Some graduate schools even recruited BJU alumni, frequently ignoring their own rules restricting admissions to graduates of accredited institutions. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> It was also helpful that some of the University’s strongest programs were in music and speech, where ability would be measured by audition rather than paper qualifications.</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, however, the University quietly reexamined its position on accreditation as <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degree_mills.html" title="Degree mills">degree mills</a> proliferated and various bureaucracies excluded BJU graduates on the grounds that the University did not appear on appropriate governmental lists. In 2004, the University began the process of joining the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnational_Association_of_Christian_Colleges_and_Schools_dba1.html" title="Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools">Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a>. Candidate status—effectively, accreditation—was obtained in April 2005, and full membership in the Association was conferred in November 2006. Because TRACCS grants accreditation only to evangelical Christian institutions of higher learning, the administration believed that the University could obtain the benefits of accreditation without losing its academic independence.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Religion" id="Religion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: Religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
<p>The School of Religion trains approximately five hundred ministerial students per year. Although many of these men (no women are permitted in the ministerial class) go on to seminary after completing their undergraduate degree, many others take ministry positions straight from college, and rising juniors participate in a church internship program to prepare them for the pastoral ministry. Because BJU graduates often preach at smaller, less prestigious churches, the social and religious influence of BJU ministerial graduates is frequently underestimated.</p>
<p>The University encourages church planting in areas of the United States where few fundamentalist churches exist, and it has provided financial and logistical assistance to ministerial graduates in starting more than a hundred new works.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup> Bob Jones III has also encouraged non-ministerial students to put their career plans on hold for two or three years to provide lay leadership in small fundamentalist churches. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Students of various majors voluntarily participate in Mission Prayer Band, an organization that prays for missionaries and attempts to stimulate campus interest in world evangelism. During summers and Christmas breaks, dozens of students also participate in teams that use their musical, language, trade, and aviation skills to promote Christian missions around the world.</p>
<p>Although formally a separate organization, Gospel Fellowship Association Missions is the mission board of BJU and is one of the largest fundamentalist mission boards in the country.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup> But because foreign nationals can often reach their own people more effectively than American missionaries, the University also sponsors the education of international students through its "Timothy Program" and "WORLD Fund."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: Fine Arts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fine Arts</span></h3>
<p>More faculty teach in the Division of Fine Arts than in any other school of the University. The University presents an opera in the spring and a Shakespearean play each semester. A Sunday afternoon service called “Vespers,” presented occasionally throughout the school year, combines music, speech, and drama and attracts visitors from the Greenville community because of its blending of the devotional and cultural.</p>
<p>Each fall, as a recruiting tool, the University sponsors a "High School Festival" in which students compete in music, art, and speech (including preaching) contests with their peers from around the country. In the spring, a similar competition sponsored by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_of_Christian_Schools_a808.html" title="American Association of Christian Schools">American Association of Christian Schools</a>, and hosted by BJU since 1977, brings thousands of national finalists to the University from around the country. In 2005, 120 of the finalists from previous years returned to BJU as freshmen.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are two main campus libraries: The Mack Library and the Music Library, the latter located in the Gustafson Fine Arts Center. The 90,000-square-foot Mack Library (named for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sephus_Mack_cba4.html" title="John Sephus Mack">John Sephus Mack</a>) includes seating for twelve hundred as well as a computer lab and a computer classroom. The library houses more than three hundred thousand volumes—a modest collection for a school the size of BJU but strong in the area of religion. Mack Library also contains the “Jerusalem Chamber,” a replica of the room in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> in which work on the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a> of the Bible was conducted, and a Memorabilia Room that treats the life of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Sr._bb68.html" title="Bob Jones, Sr.">Bob Jones, Sr.</a> and the history of the University.</p>
<p>Of greater importance to potential researchers is the Fundamentalism File and the University Archives. Articles in the Fundamentalism File are computer searchable, and an increasing amount of material in the Archives is as well.</p>
<p>The Fundamentalism File, a library division created in 1978, collects non-book items--mostly periodical articles--on subjects of interest to Fundamentalists, and now has more than a hundred thousand articles listed under five thousand subject headings. The File also contains the papers of three notable twentieth-century fundamentalists: G. Archer Weniger (1915-1982), W. O. H. Garman (1899-1983), and Gilbert Stenholm (1915-1989).</p>
<p>The University Archives holds copies of all University publications, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_histories.html" title="Oral histories">oral histories</a> of faculty and staff members, surviving remnants of University correspondence, and pictures and artifacts related to the Jones family and the history of the University--including, for instance, decades of working scripts for University stage performances.</p>

<p>The university requires all unmarried incoming freshman students under the age of 23 to join one of 48 "literary societies." Societies meet weekly on Fridays for entertainment and fellowship, and they also hold a weeknight prayer meeting. Societies field sports, debate, and Scholastic Bowl teams. The latter compete in an annual single-elimination tournament that concludes with a clash between the top two teams before a University-wide audience on the Thursday before Commencement. Questions include a wide range of biblical and academic topics -- but none from popular culture.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: Billy Graham">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Billy Graham</span></h4>
<p>One of the earliest controversies to swirl around BJU was the break that occurred in the late 1950s between the University and evangelist <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the University conferred an honorary degree on him in 1948. During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism, and in 1957, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship for his New York Crusade.</p>
<p>Bob Jones, Sr. argued that if members of Graham’s campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_birth.html" title="Virgin birth">virgin birth</a> and the deity of Christ, then Graham had violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do “not abide in the teaching of Christ.” In the 1960s, Graham further irritated fundamentalists by gaining the endorsement of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cardinal_Cushing_94e3.html" title="Richard Cardinal Cushing">Richard Cardinal Cushing</a> for his Boston campaign and accepting honorary degrees from two Roman Catholic colleges.</p>
<p>Graham tried to remain above the fray, but members of his staff openly accused Jones of jealousy because Jones’s evangelistic meetings had never been as large as Graham’s. Graham’s father-in-law, L. Nelson Bell, mailed a fiery ten-page letter to most members of the BJU faculty and student body (as well as to thousands of pastors across the country) accusing Jones of “hatred, distortions, jealousies, envying, malice, false witnessing, and untruthfulness.”</p>
<p>In what seemed to the Joneses to be a deliberate affront, Graham held his only American campaign of 1966 in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_South_Carolina_7db2.html" title="Greenville, South Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a>. Under penalty of expulsion, the University forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending the Graham meetings. In a four-page position paper delivered to students in 1965, Bob Jones, Jr., condemned Billy Graham's "ecumenical evangelism" as unscriptural and "heretical," noting that Graham shared his platform with Catholic priests and that one could not "be a good Catholic and a good, spiritual Christian." When Graham arrived in Greenville, Jones, Jr. emphasized that the basis of the University's position was scriptural and not personal. "The Bible commands that false teacher and men who deny the fundamentals of the faith should be accursed; that is, they shall be criticzed and condemned. Billy approves them, Billy condones them, Billy recommends them....I think that Dr. Graham is doing more harm in the cause of Jesus Christ than any living man; that he is leading foolish and untaught Christians, simple people that do not know the Word of God, into disobedience to the Word of God."<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The negative publicity caused by the rift with Graham precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956-59. Seven members of the University board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself and two of his staff members. But by 1966, when Graham appeared in Greenville, the enrollment had strongly rebounded and continued to grow thereafter until the mid-1980s.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Edit section: King James Bible">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">King James Bible</span></h4>
<p>The University uses the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a> (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. The <a href="../../../k/i/n/King-James-Only_Movement_983b.html" title="King-James-Only Movement">King-James-Only Movement</a>—or more correctly, movements, since it has many variations—became a divisive force in fundamentalism only as conservative modern Bible translations, such as the New American Standard Bible (NASB) and the New International Version (NIV) began to appear in the 1970s.</p>
<p>BJU has taken the position that orthodox Christians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (including fundamentalists) agreed that while the KJV was a substantially accurate translation, only the original manuscripts of the Bible written in Hebrew and Greek were infallible and inerrant. Bob Jones, Jr. called the KJV-only position a "heresy" and "in a very definite sense, a blasphemy."<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The University's stand has been condemned by some other fundamentalists, especially a number of small Bible schools and colleges who have made Bible translation a means of distinguishing themselves from what they also consider an error or heresy in mainstream fundamentalism. Notoriously, in 1998, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensacola_Christian_College_283f.html" title="Pensacola Christian College">Pensacola Christian College</a> attacked BJU in a widely distributed videotape, arguing that this "leaven of fundamentalism" was passed from the nineteenth-century Princeton theologian <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_B._Warfield_5b23.html" title="Benjamin B. Warfield">Benjamin B. Warfield</a> (1851-1921) to Charles Brokenshire (1885-1954), who served BJU as Dean of the School of Religion, and then to current BJU faculty members and graduates.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[35]</a></sup> Ironically, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Ruckman_d784.html" title="Peter Ruckman">Peter Ruckman</a>, a BJU graduate, has argued the most extreme version of the KJV-only position, that all translations of the Bible since the KJV have been of satanic origin.

For instance, Jones, Jr. once said that Catholicism was "not another Christian denomination. It is a satanic counterfeit, an ecclesiastic tyranny over the souls of men....It is the old harlot of the book of the Revelation—'the Mother of Harlots.'" All popes, Jones asserted, "are demon possessed." In 2000, then-president Bob Jones III referred, on the University's web page, to Mormons and Catholics as "cults which call themselves Christian."<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[36]</a></sup> Furthermore, in 1966, BJU awarded an honorary doctorate to the Rev. <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a>, future British MP, leader of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Unionist_Party_b2cc.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a>, and Moderator of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Presbyterian_Church_84a0.html" title="Free Presbyterian Church">Free Presbyterian Church</a> of Ulster, who has referred to the Pope as a "Roman anti-Christ."</p>
<p>Bob Jones III has argued that the University is not so much anti-Catholic or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormon_f738.html" title="Anti-Mormon">anti-Mormon</a> as it is opposed to the idea that all men, regardless of religious beliefs, will eventually get to heaven: "Our shame would be in telling people a lie, and thereby letting them go to hell without Christ because we loved their goodwill more than we loved them and their souls….

<p>Although it admitted Asians and other minorities from its inception, BJU refused to enroll <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%28people%29.html" title="Black (people)">black</a> students until 1971, eight years after the University of South Carolina and Clemson University had been integrated by court order. From 1971 to 1975, BJU admitted only married blacks, although the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) had already determined in 1970 that "private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies" were not entitled to federal tax exemption. Late in 1971, BJU filed suit to prevent the IRS from taking its tax exemption, but in 1974, in <i>Bob Jones University v. Simon</i>, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled that the University did not have standing to sue until the IRS actually assessed taxes. Four months later, on May 29, 1975, the University Board of Trustees authorized a change in policy to admit "students of any race," a move that occurred shortly before the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in <i>Runyon</i> v. <i>McCrary</i> (427 U.S. 160 [1976]), which prohibited racial exclusion in private schools.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The university did not admit unmarried blacks until 1975. In a 2000 interview, the then-president, Bob Jones III, said that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interracial_dating.html" title="Interracial dating">interracial dating</a> had been prohibited since 1950s and that the policy had originated in a complaint by parents of a male Asian student who believed that their son had "nearly married" a white girl.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[39]</a></sup> In May 1975, as it prepared to allow unmarried blacks to enroll, BJU adopted more detailed rules prohibiting interracial dating and marriage—threatening expulsion for any student who dated or married interracially, who advocated interracial marriage, who was "affiliated with any group or organization which holds as one of its goals or advocates interracial marriage," or "who espouse, promote, or encourage others to violate the University's dating rules and regulations." <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>

The school appealed the IRS decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the University met all other criteria for tax-exempt status and that the school's racial discrimination was based on sincerely held religious beliefs, that "God intended segregation of the races and that the Scriptures forbid interracial marriage." <sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[41]</a></sup> The University was not challenged about the origin of its interracial dating policy, and the District Court accepted "on the basis of a full evidentiary record" BJU's argument that the rule was a sincerely held religious conviction, a finding affirmed by all subsequent courts.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[42]</a></sup> In December 1978, the federal district court ruled in the University's favor; two years later, that decision was overturned by the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals_c07b.html" title="Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals">Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>.</p>

Also, in the year following the Court decision, contributions to the University declined by 13 percent.</p>
<p>In 2000, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<p>As a twelve-year-old, Bob Jones, Sr. made a twenty-minute speech in defense of the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist_Party_%28United_States%29_a236.html" title="Populist Party (United States)">Populist Party</a>. Jones was a friend and admirer of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jennings_Bryan_d775.html" title="William Jennings Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> but also campaigned throughout the South for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> (and against <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Smith_22a8.html" title="Al Smith">Al Smith</a>) during the 1928 presidential election. Even the authorized history of BJU notes that both Bob Jones, Sr. and Bob Jones, Jr. “played political hardball” when dealing with the three municipalities in which the school was successively located. For instance, in 1962, Bob Jones, Sr. warned the Greenville City Council that he had “four hundred votes in his pocket and in any election he would have control over who would be elected.” <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Almost from the inception of Bob Jones College, a majority of students and faculty were northerners, and therefore many were already Republicans living in the "<a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_South_d12f.html" title="Solid South">Solid South</a>." After South Carolina Senator <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strom_Thurmond_a5db.html" title="Strom Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> switched his allegiance to the Republican Party in 1964, BJU faculty members became increasingly influential in the new state Republican party, and BJU alumni were elected to local political and party offices. In 1976, candidates supported by BJU faculty and alumni captured the local Republican party. Although this take over was a short-term disaster, by 1980 the religious right and the "country club" Republicans had joined forces.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[48]</a></sup> From then on, most Republican candidates for local and statewide offices sought the endorsement of Bob Jones III and greeted faculty/staff voters at the University Dining Common.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>National Republicans soon followed. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> spoke at the school in 1980, although the Joneses supported his opponent, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Connally_4e90.html" title="John Connally">John Connally</a>, in the South Carolina primary. (Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as "a traitor to God's people" for choosing <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H.W._Bush_6cdf.html" title="George H.W. Bush">George H.W.

Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president.)<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[50]</a></sup> In the 1990s, Reagan was followed by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Quayle_b44e.html" title="Dan Quayle">Dan Quayle</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Gramm_36be.html" title="Phil Gramm">Phil Gramm</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dole_1dcc.html" title="Bob Dole">Bob Dole</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Keyes_43a9.html" title="Alan Keyes">Alan Keyes</a>.

When asked by <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, "It would not be my choice." Further, when asked if he felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, "The gospel is for individuals.

<p>Strict rules govern student life at BJU. <sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[60]</a></sup> Some of these are based directly on the University's interpretation of the Bible. For instance, the 2005-06 Day Student Handbook states, "Loyalty to Christ results in separated living. Dishonesty, lewdness, sensual behavior, adultery, homosexuality, sexual perversion of any kind, pornography, illegal use of drugs, and drunkenness--all are clearly condemned by God's word and prohibited here." (13) Grounds for immediate dismissal include stealing, immorality (including sexual relations between unmarried students), possession of hard-core pornography, use of alcohol or drugs, and participating in a public demonstration for a cause the University opposes.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[61]</a></sup> Similar moral failures are grounds for terminating the employment of faculty and staff. In 1998, a homosexual alumnus was threatened with arrest if he visited the campus. <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the University frankly declares that many campus rules are biblically based only in general principle. For instance, "[T]here is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class,' but a student who wishes to esteem others more highly than himself will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students."<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
