<p>This is one of the most funniest shows to ever come from Japan.</p>
<p>Unless you're intimately connected with Japanese pop culture you won't get any of the parodies which renders the show unwatchable for anyone but the most hardcore otaku. The show seems absolutely random, has no coherent plot and is completely incoherent even from scene to scene. It's the most painfully funny show on Cartoon Network and was a good choice for localization cartoon unlike Super Milk Chan.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'M not connected with Japanese pop culture, <i>I</i> don't get a lot of the references, I'M not a "hardcore otaku", and yet <i>I</i> think it's watchable (<i>I</i> watch it in any event). Yes, it is random, but that's the whole point. Further, it's not supposed to have a "coherent plot". Anyone who takes this show too seriously is going to have problmes with it. The viewers are supposed to just sit back and enjoy the ride.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, 1. I don't take kindly to your overgeneralization of people who do watch it (like me). 2. Wikipedia isn't the place for this. You can complain about this show on an anime forum all you like, but don't bring your doom and gloom here. <i>Wakarimasu ka</i>?</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>This is one of the funniest anime's ever! Bobobo-bo and his sidekick Don Patchi are completely insane, and the poor normal girl, Beauty, is just as confused as the viewers. Bobobo-bo's acting style might be compared to Bugs Bunny in that he dresses up a lot to confuse the enemy... or just to confuse the viewers. There are obviously a lot of Japanese cultural-puns, but the show is so crazy you never really know what is going on anyways. Another similar shonen-gag anime is <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninin_Ga_Shinobuden_b482.html" title="Ninin Ga Shinobuden">Ninin Ga Shinobuden</a></p>
<p>Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo wins the internet. No, make that TWO internets. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeith%2C_evil_dude_2491.html" title="User:Keith, evil dude">Keith, evil dude</a> 03:23, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmm...I wish I knew how to improve the quality. The only reason I changed it to the new image is because of the copyright problems regarding the last one. I think the only reason the volume cover is like that is due to the info box reducing its quality...maybe we need to make it seperate from that box.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBobobo-bo_Bo-bobo_da32.html" title="Edit section: Manzai">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Manzai</span></h2>
<p>Another important component of Bobobo is the Japanese comedy style known as "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manzai.html" title="Manzai">manzai</a>", which uses a "boke" (idiot) who spouts non-sequiturs, puns, and various other jokes, while the "tsukkomi" (straight-man, sane person, etc) corrects him, scolds him, or simply draws the audiences attention to the boke's jokes.</p>
<p>In the case of Bobobo, Beauty and Heppoko-maru are the tsukkomi, while basically everyone else are the boke. "Boke" and "tsukkomi" also can mean the action the respective role performs - thus, when Bobobo says something ridiculous, this is his "boke", and when Beauty reacts to this, she is (for lack of a better explanation) "tsukkomi"-ing.</p>
<p>Characters actually refer to this outright later on in the series. At many points, Beauty and Heppoko-maru complain about there being too many places to "tsukkomi" in a particular scene. Later, the character "Gyourai Girl" appears claiming to be a "boke killer", flatly turning down and even punishing Bobobo and the others' "boke".</p>
<p>Bobobo even incorporates advanced Japanese comedy techniques like the "nori-tsukkomi", or "riding tsukkomi". In this case, the tsukkomi accepts what the boke says as nothing unusual, going along with it momentarily before suddenly yelling out in a sort of delayed tsukkomi.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>The villian traps Beauty in a giant bowl of rice. He announces that after being trapped in the rice for one hour, she will turn into a panda, and another extra is shown in the rice who has been turned into a panda.</p>
<p>After a while, Beauty begins to worry that the time is almost up. She then notices a box with a panda costume, with a sign that says "After one hour, please put this on. Thank you."</p>
<p>At this point, the show itself has presented a boke, to which Beauty would normally tsukkomi something like "What the hell?!? I have to do it myself!?"</p>
<p>However, she silently starts putting on the panda suit, posing cutely...</p>
<p>Before suddenly yelling out angrily "As if I'm gonna fall for that!"</p>
<p><br />
As illustrated, the comedic catch of the nori-tsukkomi is the sudden 180 of the tsukkomi's attitude, especially the tsukkomi acts, at first, completely opposite to what the audience is expecting. Like most Japanese comedy, tsukkomi and particularly nori-tsukkomi relies very heavily on timing, making stand-up manzai a fine art and also a very difficult one to master.</p>

<p>Hey there, anyone that's reading this. I've been adding a few things here and there to this Wikipedia entry (mostly the manga entries and the Japanese titles for the episode guide) and do have a couple things I do want to say/ask before I go further:</p>
<p>-First of all, I am sorry for putting up that Bo-bobo/One Piece thing before. I actually thought that it was real and thus thought it was worthy for the entry.</p>
<p>-Second, I am thinking of a couple quick little things here. Well one isn't too little: with all the weird side characters and such, I was sort of thinking we could have a page that briefly intros as many as possible, with maybe a direction to the main page for those on the "Main character" page...(though looking on the Japanese Wiki page, they do include a lot of them already) I was also thinking of adding Gunkan and Serviceman to the "main characters" page, but I'm not sure if their important enough...well Serviceman is a recurring character, but I do want to make sure before I add him.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say for now.</p>

<p>The show is pretty hilarious alright! I really like it too. I found video games for it in Japan, wonder if they'll come to America. Guess if the show's popular enough. My fave characters are Bo-bobo, Beauty, Gasser, Suzu, and the rest of the good guys- Eric Marin, Visitor</p>
<p>If you like it(I have only seen one episode) watch Cromartie Highschool. It is even more stupid and fun. It is rated PG, but I don't know the exact reason. There is some mild language, but still quality Japanese comic stupidity.</p>

<p>I should tell that "Bobobo" was cut off in the #76 episode, in Japan. "Parents &amp; Teachers Association" of Japan make a fuss over this "ugly, violent show" which "it shouldn't be shown to children". Besides, the show was retired from one after another Tv station, until it was just shown in central Asashi TV. Finally, the broadcaster thought it didn't worth the pain, so it ended in the 76th episode, in the middle of a new saga, "Counter-Margarita Empire". It was replaced by Gaiking.--80.103.134.89 01:35, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ugly, violent?O_o</p>

<dd>The dub still has a long way to go to get to that arc. For the time being, we're still on ep. 20, which is midway through vol. 5 of the manga.</dd>

<p>If you can post a credible reference stating episode #76 is the last episode in Japanese due to violence, then it is a fact and may go into the article. As for the other comments, whether or not Bobobo is ugly/violent/approriate/etc. is all an opinion, and should be refrained.

<dd>I watched Bobobo when I lived in Japan, and it may be rude and violent, but I think the biggest charge that you could level is that the show is meaningless and has no plot. I got tired of the show after the 5th episode - but there ARE MUCH WORSE ANIME ON TV. Like Divergence Eve? Like Hikari to Mizu no Daphne? I tell you, after the mid 90's, Japanese TV has gone downHILL! They used to have bikini-clad girls run obstacle courses for the expressed purpose of something slipping and showing some boob, not to mention carting small cannons up to people's rooms while they are a sleep and firing it in their room for comedic effect...

<dd>This sucks. I don't even read mangas. There are character after the last episode that probably app in the game. And now, they probably won't release the games in the U.S. now due to spoilers. But what i'm bent about is what will happen to the show on Toonami. They haven't did any reruns since episode 1. They're probably trying to rush the show off the air like they did with <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave_Master_554b.html" title="Rave Master">Rave Master</a>.

<dd>Actually, the most recent of the games only goes up to the "Former Maruhage Empire" arc. No games have really been made since then (unless you count <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_Superstars_e78a.html" title="Jump Superstars">Jump Superstars</a>, which does acknowledge further in the series since the Hair Kingdom has been confirmed a stage in the new game and Gaoh (who appears in Shinsetsu) is a support character). -StrangerAtaru 13:22, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well that covers the video games part of the situation. What about the series on Toonami? <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a>
<dl>
<dd>So far, nothing heads or tales has been said about the final fate of the show. As of now, all we have are the 76 episodes already animated (which we need to get back to airing, but CN is more obsessed with Toonami movies now). Whether or not more epiosdes will be created after that...so far, nothing, but who knows... -StrangerAtaru 01:15, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My Favorite character is Bobo Patchiggler. The First Time i Watched the Episode, i was confused why he talked, like Bobo, then Don Patch, Then Jelly Jiggler. It's Because the Director did'nt want to hire anymore people, so they went with the people that voiced DonPatch, and Bobo's voice sounded like itr was fused with Jelly Jiggler.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the top page is getting a bit crowded with information, so I'm starting to think of cutting it down a bit so we can stick with the primary information of the series on the main page. So I'm starting a new page for fusions (not transformations, since I'm not too sure where to put some of them since they're so minor), thinking that maybe we can do a quick comment on Bo-bobo's fusions on the main page, and then have a seperate page with the information provided, maybe even a bit further in depth with some of them.StrangerAtaru</p>

<li>OK, I already created a "Fusions" section for the site, so that's covered (outside a tiny intro on the site). Not too sure what to do with the "Transformations", since most (outside some like Ikarin Patch and Baby Gasser) are either jokes or don't really matter. But I think there should at least be one paragraph either here or in the main information about the many fusions and transformations that occur. I also agree we need to get rid of the attack names, both on the character pages here and in the "Villains" section.

<p>I just want to say this once: after all we went through regarding the transformations before (fusions too, but they have their own section), I'm trying to basically keep that section as an introduction to transformations. Regarding the examples: I want to keep them only with common transformations seen in the series (thus why we only see stuff like "Baby Gasser" and "<i>DON</i> Patch". Most of the many, many transformations in this series usually have little or no bearing to the whole scheme of things...and that's why I got rid of them. (can't say the same for Shinsetsu TF since I want to keep Shinsetsu stuff in that section) Sure I wouldn't mind either a seperate transformation section or something in the fusion section that goes in depth into the more common TF as well as some others less seen but crucial ones (like Bo-bobo Double Twin Mark II 2nd...aka "Bo-bobo of a Parallel Universe, Sort of Like His Alter Ego, maybe the Shinsetsu ones as well could go here). But for the moment, I want to stick with the basics. --StrangerAtaru 15:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

This video linked to here, is simply the Japanese opning again.

<li>In a way, Bo-bobo is still going but under a new title. Shinsetsu starts about a year after the first series, mostly has some of the original characters (Bo-bobo, Beauty and Don Patch appear from the start, Gasser/Heppokomaru and Jelly/Tennosuke a while later), and some new ones. (not going to spoil them, but they include a perverted koala, a teen who uses his tongue as a weapon, and a magical girl) But essentially, its still the same story. -StrangerAtaru 12:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Any chance of there being a "plot" section up? You know, that basically explains the events of the show/manga, possibly separated by arcs? A bunch of other manga (One Piece, Naruto, Hunter X Hunter and others) do have these, so I'm wondering if we could put it up for Bo-BoBo. Yeah, I know it's very random, but there is a plot to it and actual story arcs, so I'm wondering if making an article that gives a synopsis of the events would be a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we tried this once with a section listing what happens in the series, but it became rather trivial at some points and the Wiki people got rid of it. To tell the truth, Sawai really doesn't start doing over-arching plot arcs until the Former Maruhage arc, since most of the arcs prior (except the beginning, when its mostly Bo-bobo and Don Patch do weird stuff, freak Beauty out..and oh yeah, fight Hair Hunters) have a consistant structure of "finding out about an enemy, defeating subordiates and then beating the big boss". But I guess we can see what we can do. -StrangerAtaru 19:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jelly Jiggler was Tennosuke in the Japanese version, and Gasser was Heppokomaru. This article is a bit inconsistent with which one it calls them; it'll sometimes use the Japanese names and sometimes the English versions. Which would should we be using? I personally think we should generally use the English versions, but if referring to something only in Japan (i.e. the Japanese voice list) we should use the Japanese names. What do you think?</p>

<dd>We ought to use English names. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 01:56, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You all are right they did cancel the anime. episode 76 was the end of it. At that time we're halfway through the reverse maruhage empire. My only consollation is that every episode after The one where Giga is defeated has two parts.<i>-Running Wild Gadget</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Is Bobobo being replaced? Because after ep. 48 there where 3 movies, then 1 episode, then DBZ: Fusion Reborn, the another episode, then DBZ: Wrath of the Dragon, then 2 Zatch Bell! episodes, then 2 more Zatch Bell! episodes will come on this week, and after that week, MAR and Prince of Tennis are supposed to premire. What is Toonami doing!? <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a>
<ul>
<li>Its unknown what's going on at this point. The PoT/MAR thing does seem to be for the time being. As for Bo-bobo...some say they are in the middle of dubbing the last 26 episodes, while nothing is really certain at this point. (though personally, if Bo-bobo was going on hiatus, they should have at least finished Giga). -StrangerAtaru 13:23, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe by that time, we will finally see the 2nd opening. But if PoT/MAR comes to Toonami, then Hikaru no Go might come too. So far, they only have room for The Batman, 2 Narutos, 2 Zatch Bell!s, and One Piece. With that happening, the shows that might get blocked off are The Batman, 1 Naruto slot, 1 Zatch Bell! slot, One Piece, or Bobobo. <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the sacrifices are Bo-bobo and One Piece. For some reason, they think its more important to have Pokemon and a Naruto rerun than Bo-bobo. Wish I knew why. -StrangerAtaru 22:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe because Naruto is just as good as DBZ, and since DBZ is finished, Naruto pretty much replaced that show. But nothing is as good or as funny as Bobobo! <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a>
<ul>
<li>I don't hate Naruto, but I do think its a tad overrated and not worth everything that the web has given it. Sure I understand its the cash cow of the network for the moment, but to only have the one rerun and the new episode is a bit much: both in trying to rerun something that just aired and in limiting how often the shows air on that network. (then again, they seem to rerun their comedy crap zillions of times even after they just premiered...I wish Bo-bobo would get a weeknight attempt, but they probably don't want to do it and rather show an umpteenth rerun of some other crap.) -StrangerAtaru 03:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yeah! You're right! Bobobo should get a weeknight attempt. The same thing happend to Rave Master. The only difference is that I missed so many episodes that I lost interest. But with Bobobo, I can't afford to miss even ONE episode due to their bogus recaps where they have false lines and tell about things that really didn't happen, plus i'm taping all the episodes. <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a></li>
<li>Well it's a new year and I STIL haven't received news on Bobobo. I can't believe this! And they still had 26 more episodes to go! <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a>
<ul>
<li>Its still early in the year and they just started with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prince_of_Tennis_2231.html" title="The Prince of Tennis">The Prince of Tennis</a> (saw one episode..not sure if I'll stick with it if the next couple don't impress me) and <a href="../../../m/%C3%A4/r/M%C3%84R_ac39.html" title="MÃ„R">MÃ„R</a> (this deserves to stay on CN, but at an earlier time) Personally think that Bo-bobo will return..well not sure when, but when CN says something, we'll know. Even so, there's still the DVDs to look forwards to. (as great as the dub is, I still want to hear "Mamos Rappi"! from Tennosuke in the Bobopatch fight. -StrangerAtaru 22:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well CN hardly ever mentions Bobobo. They only did with the summer premires, and ony two mentioning of new episodes and one promo. That's about it. And BTW, i've been permenantely taping all the episode since ep. 36 (I started with ep. 16 - 35 just for wekly purposes until I learned about the show's limited fate(no thanks to the Japanese PTA)) For them to release DVDs would defeat my whole pupose of taping. Hopefully, Bobobo will come on weekly at 5:00pm or at least the DVD's won't be copy-protected. <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a></li>
<li>Its all a matter of ratings and such for CN. Like many networks, they seem to throw a bunch of shows on the air and sees what hits and what doesn't. If it isn't an immediate success, they dump it. Bo-bobo, though, does sound to me like one of those shows that isn't a huge hit but isn't a failure either. We should be grateful its lasted this long...but I feel scared that if Bo-bobo tries to go weekday, it may fail like other attempts at weekday anime recently, only to be replaced by, oh, an umpteejillionth rerun of Billy and Mandy or Foster's. (heck, I'm even scared of Naruto's latest attempt on weekdays, considering its going up against Avatar and the Nick juggernaught...don't kids ever get sick of watching the same episodes over and over!?) -StrangerAtaru 14:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, everyone, can you please try to keep the chatter to a minimum? Talk pages are for discussing improvement of the article. If you want to talk about Cartoon Network, do it at a forum somewhere else. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yeah!? Then why don't you make a site for Bobobo forums then instead of trying to rudely shutdown an important topic determining if Bobobo will be continued on CN! <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ummmm... because you two talking about it here will definitely not change the likelihood that Bobobo will return to Cartoon Network. Why don't you go find a forum to complain about it there, rather than wasting Wikipedia's server space? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well you have to tell us what forum then. Anything anywhere else would be considered spam. <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKid_Sonic_a891.html" title="User:Kid Sonic">Kid Sonic</a></li>

<li>How am I supposed to know? There are thousands of forums all over the internet. Have some independence and find one yourself.
