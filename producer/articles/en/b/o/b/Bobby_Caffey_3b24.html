<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Caffey_3b24.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Bobby is a kind hearted paramedic who only wants to help people. This can lead to him being seen as "mothering" people, although he does not like to hear of this. He is very loyal to his friends and family, and listens to partner Kim's problems - although there are times when he wants someone to talk to rather than listen to. He was deeply religious, and also liked to box.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Caffey_3b24.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Bobby was born in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. Bobby's father left the family when he was a youngster and died many years later. The relationship did not really recover. Bobby was devoted to his family - his mother, three sisters and older brother Matteo (Matty). Matty fell into using drugs, so despite being the younger of the 2 Caffey siblings, Bobby became the "man of the family". Bobby always thought it was his fault that his father left. His mother later remarried and the whole family adopted the last name "Caffey".</p>
<p>His best friend was Paulie Fuentas, who would go on to play a major role in Bobby's life in the future. Bobby credited his high school teacher with saving him from going down the same route as Matty and Paulie - later on in life he repaid the debt by helping euthanise her to die peacefully.</p>
<p>Bobby was a paramedic, working at the firehouse in the 55th Precinct. Bobby had been a paramedic for a number of years, working with <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Zambrano_41e0.html" title="Kim Zambrano">Kim Zambrano</a> for the past 6 years. Bobby had had a crush on Kim since the day they met. When he finally reveleaed his feelings for Kim, she turned him down, saying he was too good for her and she'd let him down in the end. They did have a one night stand, which resulted in Kim dumping Bobby. However, the two did recover from this and remained friends. Bobby got on well with Kim's son Joey, and often had to put up her rants about ex-husband <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Doherty_c6de.html" title="Jimmy Doherty">Jimmy Doherty</a>, who in many ways was Bobby's rival. Bobby also had a short relationship with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Taylor_%28Third_Watch_character%29_848b.html" title="Alex Taylor (Third Watch character)">Alex Taylor</a>.</p>
<p>Bobby was seen as one of the nicest guys around, often helping out anyone in need no matter what the situation. A 13 year old girl, named Sunny, was being pimped out, and both Bobby and Kim tried to help her out. Sunny stole Kim's wallet in return, causing Bobby to go and get the wallet back from her - and giving her pimp a bruising at the same time. Unfortunately, Sunny died some time later.</p>
<p>Bobby tried to help his brother Matty out numerous times. In 2000 Matty was released from jail, and due to Mrs Caffey wanting nothing to do with him, he ended up staying with Bobby. When Matty was involved in a store robbery which ended up with the cashier getting killed, Bobby gave Matty $500 and told Matty that if he took the money, he didn't want to ever hear from him again. Matty would be dead to him. But if he turned himself in, Bobby would do everything he could to make sure Matty didn't do time. He'd wait for his brother until he was let out. Matty decided not to turn himself in, breaking Bobby's heart. It was this incident that led to Bobby and Kim's one night stand.</p>
<p>Bobby met his end near the end of the second season. An old girlfriend of his, Gina (whom Bobby had lost his virginity to many years earlier) came to him asking for him to help out her brother, Paulie - Bobby's childhood friend. Paulie was involved with drugs, and when Bobby had seen Paulie after a number of years, Paulie was passed out. Perhaps feeling guilty after failing to help his brother, Bobby took Paulie to the hospital and offered to Paulie the chance of entering rehab. Paulie denied. Later that night, Paulie went by Bobby's, feeling sick. Bobby helped his friend on condition that Paulie enter rehab. The next day, Bobby got the call that his mom's apartment had been robbed. When he found out Paulie had been the one to rob his mom's house, he went into a fury and went to Paulie's place where he confronted Paulie. Bobby threw Paulie's stash of drugs into a toilet, but ended up getting shot in the heart by Paulie. Despite the doctors' best efforts, Bobby passed away. He made peace with his father en route to heaven.</p>
