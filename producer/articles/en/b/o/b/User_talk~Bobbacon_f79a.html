<p>I like the templates you have made, but I think <a href="../../../r/e/l/Template%7EReligious_places_of_worship_in_Aberdeen_85a9.html" title="Template:Religious places of worship in Aberdeen">this one</a> is a bit too ambitious - there must be at least 100 churches and buildings of religious significance in Aberdeen. It would be hard to decide which ones to keep in a template, only those which were <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notable</a> for whatever reason should be on the template. <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 17:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, its funny since i was thinking the same thing yesterday though couldn't decide- since you've brought it up also i have changed it. As for the other templates I have created: for the parks template I was thinking of taking out the parks that don't have links , since there are about 50 in the city.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think i will leave the schools as the list is full and looks fine in its present state. Also since <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Aberdeen_c80d.html" title="List of schools in Aberdeen">List of schools in Aberdeen</a> has been changed so that it "meets wikipedia guidelines" and no longer is a complete list I think it would be useful to leave them in place. Let me know if you think any differently <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 18:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I would agree on the parks front, probably best to keep the city parks (i.e. the ones that the council run) plus the Links and Cruickshank. I think the school tempates are fine. I've had more thoughts about the churches template and I think it's probably not really needed since there is a category for <a href="../../../r/e/l/Category%7EReligion_in_Aberdeen_ad0b.html" title="Category:Religion in Aberdeen">Religion in Aberdeen</a> and the template is now very small. I suppose, the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Aberdeen_and_Orkney_6c86.html" title="Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney">Anglican</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Aberdeen_89a1.html" title="Diocese of Aberdeen">Catholic</a> dioceses, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbytery_of_Aberdeen_8cc6.html" title="Presbytery of Aberdeen">Presbytery of Aberdeen</a> plus the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Aberdeen_and_Orkney_b770.html" title="Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney">Anglican</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Aberdeen_21ae.html" title="Bishop of Aberdeen">Catholic</a> bishops and obviously the three cathedrals could be used if the templete were to become more of a "Religion in Aberdeen" template. What would probably be good for Aberdeen would be a generic <a href="../../../a/b/e/Template%7EAberdeen_907f.html" title="Template:Aberdeen">Template:Aberdeen</a>, in a similar ilk to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Template%7EGlasgow_3a02.html" title="Template:Glasgow">Template:Glasgow</a>, as the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> article is now quite long and should probably be split. <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 20:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I don't have time today, but tomorrow when I have the chance I will at least start <a href="../../../a/b/e/Template%7EAberdeen_907f.html" title="Template:Aberdeen">Template:Aberdeen</a> (unless you want to begin it first) and once complete I will put it into the main Aberdeen article replacing all the other templates. I will also take a look at the parks template. The religion template is quite small now to be justified as a template in its own right. I will take a look at the different sections of religion in Aberdeen that you have provided links for tomorrow and have a think as to what would be better. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 20:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have created <a href="../../../a/b/e/Template%7EAberdeen_907f.html" title="Template:Aberdeen">Template:Aberdeen</a>. As the religion is included in this, I think there is no longer a need for <a href="../../../r/e/l/Template%7EReligious_places_of_worship_in_Aberdeen_85a9.html" title="Template:Religious places of worship in Aberdeen">Template:Religious places of worship in Aberdeen</a> so if there is agreement I will tag it for deletion. Otherwise I can change it to a Religion in Aberdeen, but I don't think this will be necessary until there are many more articles than the few currently covered churches. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 11:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I'm not sure where it came from originally, but it definitely needs/needed a citation (I can't find find anything on Google). I will see what I can find about other demographics because having looked at the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> article today I've noticed it has details ranging from pregnancy rates to its placement on a run down areas of Scotland list. I found these interesting so I'm going to look through their references and see what I can find. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 17:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These projection figures need to be taken with a pinch of salt. One of the reasons that a downturn in population is projected is because analysts are predicting a major reduction in North Sea oil production by 2024. However, many oil related companies are increasing their presence in Aberdeen. Aberdeenshire's population is predicted to increase in the same timescale so it could be just a case of people predicted to move out of the city into the country.

<dd>I think therefore it would be best to remove these (which I have done). The source is arguably a good one (the General Register for Scotland) but I agree with you- especially since I have been reading recently that a lot of companies are building research centres which have to potential to keep a lot more people in the city than projected as the oil begins to dwindle. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 14:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you asked me to include the IPA for "Aberdeen" into the article. Theoretically I'd be able to do that, the problem is just that I'm not a native speaker of English, let alone Scots.&#160;:D So, though I *think* I pronounce the name about right, I'm not sure if I say it really correctly. You might want to try find someone who speaks Scots and knows about IPA.&#160;:) â <a href="../../../n/-/t/User%7EN-true_dbda.html" title="User:N-true">N-true</a> 15:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do you need done? Do you need it in an Aberdonian/Scottish accent? Doric? Generic English?</dd>
<dd>I'm going to say, for the moment, something along the lines of /abÉdin/ (<a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_53ec.html" title="SAMPA">SAMPA</a>: /ab@`din/), but don't take that as set in stone or anything. In an English accent, for example, it would be /Ã¦bÉdiËn/ (<a href="../../../s/a/m/SAMPA_53ec.html" title="SAMPA">SAMPA</a>: /{b@di:n/), or thereabouts.</dd>
<dd>Does that help?</dd>

<dd>any time. I can't say, however, that I actually know the difference between Doric and Aberdonian, except that it's between the "English" language and the "Scots" language. But I've never lived in Aberdeen; I'm from Edinburgh and I'm currently living in England.

Very amusing! I'm not sure that Cagulus is advocating the use of american english though, perhaps some obscure celtic dialect! I think he is joking anyway. I recently contributed to a discussion about this issue on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wollstonecraft_e830.html" title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> talk page. User Awadewit, whose efforts resulted in the promotion of the article to FA status, seems to be having a hard time accepting the consensus that biographies conform to the spelling of the subject's nationality. She believes that as she wrote the article it should stay in the american style, despite the guidelines being stated in order of importance; nationality taking precedence over the language of the original contributer. I do think that it is important that these guidelines are adhered to, especially for high profile featured articles. I know american editors would not tolerate 'corrections' to the spelling of american biographies. I think that Awadewit is being disrespectful to our culture and language by trying to impose her view and as an academic she ought to know better. Perhaps you might like to visit the talk page and put in your two pennies worth.

<dd>Quite probably. It used extensively in infoboxes for other countries. I researched other infoboxes for the Scotland infobox. The other two that cropped up a lot were the regional Vehicle Licensing codes and Population densities. In the US infoboxes, Elevation appears a lot, but I can't find data readily for in the UK so didn't include in the Scotland one. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 12:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I intend to start work in template space as soon as the current discussions are over (so as not to muddy the already murky waters!). I'm genuinely surprised and made a little sad by some of the things that are coming out at the moment, I didn't have any idea there was such UK resentment or that it could manifest itself in the way it has done.

<dd>Aside from resentment issues, the UK infobox has been one of the best collaborative projects I've been involved in. As you say, the way it had developed has been incredible and from a good range of editors. Its a shame that such an open and exciting process has been derided as if it were clandestine and divisive.

<p>Hello, I have deleted three templates you created solely to support your user page. This is not an appropriate use of the template namespace. You can certainly use the inline image syntax on your user page to render those flags at 22x20 pixel size, but please refrain from adding templates that will not be used in any mainspace articles.

<dl>
<dd>The template namespace is not intended to be a place to "give them a chance" to be used. Templates are intended to replace multiple occurances of similar wikicode on multiple pages to improve maintainability. I took a look at each of the flag images first to see how often they were rendered in the main article space:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/a/Image%7EB%C3%A9arn_flag.svg_4732.html" title="Image:BÃ©arn flag.svg">Image:BÃ©arn flag.svg</a> â no usage in <i>any</i> namespace</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/b/i/Image%7EIbiza_flag.png_12f6.html" title="Image:Ibiza flag.png">Image:Ibiza flag.png</a> â four instances in main namespace, only <i>one</i> of which was icon size</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mallorca.svg_66b3.html" title="Image:Flag of Mallorca.svg">Image:Flag of Mallorca.svg</a> â two instances in main namespace, <i>neither</i> of which is icon size</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As you can see, there is no compelling reason to clutter the template namespace if there are no instances where they will be used. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 14:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
