He has cut hundreds of records and played in numerous bands with many international rock legends. He is regarded by critics as an important figure in the configuration of early British rock and roll, although he is often chiefly remembered for his long term association as the drummer with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a> and The Playboys.</p>
<p>Clarke was the first drummer in Europe, and quite possibly the first rock drummer in the world to use a double bass drum kit with special pedals, long before <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_Baker_0ef4.html" title="Ginger Baker">Ginger Baker</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Moon_5784.html" title="Keith Moon">Keith Moon</a>.

<p>Clarke originally learned to play as a teenager with Eric Delaney (born 2.5.1924, in Acton, West London), a jazz artist who was popular in England in the 1950’s. By 1958 he shifted to the flourishing rhythm and blues, and rock scene, joining Vince Eager’s Beat Boys, comprised of Tony Belcher (guitar), Alan Le Claire (born Alan Cocks, 26.8.1938, in Dulwich, South-east London) (piano), and Tex Makins (born Anthony Paul Makins, 3.7.1940, in Wembley, Middlesex) (bass), and performing at the London coffee bar “the 2 I’s”. Vince Eager was born Roy Taylor, 4.6.1940, in Lincoln, Lincolnshire (ex The Harmonica Vagabonds, The Vagabonds Skiffle Group, Vince Eager and the Quiet Three).</p>
<p>With the addition of guitarist Big Jim Sullivan (born James George Tomkins, 14.2.1941, at Uxbridge Hospital, Uxbridge, Middlesex), The Beat Boys for a time became <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Wilde_d62b.html" title="Marty Wilde">Marty Wilde</a>’s Wildcats, recording three tunes “High School Confidential”, “Too Much” and “Mean Woman Blues”. Subsequently, the same band again became The Beat Boys, backing up <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Fury_cdfc.html" title="Billy Fury">Billy Fury</a>.</p>

<p>In about 1958 Bobbie met 21-year-old <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a> who was brought to the UK from America by his brother in law, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Barbera_c31a.html" title="Joe Barbera">Joe Barbera</a> who had hit it big in the cartoon industry with his company Hanna/Barbera. At that time, rock and roll was experiencing phenomenal growth and American rockers were in high demand in England. Concerts starring <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Vincent_a7f2.html" title="Gene Vincent">Gene Vincent</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cochran_b49e.html" title="Eddie Cochran">Eddie Cochran</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_a641.html" title="Bill Haley">Bill Haley</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comets_12c5.html" title="The Comets">the Comets</a> (referred to collectively as the American Invasion), played to crowds of UK teenagers in sold out halls.</p>
<p>Clarke and his band became Vince Taylor’s Playboys comprised of Kenny Pavell (guitar), Clive Powel (piano), and Tex Makins (bass). Clive Powell later became notable as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgie_Fame_c421.html" title="Georgie Fame">Georgie Fame</a>. When Kenny Pavel left the band to play for <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Richard_d0cb.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a>'s <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drifters.html" title="Drifters">Drifters</a>, he was replaced for a while by 16-year-old <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a>, future guitarist of <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>.</p>
<p>In 1959, their first records, “I Like Love” and “Right Behind You Baby” were released by Parlophone. On August 19th 1960, Palette Records Ltd. released “I'll Be Your Hero” and the famous ”Jet Black Machine” that stayed in the charts 9 weeks and reached the top 15. The single might have been a bigger hit, but UK teenagers of the time, under the influence of the media, were guided to listen to a more 'clean' cover of the tune by <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Richard_d0cb.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a> and his band The Shadows.</p>

<p>With help from his brother in law, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a> opened up a club in London called “The Top Ten” where the band performed. Meanwhile, his unpredictable attitude, caused several arguments with the band and they began looking for another singer, changing their name to “The Bobbie Clarke Noise”. The Noise consisted of Tony Harvey (guitar), Alan LeClare (piano), Johnny Vance (bass) and Bobbie Clarke (drums).</p>
<p>The Noise was booked to play at the prestigious Olympia in Paris on July 7th and 8th 1961. The top of the bill was Wee Willie Harris. The other artists were Duffy Power, Dave Sampson, Vince Eager, and Nero and the Gladiators, which contained lead guitar player Tony Harvey. Despite their differences, Vince was still friends with the band and asked, considering that he had never been to France, if he could come to Paris with his friends and if necessary, sing for free.</p>

<p>Vince dressed up for the occasion in his black leather gear and added a chain around his neck with a Joan of Arc medallion he had bought on arrival at Calais. He gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check that even the band was amazed, and the organizers decided to put Vince Taylor and his Playboys at the top of the Bill for both shows. As a result of Vince's exciting performance and his interaction with the band at those two shows <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Barclay_2986.html" title="Eddie Barclay">Eddie Barclay</a> signed the group to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.</p>
<p>Sorry! The real reason Vnce topped the Olympia bill was because he agreed to dress up in his leather stage gear for press photos on our arrival at Paris Norde Station at 6.00pm. The promoter John Murray said that whoever dressed up in their stage gear for a press shoot on arrival would top the bill. Vince was the only one to volunteer. A smart move. His photo was across all the Parisian newspapers on that, and the following day. If you would like more iinfo on that Parisian visit why not purchase my forthcoming biog, "Vince Eager's Rock n' Roll Files". <a href="http://www.vinceeager.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.vinceeager.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.vinceeager.co.uk</a></p>
<p>For the next two years, Bobbie Clarke with his band, once again called Vince Taylor and his Playboys (Vince Taylor et ses PlayBoys) toured Europe including The French Riviera, Brussels, Belgium, Spain, and The Netherlands in between recording several LP albums and numerous 45 RPM singles, at Barclay Studios in Paris, such as “Sweet Little Sixteen”, “C’mon Everybody”, “Twenty Flight Rock”, “Love Me”, “Long Tall Sally”, “So Glad You’re Mine”, “Baby Let’s Play House”, “Lovin Up A Storm” to name a few.</p>

<p>In 1963 Bobbie Clarke left Vince and became the drummer for <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Hallyday_9e3e.html" title="Johnny Hallyday">Johnny Hallyday</a>’s Golden Stars, resulting in three Eps released that year. During that time, Bobbie Clarke and the Golden Stars also recorded the single “Memphis Tennessee” with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a>, that was released by Barclay under the title of "Vince Taylor and The Playboys".</p>

<p>In 1964 Clarke recorded the first “It’s Not Unusual”, a demo tape with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Jones_%28singer%29_8063.html" title="Tom Jones (singer)">Tom Jones</a>. He reformed The Noise, and with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a> played as the opening act for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> on their first concert in France, at the Olympia.</p>
<p>In 1965, The Bobbie Clarke Noise was regarded by many as the finest rock band operating in France. Barclay released a single under the name “Vince Taylor with Bobbie Clarke’s Noise”, “My Babe” b/w “Trouble”. The Noise at that time were: Ralph Danks (guitar), Johnny Taylor (guitar), Bobbie Clarke (drums), Stanislas “Stash” Klossowski (Percussion), and Alan Bugby (bass) who just finished playing with Ralph Danks in the Gladiators, and with Johnny Taylor’s Strangers (3 Eps on Vega label in 62/63). In mid 1965, with several bookings lined up, Vince Taylor went AWOL and the band finally gave up. Johnny Taylor joined a religious movement. Ralph Danks left to play guitar with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Dog_Night_8a3e.html" title="Three Dog Night">Three Dog Night</a>, and later <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Jones_%28singer%29_8063.html" title="Tom Jones (singer)">Tom Jones</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. "Stash" Klossowski, a close friend of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> would later produce The Dirty Strangers album featuring <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Richards_53f8.html" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wood_a652.html" title="Ron Wood">Ron Wood</a>.</p>

<p>In late 1965, Stash and Bobbie moved to Hollywood where Bobbie replaced drummer Don Conka on several studio sessions. The line-up he joined, happened to be the original members of the band <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_%28band%29.html" title="Love (band)">Love</a>, consisting of Don Conka (drums), <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_MacLean_75a4.html" title="Bryan MacLean">Bryan MacLean</a> (rhythm guitar), Johnny Echols (lead guitar) and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Forssi_7b08.html" title="Ken Forssi">Ken Forssi</a> (bass), with the addition of <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Flaherty_e52f.html" title="Vince Flaherty">Vince Flaherty</a> (vocals, harmonica). At the same time the band was recording with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Flaherty_e52f.html" title="Vince Flaherty">Vince Flaherty</a>, they were also playing at a club called Bido Lito’s with their leader <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Lee_f44e.html" title="Arthur Lee">Arthur Lee</a>, but had not yet obtained a record deal of their own. Two of the recordings, “The Groove” and “Why”, also included, in addition to the Love line up, with Clarke as drummer, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Dragon_61b4.html" title="Daryl Dragon">Daryl Dragon</a> (Organ), later notable with The Captain and Tennille, as well as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Wright_3cd5.html" title="Charles Wright">Charles Wright</a> (rhythm guitar), future founder of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. An EP from the sessions was later released on the Verve label entitled “Vince and The Invincibles”.</p>
<p>In 1966 Bobbie Clarke also played with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>, and cut a record with a band called "The Elves Themselves", augmented by members from <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_%28band%29.html" title="Love (band)">Love</a> and a guitarist named <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>. Unfortunately, Clarke’s career in the US was cut short when he was busted for pot and garnered the rock and roll mantle of being the first UK musician to be deported. It is said that Love showed up at the deportation hearing and told the judge that Clarke would have employment as their drummer if the court would allow him to stay. That didn't help.</p>

<p>In 1967 Clarke returned to France and reformed "The Noise" with bass player Dave Curtis (ex lead singer of The Tremors), and guitarist Brian Griffiths, and once again gave it a go, with frontman <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Taylor_bf63.html" title="Vince Taylor">Vince Taylor</a>. In 1968 guitarist <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritchie_Blackmore_e101.html" title="Ritchie Blackmore">Ritchie Blackmore</a> asked Clarke to join a new band called Roundabout (which later became known as <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Purple_eeae.html" title="Deep Purple">Deep Purple</a>). Bobbie brought with him Dave Curtis. Clarke and Curtis became dissatisfied with the style of the music and left to form a new band of their own with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Howe_%28guitarist%29_676e.html" title="Steve Howe (guitarist)">Steve Howe</a> (later to join the band <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yes_%28band%29.html" title="Yes (band)">Yes</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbie_Clarke_927e.html" title="Edit section: Bodast">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bodast</span></h2>
<p>This new band, named Bodast (after the first two letters of their three first names), was an evolution from the first incarnation of <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Purple_eeae.html" title="Deep Purple">Deep Purple</a>, and the ashes of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Howe_%28guitarist%29_676e.html" title="Steve Howe (guitarist)">Steve Howe</a>’s popular psychedelic band Tomorrow. They bridged the difficult period between the psychedelic pop of 1967 and the progressive/heavy rock of 1970. John Newey, for RPM, a division of Cherry Red Records, describes their music as: “…rich in past echoes of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollies_a38f.html" title="The Hollies">the Hollies</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Move_8060.html" title="The Move">the Move</a> and Tomorrow yet pointing the way ahead to the might of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>.”</p>
<p>Between May 1968 and mid 1969, Bodast produced an entire self titled album for MGM Records. In February 1969, The <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Beck_5473.html" title="Jeff Beck">Jeff Beck</a> Group’s drummer was fired and upon Beck’s request Bobbie took his place, and did a few gigs at the Marquee in London, but was obligated to get back to work with Bodast, although Beck had expected him to stay with his group. Unfortunately for Bodast, their label MGM Records folded and the album was not released until 1981. The last gig for Bodast was in 1968 when they opened for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> and were the backing band for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a> at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Albert_Hall_a74f.html" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. Thereafter, Clarke rejoined <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Hallyday_9e3e.html" title="Johnny Hallyday">Johnny Hallyday</a> in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1971-72 he formed The Bobbie Clarke Connection, consisting of: Eddie Ayers (vocals), Jack Moriarty (lead guitar), Tony Harvey (rhythm guitar), James Byrne (bass), Stash Klossowski (percussion) and Bobbie Clarke (drums). They rehearsed and cut demos at Barclay studios in Paris and narrowly missed being signed to the label. The Connection performed live on French TV and then toured Europe, crumbling during the tour in Spain.</p>
