<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chisso.html" title="Chisso">Chisso Corporation</a> first opened a chemical factory in Minamata in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan's chemical industry, branching out into production of <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetylene.html" title="Acetylene">acetylene</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetaldehyde.html" title="Acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetic_acid.html" title="Acetic acid">acetic acid</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_chloride.html" title="Vinyl chloride">vinyl chloride</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octanol.html" title="Octanol">octanol</a>, among others. The Minamata factory became the most advanced in all Japan, both before and after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata_Bay_0b9f.html" title="Minamata Bay">Minamata Bay</a> in the factory <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wastewater.html" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a>. Inevitably these pollutants had an environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches and in response Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The rapid expansion of the Minamata factory spurred on the local economy and as Chisso prospered, so did Minamata. This fact, combined with the lack of other industry, meant that Chisso had great influence in Minamata. At one stage over half of the tax revenue of Minamata City authority came from the Chisso Corporation and its employees. Chisso and its subsidiary companies were responsible for creating a quarter of all jobs in Minamata.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Minamata was even dubbed Chisso's "castle town", in reference to the capital cities of feudal lords who ruled Japan during the <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edo_period.html" title="Edo period">Edo period</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Chisso Minamata factory first started acetaldehyde production in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, producing 210&#160;tons that year. By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> production had jumped to 6,000&#160;tons per year: over 50% of Japan's total output. The <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_reaction.html" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reaction</a> used to produce the acetaldehyde used <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury%28II%29_sulfate_9ecb.html" title="Mercury(II) sulfate">mercury sulfate</a> as a catalyst. A side reaction of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalytic_cycle.html" title="Catalytic cycle">catalytic cycle</a> led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methyl_mercury.html" title="Methyl mercury">methyl mercury</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> This highly <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic.html" title="Toxic">toxic</a> compound was released into Minamata Bay from the start of production in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> when this production method was discontinued.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, a five-year-old girl was examined at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chisso.html" title="Chisso">Chisso Corporation</a>'s factory hospital in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata%2C_Kumamoto_7080.html" title="Minamata, Kumamoto">Minamata</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, a town on the west coast of the southern island of <a href="../../../k/y/%C5%AB/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB.html" title="Kyūshū">Kyūshū</a>. The physicians were puzzled by her symptoms: difficulty walking, difficulty speaking and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convulsions.html" title="Convulsions">convulsions</a>. Two days later her younger sister also began to exhibit the same symptoms and she too was hospitalised. The girl's mother informed doctors that her neighbour's daughter was also experiencing similar problems. After a house-to-house investigation eight further patients were discovered and hospitalised. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, the hospital director reported to the local public health office the discovery of an "<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> of an unknown disease of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_nervous_system.html" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a>", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In order to investigate the epidemic, the city government and various medical practitioners formed the Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">奇病対策委員会</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Kibyō Taisaku Iinkai</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span> at the end of May, 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infectious_disease.html" title="Infectious disease">contagious</a> and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Unfortunately, this contributed to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_stigma.html" title="Social stigma">stigmatisation</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During their investigations the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patient's homes. From around 1950 onwards cats had been seen to have <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convulsions.html" title="Convulsions">convulsions</a>, go mad and die. Locals called it the "cat dancing disease", owing to their erratic movement. Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_University_0fc8.html" title="Kumamoto University">Kumamoto University</a> to help in the research effort.</p>
<p>The Kumamoto University Research Group was formed on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">August 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata regularly and admitted patients to the university hospital for detailed examinations. Gradually a more complete picture of the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptoms.html" title="Symptoms">symptoms</a> exhibited by patients was uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paresthesia.html" title="Paresthesia">numbness</a> in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing and swallowing. In general these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convulsions.html" title="Convulsions">convulsions</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a> and eventually death. By October 1956, 40 patients had been discovered, 14 of whom had died: an alarming <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortality_rate.html" title="Mortality rate">mortality rate</a> of 36.7%.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Researchers from <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_University_0fc8.html" title="Kumamoto University">Kumamoto University</a> also began to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were clustered in fishing hamlets along the shore of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata_Bay_0b9f.html" title="Minamata Bay">Minamata Bay</a>. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staple_food.html" title="Staple food">staple food</a> of victims was invariably <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shellfish.html" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a> from Minamata Bay and the cats in the local area, who tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foodborne_illness.html" title="Foodborne illness">food poisoning</a>, with contaminated fish and shellfish the prime suspects.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a> the research group announced their initial findings: "[Minamata disease] is rather considered to be poisoning by a heavy metal... presumably it enters the human body mainly through fish and shellfish."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>As soon as the investigation identified a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metal</a> as the causal substance, the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wastewater.html" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> from the Chisso plant was immediately suspected as the origin. The company's own tests revealed that its wastewater contained more than ten <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">poisonous</a> substances including <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28element%29.html" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manganese.html" title="Manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenic.html" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selenium.html" title="Selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thallium.html" title="Thallium">thallium</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnesium_oxide.html" title="Magnesium oxide">magnesium oxide</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_oxide.html" title="Potassium oxide">potassium oxide</a>. Identifying which particular poison was responsible for the disease proved to be extremely difficult and time consuming. During the years <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> many different theories were proposed by different researchers. Initially <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manganese.html" title="Manganese">manganese</a> was thought to be the causal substance due to the high concentrations found in fish and shellfish and in the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Organ (anatomy)">organs</a> of the deceased. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thallium.html" title="Thallium">Thallium</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selenium.html" title="Selenium">selenium</a> and a multiple contaminant theory were also proposed but it was not until March <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, when visiting <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurologist.html" title="Neurologist">neurologist</a> Douglas McAlpine suggested that Minamata <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptom.html" title="Symptom">symptoms</a> resembled those of <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_compound.html" title="Organic compound">organic</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_poisoning.html" title="Mercury poisoning">mercury poisoning</a>, that the focus of the investigation centred on mercury.</p>
<p>In February <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> the mercury distribution in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata_Bay_0b9f.html" title="Minamata Bay">Minamata Bay</a> was investigated. The results shocked the researchers involved. Large quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish and <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sludge.html" title="Sludge">sludge</a> from the bay. The highest concentrations were centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in Hyakken Harbour and decreased going out to sea, clearly identifying the plant as the source of contamination. At the mouth of the wastewater canal a figure of 2&#160;<a href="../../../k/g/_/Kg.html" title="Kg">kg</a> of mercury per <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton.html" title="Ton">ton</a> of sediment was measured: a level which would be economically viable to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mine</a> (indeed, Chisso did later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury from the sludge).</p>
<p>Hair samples were taken from the victims of the disease and also from the Minamata population in general. In patients the maximum mercury level recorded was 705&#160;<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parts_per_million.html" title="Parts per million">ppm</a> (parts per million), indicating very heavy exposure and in non-symptomatic Minamata residents the level was 191&#160;ppm.

The Chisso factory and its wastewater routes</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the investigation by researchers at <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_University_0fc8.html" title="Kumamoto University">Kumamoto University</a>, the causal substance had been identified as a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metal</a> and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and in order to deflect criticism the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wastewater.html" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> output route was changed. Chisso knew the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the Minamata disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish at the mouth of the river, and from that point on new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiranui_Sea_7958.html" title="Shiranui Sea">Shiranui Sea</a>, as the pollution spread over an even greater area.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chisso failed to co-operate with the investigation team from <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_University_0fc8.html" title="Kumamoto University">Kumamoto University</a>. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup> The Chisso factory's hospital director, <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajime_Hosokawa_5a7b.html" title="Hajime Hosokawa">Hajime Hosokawa</a>, established a laboratory in the research division of the plant to carry out his own experiments into Minamata disease in July 1959. Food to which factory <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wastewater.html" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> had been added was fed to healthy cats. 78 days into the experiment cat 400 exhibited symptoms of Minamata disease and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological.html" title="Pathological">pathological</a> examinations confirmed a diagnosis of <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_compound.html" title="Organic compound">organic</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_poisoning.html" title="Mercury poisoning">mercury poisoning</a>. The company did not reveal these significant results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to undermine the conclusions of the <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_University_0fc8.html" title="Kumamoto University">Kumamoto University</a>'s research into organic mercury, Chisso's Executive Director Oshima put forward a theory of dumped military <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosives.html" title="Explosives">explosives</a> contaminating the bay. Investigators looked into the theory, discovered it to be untrue and stated that it was "contrary to the facts and ignored basic rules of medical science." Chisso and other parties with a vested interest that the factory remain open (including the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry_c210.html" title="Ministry of International Trade and Industry">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</a> and the Japan Chemical Industry Association) encouraged research into alternative possible causes of the disease, other than its own waste. Professor Raisaku Kiyoura proposed <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amines.html" title="Amines">amines</a> as the cause of the disease and a paper from Professor Kikuji Tokita supported the amine theory and further hypothesised that eating rotten fish might be the source. These papers, from research was supported by Chisso and the JCIA, were not regarded highly by the medical and scientific community, although they caused much excitement in the press and confusion among victims and their families.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>Polluting wastewater had damaged the fisheries around Minamata ever since the opening of the Chisso factory in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. The <b>Minamata Fishing Cooperative</b> had managed to win small payments of "sympathy money" (<i>mimaikin</i>) from the company in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> and again in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, but after the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation was becoming critical. Fishing catches had declined by 91% between the years <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>. The prefectural government issued a partial ban on the <i>sale</i> of fish caught in the heavily polluted <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata_Bay_0b9f.html" title="Minamata Bay">Minamata Bay</a> but not an all-out ban, which would have force it to properly compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on <a href="../../../6/_/a/6_August_df1b.html" title="6 August">6 August</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a>, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor Todomu Nakamura to mediate between the two sides but this committee was stacked heavily in the company's favour. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> the fishing cooperative agreed to the committee's proposal, stating: "In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept". The company paid the cooperative <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>20 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>55,600) and set up a <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>15 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>41,700) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.</p>

Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory</div>

</div>
<p>Since the change of route of wastewater output in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, pollution had spread up and down the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiranui_Sea_7958.html" title="Shiranui Sea">Shiranui Sea</a>, damaging fisheries there too. Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the <b>Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives</b> also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a>, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory and delivered their demands to factory manager Eiichi Nishida. When this produced no results the alliance members took their campaign to <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_of_Japan_d12a.html" title="Diet of Japan">Diet</a>. During the visit on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">2 November</a> alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>10 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>27,800) worth of damage. The violence was covered widely in the media, bringing the nation's attention to the Minamata issue for the first time since the outbreak began. Another mediation committee was set up, an agreement hammered out and signed on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">17 December</a>. <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>25 million "sympathy money" was paid to the alliance and a <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>65 million fishing recovery fund.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, the victims of Minamata disease were in a much weaker position than the fisherman. The recently-formed <b>Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society</b> was much more divided than were fishermen. Patients' families were the victim of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostracism.html" title="Ostracism">ostracism</a> by the local community. Local people felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin. To some patients this ostracisim by the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. After beginning a <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sit-in.html" title="Sit-in">sit-in</a> at the factory gates in November <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> the patients asked <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumamoto_Prefecture_15c9.html" title="Kumamoto Prefecture">Kumamoto Prefecture</a> Governor Hirosaku Teramoto to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. Chisso and the mediation committee agreed and after a few weeks' further negotiation, a "sympathy money" agreement was signed. Patients who were certified by a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Health_and_Welfare_d693.html" title="Ministry of Health and Welfare">Ministry of Health and Welfare</a> committee would be compensated: adult patients received <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>100,000 (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>278) per year; children <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>30,000 (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>83) per year and families of dead patients would receive a one-off <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>320,000 (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>889) payment.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> Chisso was ordered by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry_c210.html" title="Ministry of International Trade and Industry">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</a> to switch back its wastewater drainage from the Minamata River to Hyakken Harbour and to speed up the installation of wastewater treatment systems at the factory. Chisso duly installed a Cyclator purification system on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, and opened it with a special ceremony. Chisso's president Kiichi Yoshioka dared to drink a glass of water supposedly treated through the Cyclator to demonstrate that it was safe. In fact, the wastewater from the acetaldehyde plant, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not treated through the Cyclator at the time. The stunt was an outright deception. Testimony at a later <a href="../../../n/i/i/Niigata_Minamata_disease_9ba0.html" title="Niigata Minamata disease">Niigata Minamata disease</a> trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: "...the purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury."<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The deception was wholly successful and almost all parties involved in Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> on. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems in the years to follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds the issue of Minamata disease had been "resolved".</p>

<p>The years between the first set of "sympathy money" agreements in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and the start of the first legal action to be taken against Chisso in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> are often called the "ten years of silence". In fact, much activity on the part of the patients and fishermen took place during this period but nothing had a significant impact on the actions of the company or the coverage of Minamata in the national media. The Minamata Fishing Cooperative, unhappy with their original settlement, attempted to negotiate a new agreement with Chisso. Lacking any local or political support and with divisive splits in their membership, they ultimately failed.</p>

<p>Despite the almost universal assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> had no effect on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread.

The highest result recorded was that of a lady from Goshonoura island who had 920 <a href="../../../p/p/m/Ppm.html" title="Ppm">ppm</a> in her sample.</p>
<p>The prefectural governments did not publish the results and did nothing in response to these surveys.

<p>Local doctors and medical officials had noticed for a long time that there was an abnormally high frequency of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebal_palsy.html" title="Cerebal palsy">cerebal palsy</a> and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> a number of medical professionals including <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masazumi_Harada_8fe0.html" title="Masazumi Harada">Masazumi Harada</a> (later to receive an <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_500_Roll_of_Honour_b86d.html" title="Global 500 Roll of Honour">honour from the United Nations</a> for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children who had been diagnosed with cerebal palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the outbreak was discovered in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time it was believed that the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placenta.html" title="Placenta">placenta</a> served to protect the <a href="../../../f/o/e/Foetus.html" title="Foetus">foetus</a> from toxins, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methylmercury.html" title="Methylmercury">methylmercury</a>: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the foetus.</p>
<p>After several years of study and the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsies.html" title="Autopsies">autopsies</a> of two children, the doctors announced that they were suffering from an as yet unrecognised <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital.html" title="Congenital">congenital</a> form of Minamata disease.

</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Minamata disease broke out again in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, this time along the banks of the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agano_River_eac7.html" title="Agano River">Agano River</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/i/Niigata_Prefecture_eedc.html" title="Niigata Prefecture">Niigata Prefecture</a>. The polluting factory (owned by <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showa_Denko_fa51.html" title="Showa Denko">Showa Denko</a>) was the second-largest <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetaldehyde.html" title="Acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>-producing factory in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and employed a chemical process using a <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28element%29.html" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalyst.html" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a>, very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> to the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, cats living along the banks of the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long patients were discovered with identical symptoms to patients living on the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiranui_Sea_7958.html" title="Shiranui Sea">Shiranui Sea</a>, and the outbreak was made public on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">12 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and Dr. <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajime_Hosokawa_5a7b.html" title="Hajime Hosokawa">Hajime Hosokawa</a> (who had retired from Chisso in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second Minamata disease.</p>
<p>Unlike the patients in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, only three years after discovery.</p>
<p>The events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. Masazumi Harada has said that, "It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible."<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Around this time two other pollution-related diseases were also grabbing headlines in Japan. Victims of Yokkaichi asthma (caused by sulphur oxides emitted by a <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrochemical.html" title="Petrochemical">petrochemical</a> complex) and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Itai-itai_disease.html" title="Itai-itai disease">Itai-itai disease</a> (caused by <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadmium.html" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> poisoning in <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyama_Prefecture_9972.html" title="Toyama Prefecture">Toyama Prefecture</a>) were forming citizen's groups and filed lawsuits against the polluting companies in September <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and March <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> respectively. Collectively these diseases came to be known as the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Big_Pollution_Diseases_of_Japan_2d7f.html" title="Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan">Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Slowly but surely the mood in Minamata and Japan as a whole was shifting. Minamata patients found the public gradually becoming more receptive as the decade wore on. This culminated in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> with the establishment in Minamata of the <b>Citizens' Council for Minamata Disease Countermeasures</b> which was to become the chief citizens' support group to the Minamata patients. A founding member of the citizens' council was Michiko Ishimure, a local <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housewife.html" title="Housewife">housewife</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a> who later that year published <i>Pure Land, Poisoned Sea</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">苦海浄土―わが水俣病</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Kugai Jōdo: Waga Minamatabyō</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span> a book of poetic essays that received national acclaim.</p>

<p>Early in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> a group of six Niigata Minamata disease patients and supporters visited Minamata and on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">24 January</a> the Niigata Victims' Association and the Minamata Mutual Aid Society, together with their citizens' support groups, issued a statement of solidarity: "We realise that the Kumamoto and Niigata incidents are one... the only path to the elimination of industrial pollution is for the people of polluted areas to unite and fight together." The groups jointly petitioned the national government to issue an official conclusion about the cause of the diseases and to provide support for the victims.</p>

<p>Finally on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, twelve years after the discovery of the disease (and four months after Chisso had stopped production of acetaldehyde using its mercury catalyst), the government issued an official confirmation of the cause of Minamata disease:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Minamata disease is a disease of the central nervous system, a poisoning caused by long-term consumption, in large amounts, of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The causative agent is methyl mercury. Methyl mercury produced in the acetaldehyde acetic acid facility of Shin Nihon Chisso's Minamata factory was discharged in factory wastewater... Minamata disease patients last appeared in 1960, and the outbreak has ended. This is presumed to be due to the fact that consumption of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay was banned in the fall of 1957, and the fact that the factory had waste-treatment facilities in place from January 1960."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The conclusion contained many factual errors: eating fish and shellfish from other areas of the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiranui_Sea_7958.html" title="Shiranui Sea">Shiranui Sea</a>, <i>not just</i> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minamata_Bay_0b9f.html" title="Minamata Bay">Minamata Bay</a>, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, <i>as well as</i> large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time could also cause the disease; the outbreak had not in fact "ended" in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by "those above" (<i>okami</i>). The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>In light of the government announcement, the patients of the mutual aid society decided to ask for a new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">6 October</a>. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> with unfortunate results. At a meeting on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">5 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the <b>Arbitration Group</b> (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the <b>Litigation Group</b> (who decided to sue the company). That summer Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litigation.html" title="Litigation">litigation</a>.</p>

<p>An arbitration committee was duly set up by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Health_and_Welfare_d693.html" title="Ministry of Health and Welfare">Ministry of Health and Welfare</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">25 April</a>, but it took almost a year to draw up a draft compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>2 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>5,600) for dead patients and <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>140,000 to <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>200,000 (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>390 to <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group felt completely betrayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The arbitration committee announced their compensation plan on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">25 May</a> in a disorderly session at the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Health_and_Welfare_d693.html" title="Ministry of Health and Welfare">Ministry of Health and Welfare</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. Thirteen protestors were arrested. Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the Ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a>. Payments for deaths ranged from <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>1.7 million to <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>4 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>4,700 to <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>11,100), one-time payments from <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>1 million to <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>4.2 million (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>2,760 to <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>11,660) and annual payments of between <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>170,000 and <a href="../../../j/p/y/JPY_0d22.html" title="JPY">JPY</a>380,000 (<a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>470 to <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing the Minamata citizens' council held a protest outside the Minamata factory gates and one of the Chisso <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_unions.html" title="Trade unions">trade unions</a> held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by the company.</p>
<p>The litigation group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their suit against Chisso in the Kumamoto District Court on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">14 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. The leader of the group, Eizō Watanabe (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared that, "Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against the power of the state". The litigation group and their lawyers were helped substantially by a informal national network of citizens' groups that sprung up around the country in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>.

<p>The first wave of compensations, settled in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, could not be maintained as new cases of Minamata disease began to appear. These victims and their families were not included in the original settlement with Chisso and therefore did not receive the same compensation as those diagnosed before the original solution. So the newly diagnosed families began the quest to receive comparable compensation for their disabilities. One group chose to sue Chisso and therefore go to trial for their compensation; another group sought direct negotiations with the executives of Chisso.</p>
<p>These direct negotiations in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> were exhausting. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a>, Kawamoto, a leader in the direct negotiations group, began by asking Shimada, a Chisso executive, to pledge in their blood to come to an agreement and treat each other as human beings. Shimada refused. The negotiations lasted through much of the night, ending with Shimada collapsing and being taken to the hospital. The Minamata patients were told to go home, and when Shimada was able to negotiate again, he would do so in Minamata. However, the patients remained in the Chisso headquarters. By <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, only two patients remained in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, Kawamoto and Sato. Chisso Executive Director Kuga, approached them and asked them to take some money and buy tickets back to Minamata. Kawamoto and Sato refused unless Chisso agreed to direct negotiations. They were thrown out to the unsightly tented settlement outside the building.</p>
<p>After this, protests and speeches by the patients took place outside the Chisso office building. Media coverage was great and many journalists took the side of the Minamata victims. Patients were shown in wheelchairs at the protests and in newspapers. However, the stalemate remained.</p>
<p>Patients and sympathizers marched on the downtown offices of Chisso and attempted to march as far as the president’s office. They were met with iron bars blocking the door to the Chisso floor of the Tokyo Building. The patients used the bars to their advantages by building memorials to the people who had already died of Minamata disease.</p>
<p>Because of the mass of media coverage, the Japanese <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Communist_Party_f200.html" title="Japanese Communist Party">Communist</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Socialist_Party_55fe.html" title="Japan Socialist Party">Socialist</a> parties began to more openly support the sufferers of Minamata disease along with the <a href="../../../s/o/h/Sohyo.html" title="Sohyo">Sōhyō</a> labour federation. The attention of the media and political party officials allowed Minamata disease to become a widely known problem in Japan and because the minority population of Minamata disease sufferers then had a voice, it then allowed Japanese democracy to develop to a new level. Also, due to this open support by opposing parties, and the call from the labour union for Chisso to negotiate, the Japanese government stepped into action with the Director General of the Environmental Agency (Oishi Buichi) asking to be allowed to mediate the negotiations.</p>
<p>Also around this time, Governor Sawada Issei came to Tokyo to help in overcoming the impasse of negotiations. Sawada and Oishi both met with the patients, Kawamoto and Sato, and also with Shimada, who had returned from the hospital. Both parties agreed to mediate negotiations through Sawada and Oishi.</p>
<p>As the negotiations began, the patients opposed a settlement mirroring the first solution. They wanted not only equal and sufficient compensation but also public acceptance by Chisso of responsibility for the Minamata disease.</p>
<p>During these negotiations and also talks of a compensation advance, 29 more patients were diagnosed with Minamata disease. These patients were more cooperative with Chisso and agreed to accept the low compensation of $570 each. This caused a split between the newly diagnosed families. It also took away much of the leverage the direct negotiation group had and gave Chisso an advantage. The division between the Tokyo group and the Minamata group brought up hard feelings. Those in Minamata had continued to work, while the protestors in Tokyo had received financial support from backers in Tokyo. Many of those in Minamata were facing continued discrimination, but also were being threatened of losing their jobs if they continued with the negotiations. Only four people ultimately decided to drop the negotiations.</p>
<p>The patients reduced their demands to close to what the first settlement between Chisso and the original Minamata victims had been. However, Chisso still refused because of the lack of a ranking system for the severity of illness. Then the negotiations were officially suspended, owing to Chisso’s unwavering stance.</p>
<p>Finally, the trial verdict came down in favour of the patients. The District Court found Chisso guilty of corporate negligence and ordered Chisso to pay $66,000 for each patient who had already died, between $59,000 and $66,000 for surviving patients, coming to a total of $3.44 million.</p>
<p>This gave the direct-negotiation patients grounds to reach agreements. After days of negotiation, Chisso agreed to pay $66,000 for deceased patients who were included in the group of newly diagnosed patients. This opened the door for the other newly diagnosed patients to be included in the trial settlement. Finally, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, through the work of the new Environment Agency Director Miki, an agreement was reached. This proposal included the compensations based on ranking severity of symptoms, but also payments to the patients per year to cover living expenses, and payment of all medical expenses. The government also provides medical examinations for people living in the affected area. These compensations and actions are considered inadequate by many.</p>

<p>As of March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, 2,265 victims have been officially certified (1,784 of whom have died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they were not recognised as official victims.<sup id="_ref-numbers_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-numbers" title="">[1]</a></sup> The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated as a full <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiological_study.html" title="Epidemiological study">epidemiological study</a> has never been conducted and patients were only ever recognised if they voluntarily applied to a Certification Council in order to seek financial compensation.<sup id="_ref-Guardian1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Guardian1" title="">[22]</a></sup> Many victims of Minamata disease faced <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostracism.html" title="Ostracism">ostracism</a> from the local community if they came out into the open about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contagious.html" title="Contagious">contagious</a> and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on it for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere sufferers were understandably reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the Council for certification.<sup id="_ref-Soshisha10things_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soshisha10things" title="">[23]</a></sup> Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the Certification Council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. As such the Council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a Council of medical recognition, the decisions of the Council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that some of the people who sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease.<sup id="_ref-Soshisha10things_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Soshisha10things" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo12345_Minamata_disease_02ea.html" title="Edit section: Democratizing effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Democratizing effects</span></h2>
<p>According to Timothy S. George, the environmental protests that surrounded the disease appeared to aid in the democratization of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. When the first cases were reported (or more accurately suppressed) the victims had no rights and were given no compensation. Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease; people were afraid that it was contagious.</p>
<p>The people directly impacted by the pollution of Minamata Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees were excluded from the debate. Progress occurred when Minamata victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step towards democracy. One reason may be because after Japan's defeat in World War II, the factory was part of the new <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zaibatsu.html" title="Zaibatsu">zaibatsu</a> that was determined to be more important to the livelihoods of its poorest citizens.</p>
<p>Through the evolution of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.</p>
<p>Although the environmental protests did result in Japan being more democratized, it did not completely rid Japan of the system that first suppressed the fishermen and victims of Minamata disease.</p>

<p>Photographic documentation of Minamata started in the early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> was <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shisei_Kuwabara_0b45.html" title="Shisei Kuwabara">Shisei Kuwabara</a>, straight from university and photo school. The first exhibition of his work in Minamata was held in the <a href="../../../f/u/j/Fujifilm.html" title="Fujifilm">Fuji</a> Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies <i>Minamata</i> was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.</p>
<p>However, it was a dramatic photographic essay by <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Eugene_Smith_9e3a.html" title="W. Eugene Smith">W. Eugene Smith</a> that brought world attention to Minamata disease. He and his Japanese wife lived in Minamata from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomoko_Uemura_in_Her_Bath_77c1.html" title="Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath">Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath</a></i>, (1972) shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a bath. Tomoko was poisoned by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methyl_mercury.html" title="Methyl mercury">methyl mercury</a> while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the cooperation of Ryoko and Tomoko in order to dramatically illustrate the consequences of the disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, and therefore does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works.<sup id="_ref-Tomoko_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tomoko" title="">[24]</a></sup> Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichihara.html" title="Ichihara">Ichihara</a> city, near <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world.<sup id="_ref-Smith1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smith1" title="">[25]</a></sup> The 54 year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>.</p>

<p>Minamata disease remains an important issue in contemporary Japanese society. <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuits.html" title="Lawsuits">Lawsuits</a> against Chisso and the prefectural and national governments are still continuing and many regard the government responses to date as inadequate.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>Most congenital patients are now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating. Their parents, who are often their only source of care, are into their seventies or eighties or already deceased. Often these patients find themselves tied to their own homes and the care of their family, in effective isolation from the local community. Some welfare facilities for patients do exist. One notable example is <b>Hot House</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">ほっとはうす</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Hotto Hausu</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, a vocational training centre for congenital patients as well as other disabled people in the Minamata area.
