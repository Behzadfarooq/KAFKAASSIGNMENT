<p>It says that Bob hosted ToC for 18 years and then moved on to TPIR in 1972. That means he would have had to host two shows simultaneously from 1972 to 1974.

<p>It's fine to have a mention of Bob's 80th birthday on a Million Dolalr Spectacualr, but why the entire paragraph on it? And what does the 6000th show have to do with Barker? Also, it says in one paragraph that The Price Is Right celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2002, yet on another paragraph below it says "That same year", and mentioned the 6000th show, which was in 2004. Wikider 22:55, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I assume I'm breaking wikipedia rules by trying to broadcast my message in this way, but here goes. Somebody really needs to fix that lawsuit section. It should be proofread and split into paragraphs or totally removed.</p>
<p>I completely rewrote the lawsuit section, trying to strip it down to the bare essentials and keep as much of a neutral POV as possible. I understand that Hallstrom's lawsuit was reactivated by a court in 2004, but I can't find out any information about it, save that she supposedly won "millions" from her case. As I had no good info, I did not include Hallstrom's victory. -- Cincgreen, 17 March 2006</p>

<dd>Wow...I didn't even realize that this was originally posted back in April.

<p>First of all, to TPIRFanSteve and the anon, please discuss what you want to do here, not in edit summaries or on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#User:TPIRFanSteve" title="WP:AN">the administrator's noticeboard</a>. Secondly, I actually side with the anon here. The fact is, lots could happen between now and June. For one thing, Bob is almost 83 years old. There is a decent chance that he could have significant health problems or even pass away between now and June 2007, in which case the end of his run as host might be earlier than June 2007. The article already says that he is scheduled to leave in June. That's good enough for now, I think. We can't definitely state when his last show will be until he has that last show. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 10:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've readded the date with a caveat of "(announced)". Based on a few other pages, that seems to be the standard procedure for this sort of thing, as opposed to just leaving the end date blank. -<a href="../../../t/p/i/User%7ETPIRFanSteve_1d5f.html" title="User:TPIRFanSteve">TPIRFanSteve</a> 16:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a bit better, but I still think it should just have the end date blanked. It is mentioned quite a bit anyway in his article and in the show's article, and there is a possibility that he may get sick or die in the next year, you never know. And what if he reconsiders and wants to do another season? Not likely, but not totally out of the question. I'm not going to mess with it for awhile, but since he technically is still the current host of the show, it should just be left open, until we can be certain that his last show has aired. And I'd like to see where it is "standard procedure" to put announced dates for the end dates, cause I am not finding anything. 68.79.132.216 19:43, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to argue the case here, but I have friends who talk to the show's staff on a regular basis...and he's NOT going to reconsider retiring. -<a href="../../../t/p/i/User%7ETPIRFanSteve_1d5f.html" title="User:TPIRFanSteve">TPIRFanSteve</a> 00:40, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't matter, in my personal opinion, I believe Bob. But saying that third-hand information is valid is pretty faulty. I still think on the basis that he is still the current host, and that the proposed ending date is a long ways off (and fairly vague), and the possibility that Bob could have health problems or such, it should just be left open. 68.79.132.216 04:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand why you would think that third-hand information might be invalid, but you need to consider the source here. The staff of Golden-Road.net is well-known in the game show community for having connections with Price's staff, and the webmasters talk to the show's producer on the phone several times a month. (I'm not making any kind of argument here for what is or isn't acceptable for Wikipedia -- just trying to lay out where I'm coming from.)</dd>

<dd>As for the end date, I'm not going to change it one way or the other at this point. I don't want to get into an extended pissing match over this, and I think you and I could probably both accomplish a lot more here if we're not constantly shouting at each other, anyway. I tend to jump at drastic changes to these articles, because they usually result in a lot of inaccuracies, but most of the alterations you've made in the last few days actually <i>are</i> valid. -<a href="../../../t/p/i/User%7ETPIRFanSteve_1d5f.html" title="User:TPIRFanSteve">TPIRFanSteve</a> 05:19, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
