<p>He was born near <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosse%2C_Texas_ce9e.html" title="Kosse, Texas">Kosse, Texas</a> to Emma Lee Foley and John Tompkins Wills;<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> his father was a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_styles_%28violin%29.html#Fiddle" title="Musical styles (violin)">fiddle</a> player who along with his grandfather, taught the young Wills to play the fiddle and the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandolin.html" title="Mandolin">mandolin</a>. After several years of drifting, "Jim Rob," then in his 20s, attended barber school, got married, and moved first to <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy%2C_New_Mexico_c345.html" title="Roy, New Mexico">Roy, New Mexico</a> then to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey%2C_Texas_ca53.html" title="Turkey, Texas">Turkey, Texas</a> (now considered his home town) to be a barber. He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth%2C_Texas_7bf1.html" title="Fort Worth, Texas">Fort Worth</a> to pursue a career in music. It was there that while performing in a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine_show.html" title="Medicine show">medicine show</a>, where he learned comic timing and some of the famous "patter" he later delivered on his records, the show's owner gave him the nickname "Bob."</p>
<p>In Fort Worth, Wills met Herman Arnspinger and formed The Wills Fiddle Band. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html" title="The 1930s in country music">1930</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Brown_1699.html" title="Milton Brown">Milton Brown</a> joined the group as lead vocalist and brought a sense of innovation and experimentation to the band, now called the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_Crust_Doughboys_0e00.html" title="Light Crust Doughboys">Light Crust Doughboys</a> due to radio sponsorship by the makers of Light Crust Flour. Brown left the band in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html#1932" title="The 1930s in country music">1932</a> to form the Musical Brownies, the first true <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_swing.html" title="Western swing">Western swing</a> band. Brown added twin fiddles, tenor <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjo.html" title="Banjo">banjo</a> and slap bass, pointing the music in the direction of swing, which they played on local <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancehalls.html" title="Dancehalls">dancehalls</a>.</p>
<p>Wills remained with the Doughboys and replaced Brown with new singer <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Duncan_bf44.html" title="Tommy Duncan">Tommy Duncan</a> in 1932. He found himself unnable to get along with future Texas Governor <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Lee__Pappy__O%27Daniel_94a0.html" title="W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O'Daniel">W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel</a>, the authoritarian host of the Light Crust Doughboy radio show. O'Daniel had parlayed the show's popularity into growing power within Light Crust Flour's parent company, Burrus Mill and Elevator Company and wound up as General Manager, though he despised what he considered "hillbilly music." Wills and Duncan left the Doughboys in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html#1933" title="The 1930s in country music">1933</a> after Wills had missed one show too many due to his sporadic drinking.</p>
<p>Wills recalled the early days of what became known as Western swing music, in a 1949 interview.<a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2003/honkytonks/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2003/honkytonks/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "Here's the way I figure it. We sure not tryin' to take credit for swingin' it." Speaking of Milt Brown and himself working with songs done by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Davis_2f4c.html" title="Jimmie Davis">Jimmie Davis</a>, the Skillet Lickers,<a href="http://www.southernmusic.net/gidtanner.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.southernmusic.net/gidtanner.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Rodgers_%28country_singer%29_8a03.html" title="Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)">Jimmie Rodgers</a>,<a href="http://www.jimmierodgers.com/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jimmierodgers.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and others, and songs he'd learned from his father, he said that "We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance catagory. It wouldn't be a runaway, and just lay a real nice beat behind it an the people would get to really like it. It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' to not have to repeat so much."</p>
<p>After forming a new band, "The Playboys", and relocating to <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco%2C_Texas_3edc.html" title="Waco, Texas">Waco</a>, Wills found enough popularity there to decide on a bigger market. They left Waco in January of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html#1934" title="The 1930s in country music">1934</a> for <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_ee0e.html" title="Oklahoma City">Oklahoma City</a>. Wills soon settled the renamed "Texas Playboys" in <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulsa%2C_Oklahoma_75c3.html" title="Tulsa, Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>, and began broadcasting noontime shows over the 50,000 watt <a href="../../../k/v/o/KVOO_1779.html" title="KVOO">KVOO</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio station</a>. Their 12:30-1:15 Monday-Friday broadcasts became a veritable institution in the region. Nearly all of the daily (except Sunday) shows originated from the stage of <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain%27s_Ballroom_2929.html" title="Cain's Ballroom">Cain's Ballroom</a>. In addition, they played dances in the evenings, including regular ones at the ballroom on Thursdays and Saturdays. By <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html#1935" title="The 1930s in country music">1935</a> Wills had added <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horn_section.html" title="Horn section">horn</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed.html" title="Reed">reed</a> players and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a> to the Playboys. The addition of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_guitar.html" title="Steel guitar">steel guitar</a> whiz Leon McAuliffe in March, 1935 added not only a formidable instrumentalist but a second engaging vocalist. Wills himself largely sang <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> and sentimental <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballads.html" title="Ballads">ballads</a>.</p>
<p>With its <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> sophistication, pop music and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> influence, plus improvised <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scats.html" title="Scats">scats</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisecrack.html" title="Wisecrack">wisecrack</a> commentary by Wills (something he learned clowning in those earlier medicine shows), the band became the first <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstar.html" title="Superstar">superstars</a> of the genre. Milton Brown's tragic and untimely death in 1936 had cleared the way for the Playboys.</p>
<p>Wills' 1938 recording of "Ida Red" served as a model for Chuck Berry's decades later version of the same song - <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maybellene.html" title="Maybellene">Maybellene</a><a href="http://www.famoustexans.com/bobwills.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.famoustexans.com/bobwills.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1536306/07132006/wills_bob.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1536306/07132006/wills_bob.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> . In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940_in_country_music.html" title="1940 in country music">1940</a> "New San Antonio Rose" sold a million records and became the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signature_song.html" title="Signature song">signature song</a> of The Texas Playboys. The song's title referred to the fact that Wills had recorded it as a fiddle instrumental in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1930s_in_country_music.html#1938" title="The 1930s in country music">1938</a> as "San Antonio Rose". By then, the Texas Playboys were virtually two bands: one a fiddle-guitar-steel band with rhythm section and the second a first-rate <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> able to play the day's <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_%28genre%29.html" title="Swing (genre)">swing</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> hits as well as <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixieland.html" title="Dixieland">Dixieland</a>.</p>
<p>In 1940 Wills, along with the Texas Playboys, co-starred with Tex Ritter in “Take Me Back to Oklahoma”. Other films would follow. In late 1942 after several band members had left the group, and as World War II raged , Wills joined the Army, but received a medical discharge in 1943. <a href="http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/WW/fwi45.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/WW/fwi45.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/wills_bob/bio.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/wills_bob/bio.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<p>After leaving the Army in 1943 Wills moved to Hollywood and began to reorganize the Texas Playboys. He became an enormous draw in Los Angeles, where many of his Texas, Oklahoma and regional fans had also relocated during World War II.</p>
<p>He commanded enormous fees playing dances there, and began to make more creative use of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_guitar.html" title="Electric guitar">electric guitars</a> to replace the big horn sections the Tulsa band had boasted. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944_in_country_music.html" title="1944 in country music">1944</a> the Wills band included twenty-three members. <a href="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> While on his first cross-country tour, he appeared on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Ole_Opry_b36d.html" title="Grand Ole Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a> and was able to defy that conservative show's ban on having drums onstage.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_country_music.html" title="1945 in country music">1945</a> Wills' dances were out drawing those of Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman <a href="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobwills.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and he had moved to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresno%2C_California_418c.html" title="Fresno, California">Fresno, California</a> then in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947_in_country_music.html" title="1947 in country music">1947</a> he opened the Wills Point nightclub in <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a> and continued touring the Southwest and Pacific Northwest from Texas to Washington State.</p>
<p>During the postwar period, <a href="../../../k/g/o/KGO_%28AM%29_ff2c.html" title="KGO (AM)">KGO</a> radio in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> syndicated a <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Wills_%26_His_Texas_Playboys_0cc0.html" title="Bob Wills &amp; His Texas Playboys">Bob Wills &amp; His Texas Playboys</a> show recorded at the Fairmont Hotel. Many of these recordings survive today as the Tiffany Transcriptions, and are available on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">CD</a>. They show off the band's strengths significantly, in part because the group was not confined to the three-minute limits of 78 rpm discs. They featured superb instrumental work from fiddlers Joe Holley and Jesse Ashlock, steel guitarists Noel Boggs and Herb Remington, guitarists Eldon Shamblin and <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Barnard_c513.html" title="Junior Barnard">Junior Barnard</a> and electric mandolinist-fiddler <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Moore_6470.html" title="Tiny Moore">Tiny Moore</a>. The original recorded version of Wills's "Faded Love," appeared on the Tiffanys as a fairly swinging instrumental unlike the ballad it became when lyrics were added in 1950.</p>
<p>Still a binge drinker, Wills became increasingly unreliable in the late 1940s, causing a rift with Tommy Duncan (who bore the brunt of audience anger when Wills's binges prevented him from appearing). It ended when he fired Duncan in the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_in_country_music.html" title="1948 in country music">1948</a>.</p>

<p>Having lived a lavish lifestyle in California, in 1949 Wills moved back to Oklahoma City, then went back on the road to maintain his payroll and Wills Point. An even more disastrous business decision came when he opened a second club, the Bob Wills Ranch House in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>. Turning the club over to what was later revealed as dishonest managers left Wills in desperate financial straits with heavy debts to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</a> for back <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a> that caused him to sell many assets including, mistakenly, the rights to "New San Antonio Rose." It wrecked him financially.</p>
<p>In 1950 Wills had two Top Ten hits, "Ida Red Likes the Boogie" and "Faded Love". He continued to tour and record through the 1950s into the early 1960s, despite the fact that Western Swing's popularity even in the Southwest, had greatly diminished. Even a 1958 return to KVOO where his younger brother Johnnie Lee Wills had maintained the family's presence, did not produce the success he hoped for. He kept the band on the road into the 1960s. After two heart attacks, in 1965 he dissolved the Texas Playboys (who briefly continued as an independent unit) to perform solo with house bands. While he did well in Las Vegas and other areas, and made records for the Kapp label, he was largely a forgotten figure — even though inducted into the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum_2af3.html" title="Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum">Country Music Hall of Fame</a> in 1968. A 1969 stroke left his right side paralyzed, ending his active career.</p>

<p>Wills' musical legacy, however, endured. His style influenced performers <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Owens_7bcf.html" title="Buck Owens">Buck Owens</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merle_Haggard_7015.html" title="Merle Haggard">Merle Haggard</a> and helped to spawn a style of music now known as the <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakersfield_Sound_9dbd.html" title="Bakersfield Sound">Bakersfield Sound</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakersfield%2C_California_1f16.html" title="Bakersfield, California">Bakersfield, California</a> was one of Wills' regular stops in his heyday). A 1970 <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribute_album.html" title="Tribute album">tribute album</a> by Haggard directed a wider audience to Wills' music, as did the appearance of younger "revival" bands like <a href="../../../a/s/l/Asleep_at_the_Wheel_900b.html" title="Asleep at the Wheel">Asleep at the Wheel</a> and the growing popularity of longtime Wills disciple and fan <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Nelson_7599.html" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>. By 1971, Wills recovered sufficiently to travel occasionally and appear at tribute concerts. In 1973 he participated in a final reunion session with members of some the Texas Playboys from the 1930s to the 1960s. Merle Haggard was invited to play at this reunion. The session, scheduled for two days, took place in December, 1973, with the album to be titled <i>For the Last Time</i>. Wills appeared on a couple tracks from the first day's session but suffered a stroke overnight. He had a more severe one a few days later. His musicians completed the album without him. Wills by then was comatose. He lingered until his death on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>.</p>
