<p>Bobby Kent was by many accounts, a popular athletic boy. He earned a decent grade point average in school and played sports. Bobby was charming to those around him and naturally attracted attention. His parents, Fred and Farah Kent had high aspirations for him. Fred was self-employed as a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockbroker.html" title="Stockbroker">stockbroker</a>, and believed that the true <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dream_e7af.html" title="American Dream">American Dream</a> was for one to be their own master; something he wanted for his son and had plans to set Bobby up running his own business once he graduated from college. Bobby, who was an avid car stereo enthusiast and had his own vehicle sound system that was worth several thousand dollars, had told his father that was the type of business he would like to get into.</p>
<p>He was described by Broward County prosecutor Tim Donnelly, who tried all the conspirators for his murder as "Very <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Haskell_af36.html" title="Eddie Haskell">Eddie Haskell</a> like. Adults saw him one way (polite and charming) while the kids saw him in a completely different light."</p>
<p>Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Broward County since that time, and were good friends as adults. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt "ill-will and hatred" towards Kent because Kent would <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bully</a> and pummel him. Both sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Marty's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica Puccio, were cautious because Marty often returned from being with Bobby with bruises or bleeding. Fred Kent thought of Marty as a wayward slacker who had no future (Marty was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping Bobby build.</p>
<p>Kent and Puccio had also delved into making <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">porn</a> movies in the hopes they could sell them to local shops to earn extra money. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but rather allegedly directed them and either coaxed or forced Lawrence Shafer, a Florida man in his early 40's to commit lewd acts on camera. Kent tried to peddle the movie, entitled <i>Rough Boys</i>, to porn shops across south Florida. However, none took him up on the offer due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sellable sexual activities in the film beyond Shafer dancing nude and playing with a <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dildo.html" title="Dildo">dildo</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Kent_b72d.html" title="Edit section: Murder">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Murder</span></h2>
<p>For a few weeks prior to his death, Kent dated Alice Jean Slay (Ali Willis), best friend of Puccioâ€™s girlfriend, Lisa Connelly. Willis moved back with her parents in Palm Bay, Florida, and broke up with him following Kent allegedly forcing Willis to watch a graphic homosexual porn movie while he had rough sexual intercourse with her. Kent reportedly said he was going to <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> her and smother her baby unless she returned to Broward County to date him. Willis returned and she and Connelly concocted a plan to kill Kent. The girls obtained a gun (Connelly's mother's gun which Lisa stole from her for that night) and lured Kent to a rock pit in west Broward but backed out at the last minute.</p>
<p>The plan was for Willis to seduce Kent and begin having sex with him. While this was happening, Connelly would sneak up behind Kent and shoot him. Connelly allegedly later said that she did not shoot Kent because the police can trace <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet.html" title="Bullet">bullet</a> fragments to the gun they originally came from.</p>
<p>The next day, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, a wider circle of friends conspired to kill Kent, including the newly recruited Derek Kaufman who the group heard through friends was a gang leader and mafia hitman. Prior to meeting the group, Kaufman had no association with Kent, Puccio or any other member. The group again lured Kent to the rock pit in an undeveloped area in Western Broward County, Florida (Which was at the time in the early stages of being developed as a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdivision_%28land%29.html" title="Subdivision (land)">subdivision</a>.) which is now the neighborhood of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston%2C_Florida_845c.html" title="Weston, Florida">Weston</a>.</p>
<p>Puccio had told Kent that they were going to race cars (specifically Willis' high-powered 5.0 <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a>) and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again. That night, despite blistering Florida summer heat and humidity, Puccio was dressed in black jeans, a black <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenchcoat.html" title="Trenchcoat">trenchcoat</a> and had a red bandana tied around his head. According to Willis, <i>"Marty came out of (his) house looking like <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambo.html" title="Rambo">Rambo</a>."</i></p>
<p>Sometime around midnight, Willis led Kent away from the group down by a canal that ran up against the area. Heather Swallers then was instructed by Derek Kaufman to join them and figure out if Kent suspected anything. If she felt he didn't, Kaufman told her to ask Kent if there were any <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alligator.html" title="Alligator">alligators</a> in the canal. Once she did that, the murder would commence. Swallers asked Kent if the canal had any alligators and Kent sarcastically told her she should go <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinny_dipping.html" title="Skinny dipping">skinny dipping</a> and find out for herself.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after, Donny Semenec charged Kent and stabbed him from behind in his neck. Kent whirled around and called out to Puccio for help. Puccio then stabbed him in the abdomen, and when Kent tried to flee, Semenec, Kaufman, and Puccio tackled him and stabbed and beat him. Several times during the murder, Kent pleaded and begged Puccio for mercy, telling his friend <i>"I'm sorry! Marty, whatever I did, I'm sorry!"</i> but Puccio continued. While Kent was down, Puccio cut his throat and hit his head against the ground so hard he fractured a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebrae.html" title="Vertebrae">vertebrae</a> in Kent's neck.</p>
<p>Kaufman delivered the final blow with a weighted baseball bat to the head. Kent's body was then dumped into a canal however there are conflicting reports over who did it, either Kaufman and Derek Dzvirko (Lisa's cousin who was also along) or Kaufman and Puccio.</p>
<p>Dzvirko was also the one who led Detective Frank Illaraza of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broward_County_54e8.html" title="Broward County">Broward County</a> Police Department to Kent's body a few days later.</p>

Was angry at Kent for beating and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a> Marty as well as allegedly raping her best friend, Ali Willis. Kent was also known to commonly refer to Connelly (who was overweight) as "fatass", "tatonka", "potlock" "chub" and "Shamu", often encouraging and/or forcing Puccio to do the same.</p>
<p><b>Alice Jean Slay (Ali Willis)</b> (born <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">August 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>): Kent's former girlfriend, set up with Kent by Connelly in the hopes that if he was with her, he'd leave Puccio alone. Allegedly involved in a teenage <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> ring prior to Kent's murder.</p>
<p><b>Donald Roth (Donny) Semenec Jr.</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>): Willis' boyfriend at the time of the murder. Habitual drug user. Supposedly helped in the murder because he was angry at Kent for raping his girlfriend. Struck the first blow on Kent. Murder occurred on his 18th birthday.</p>

Along with Swallers, was offered and accepted a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> in exchange for testimony that would help convict others in the group. The two were originally promised the same prison sentence, however Dzvirko got four extra years for attempting to lie on the witness stand.</p>

The member of the group deemed by the State of Florida to be the least culpable for Kent's murder. Had no participation in the murder itself and ran and hid in Willis' car once it started. Cut the same plea bargain as Dzvirko did and got the promised sentence because unlike him, she did not lie during her testimony.</p>
