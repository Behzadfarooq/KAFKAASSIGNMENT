<p>Singer is a hunter, and knew <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Winchester_5236.html" title="John Winchester">John Winchester</a>, though they had a falling out. According to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Winchester_6ba5.html" title="Dean Winchester">Dean Winchester</a>, the last time the two met Bobby almost "filled him with buckshot."</p>
<p>Dean and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Winchester_267f.html" title="Sam Winchester">Sam Winchester</a> head to Bobby's place after <a href="../../../m/e/g/Meg_Masters_a32a.html" title="Meg Masters">Meg Masters</a> has taken their father captive. From the episode "<a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Trap_%28Supernatural%29_6195.html" title="Devil's Trap (Supernatural)">Devil's Trap</a>," it can be assumed that he is somewhat of a demonology expert. He helps the brothers out by giving Sam the Key of Solomon and letting them perform an exorcism on Meg. He warns Dean before the exorcism is complete that there is still an innocent girl inside and that the fall Meg experienced in "<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28Supernatural%29_35a2.html" title="Shadow (Supernatural)">Shadow</a>" would kill her if the brothers removed the demon.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Singer_728c.html" title="Edit section: Season 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 2</span></h2>
<p>When season two begins, John asks Sam to go to Bobby and get some items on a list. At Bobby's place, Sam is told that the items are used to summon a demon. We don't see Bobby in "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Loves_a_Clown_%28Supernatural%29_aa36.html" title="Everybody Loves a Clown (Supernatural)">Everybody Loves a Clown</a>," but he is mentioned when he lets Dean and Sam stay at his place while Dean repairs the Impala. He also lets Dean and Sam borrow one of his minivans, the only one he has working, when they go to find <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Harvelle_ca89.html" title="Ellen Harvelle">Ellen Harvelle</a>. Bobby also appears in "<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_Under_a_Bad_Sign_%28Supernatural%29_06c5.html" title="Born Under a Bad Sign (Supernatural)">Born Under a Bad Sign</a>," helping Dean exorcise a possessed Sam. He then gives the brothers charms to help keep them from getting possessed.</p>
<p>Bobby Singer is one of the many hunters’ out there and was at one time a friend of John Winchester's before the two of them had a falling out and he tried to shot John Winchester full of buckshot. However despite that, Bobby helped John's sons, Dean and Sam, when they came to him for help after their father had been taken captive by Meg Masters, who turns out to be a human possessed by a demon. He helps the brothers out by giving the younger one, Sam, the Key of Solomon and letting them perform an exorcism on Meg. He warns Dean before the exorcism is complete that there is still an innocent girl inside and that the fall Meg had experienced would kill her if the brothers removed the demon. They did so and Bobby had both Sam and Dean leave before the cops showed up so there wouldn't be anymore questions about the dead girl in his living room.</p>
<p>Bobby next came to the Winchester's aid after the John, Sam, and Dean were in a car accident and he brought his tow truck to the junk yard where Dean's Impala was in pieces and was a piece of junk not worth saving. But with Sam's insistence that Dean loves that car and would want to fix it once he woke up, Bobby took the car and also a list of things that John had requested Sam to get for him. he thought it strange that John asked for items used to summon a demon; however he got them for John and took the car back to his place. The death of John Winchester was hard on his son's and so Bobby offered his place up for Sam and Dean to rest at and for a month Dean worked on his Impala and pretended as if everything was all right, though with his own perspective, he knew neither of the boys were. However he kept to of there business and he offered them the only car he had running, a minivan, so that they could check out a hunt. Afterward he saw them for a couple more days until Dean got his car running and the Winchester's were back of the road again.</p>
<p>The next run in with the Winchester's came when Sam showed up on his doorstep without his brother. Bobby knew something was wrong, just a gut feeling, and after offering a beer to same that had holy water in it, turns out he was right, and Sam was possessed by a demon and none other then Meg, the demon that they had exorcised at his place nearly six months before. After Dean arrived, they tried to exorcise the demon from Sam, but it turned out the demon had put a binding link on the arm, locking itself inside of Sam. But Bobby was quick to think, and with a hit firewood iron, he burnt the link across and broke it, releasing Sam. After everything, he gives the boys charms that fend off possession so the demon won't be taking either of them over again.</p>
<p>But his work with the Winchester Boys was far from over. They called him a couple weeks later to come to help them out on a case in Ohio. He listened to two very different tales from the two of them, hearing about a tenured professor who jumped out the window, the supposed alien abductee who was forced to slow dance, and the researcher eaten by the alligator. But the worst of it was the bickering of Sam and Dean, who were acting more like an old married couple. After hearing everything, he just shook his head, and explained to them that what was happening was a trickster, a Loki, was messing around with them, and probably getting kicks from it too. Bobby, Dean, and Sam went to the university to get rid of the trickster, supposedly they did, and they drove off.</p>
