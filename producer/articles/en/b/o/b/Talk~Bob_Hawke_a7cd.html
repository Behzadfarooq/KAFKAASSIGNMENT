<p>I need to verify Bob Hawke's world record for drinking beer in 11 seconds based on this article. Does anyone have more info and a source for this data? Thanks!</p>
<p>Not as such, but it is certainly true. He was listed in the Guinness Book of Records for many years and it was commonly reffered to in the press. Given the scrutiny of Hawke's life since he became PM, it would be astonishing to discover that it wasn;t true and no journalist had yet discovered it.&#160;!!!</p>
<p>-Total BS. 2.5 pints equals 40 ounces. A 40 oz in 11 seconds is not very fast. The Fox from the Man Show wouldv'e manhandled this fool. I could beat that record easily, I will try to document it. I suggest you delete this non-record because it isn't shit. - thrax ---</p>
<dl>
<dd>This record is extremely well known in Australia. If you claim you can do better, it's up to you to prove it. Good luck. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 08:00, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should be noted that Guinness formerly did indeed publish records for beer consumption (unsurprising, given the book's origin and sponsorhip) but ceased to accept new ones years ago for fear of being implicated in cases of severe alcohol poisoning or accused of encouraging alcohol abuse, and now seems to have ended publication of even those set prior to the ban being implemented. I, for one, accept Hawke's record as being 'legitimate' in the sense that it once had the imprimatur of Guiness, not that it necessarily represents the most prodigious consumption ever achieved. (And I don't want to be accused of tacit approval of acute alcohol intoxication, either!) <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 01:29, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was amused by the following extract from Hawke's entry:</p>
<p>"They moved to Canberra while Hawke started studying for a doctorate at the Australian National University. But Hawke abandoned the degree in 1958 when he was offered a post as research officer at the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) headquarters in Melbourne."</p>
<p>My former lecturer, Dennis, was a fellow PhD student with Hawke at ANU and tells the story of Hawke leaving the university somewhat differently. One evening Dennis was assisting with a function for Australia's Anglican Bishops that was being held at ANU when he (and all the bishops) saw Hawke and a male friend naked and drunk staggering down the lane towards them, singing a bawdy song. A number of the bishops were so shocked they dropped their tea cups. Hawke and his friend were subsequently expelled from ANU and Hawke eventually found work with the ACTU. One could argue that if Hawke continued with his PhD he wouldn't have become Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I considered adding this to his entry but thought it might be safer to include here instead.</p>

<p>129.94.6.30 insists that Hawke was the 28th prime minister. This is understandable, since Hawke is the 28th entry in a typical list of prime ministers. However, this does not take into account the fact that Deakin and Fisher will appear on the list three times, and Menzies will appear twice. It seems strange to claim that Deakin was the second, fifth and seventh prime minister. And if we are going to count Deakin as the second, fifth and seventh prime minister just because he served non-contiguous terms, then shouldn't we also count prime ministers that served multiple continugous terms as multiple prime ministers. No way. The only reasonable approach is to count them uniquely, and number them in order of first appointment. Personally, I prefer not to number them at all. The number is largely meaningless after all. But as long as a number is to appear, 23 is clearly superior to 28. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 01:30, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with 23 rather than 28 for Bob Hawke. Australia does not have an official tally of Prime Ministers, unlike the USA which does count its Presidents, and the same name can be given different numbers if the President had 2 non-consecutive terms. Americans are used to this convention, but it makes no sense to Australians to call (say) Deakin, the 2nd, and the 5th and the 7th Prime Minister. He was the 2nd person to hold the office of Prime Minister, so he is only the 2nd Prime Minister. By the same reasoning, Bob Hawke was the 23rd. If Hawke were to make a comeback and defeat John Howard (the 25th PM), Hawke would still be the 23rd PM, not the 26th. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 00:05, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All parliamentary and official documents follow the convention of not counting each PM more than once. Hawke is therefore the 23rd PM.

<p>Hawke has been referred to as the 28th Prime Minister by many sources, the fact that the National Archives does a different way of numbering does not means it is necessarily right. I mean the Prime Minister's tenure should be reflected by the times they have served in office. Menzies for example be much rather be remembered as the 21st Prime Minister (1949-66) than his unhappy time as the 16th Prime Minister (1939-41). I don't think he would like to have these two periods jumbled together to be remembered as one. This encyclopedia is not in any way affiliated with the National Archives and therefore does not need to be written according to its standards. So it is not a matter of a minority view at all but a more efficient way of conveying information. I mean it is much easier for people to count the Prime Ministers without the need to worry if he or she has already counted this Prime Minister before.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that consensus among the contributors to this page is that Hawke should be listed as the 23rd PM. I have reverted and added a footnote that explains the situation. You might like to edit the footnote to mention the alternative of 28 if counted differently. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnottygobble_bf70.html" title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:53, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I again agree with the consensus about Hawke being the 23rd not the 28th PM. I made a contribution to the debate earlier but forgot to sign it (it's there now). It is not a question of right or wrong. Americans (and some other countries) count every separate presidency, whereas Australia (and some other countries) do it the Australian way and just count the number of people who have occupied the office. Overseas, Hawke may well be referred to as the 28th Australian PM, but we ignore this numbering system in Australia, where he is always known as the 23rd PM. Surely we can make the rules about how we count our Prime Ministers (while also yielding to the different and equally valid customs other countries may have about their office-holders). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 00:05, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Counting Prime Ministers is like anniversaries. You should not hold back counting an anniversary simply because it happens to look like one that has already been done. I count the Prime Ministers from the periods they were in and not as individuals simply because each time a Prime Minister leaves office signifies how much progress has been made during his time in office. Moving one number up each time there's a change of Prime Minister represents the continuation of progress. The Treasurers are being counted in periods and not as individuals in this encyclopedia. If nothing else this encyclopedia should try to be consistent with itself. I mean why should counting the Prime Ministers be different from the counting of their Treasurers. As to the response that it's ridiculous to count Alfred Deakin three times. Would it be ridiculous to count Grover Cleveland three times as US President if he had served a third non-consecutive term?</p>
<p>I noticed in the history page that JackofOz wrote that he is the 23rd Prime Minister because we Aussies says so. I feel insulted if he applied that I am not an Aussie which I am. As a response to that I am a Aussie and I say he is the 28th.--<a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.94.6.28.html" title="User:129.94.6.28">129.94.6.28</a> 05:29, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that this separate numbering convention is used in the USA is in part because the phenomenon has been so uncommon there, in fact unique to one President, Grover Cleveland, who is probably more remembered by most students taking American history in school for being the 22nd <i>and</i> 24th Presidents than for that he stood for or accomplished. The proceedure in American states, almost all of which have had persons who served non-consecutive terms as governor, varies, but it seems to me that most follow what seems to be the consenus Austrialian convention, not that it really matters all that much.</dd>

<p>This is not an article about the history of the left. It is a passing reference in article about Hawke. But for your info, there was a "left" in the union movement, consisting of unions under the influence of the three communist parties (CPA, SPA and CPA-ML), plus various left-wing ALP unions. They supported Hawke against Nolan in 1969. But Hawke was always pro-American and pro-Israel, and soon broke with the left. This is all common knowledge and is documented in Blanche d'Alpuget's biography, which I suggest you read before making fatuous statements here. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:51, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please provide specific references to personalities that you regard as having anti-American views from this period.

If you wish to provide a reference to a specific book, kindly provide page numbers as is the normal practise when supporting a specific point. I would suggest that a personality such as the Reverand <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Walker_%28theologian%29_fdf7.html" title="Alan Walker (theologian)">Alan Walker</a> is an interesting example of a important leader of the anti-war movement, obviously <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cairns_20dd.html" title="Jim Cairns">Jim Cairns</a> is a case in point. Who were the mainstream leaders of "the left" who were anti-American, in the sense of being oppossed to the underlying economic and political system in the US?

<p>I have heard of some of these people but am not aware to what extent that they all oppossed to the underlying political and economic system of the United States. Would you be able to provide quotes from Tom Uren and Jack Mundey, for example that shows that they were thus oppossed? I note that Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Mundey_8cc2.html" title="Jack Mundey">Jack Mundey</a> does not (yet) refer to any such views. I believe that Mundey was at some stage a member of the Communist Party but am not aware of when he may have left it and also not aware the extent to which the Australian party advocated changing the American political system. Tom Uren was a WWII POW so perhaps suffered in defending at least the Australian system of government and indeed became a minister in the Whitlam government. Based on his inclusion in the list, I am increasing skeptical about the list as a whole. Are all these people really noted for anti-Americanism? I think we need to build a reference of specific quotes that indicate this. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 06:31, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Adam, you have reverted three times today but seem unwilling to provide any meaningful reference that indicates that "the left" as a cohesive whole had a pre-domintanly "anti-American" view at the time in question. I offered an alternative wording which you have summarily reverted without further discussion.</p>
<p>Please note, your link to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Crawford_02ba.html" title="George Crawford">George Crawford</a> appear to be incorrect.</p>
<p>As I have indicated, I do not accept that for example Tom Uren was anti-American in any sense of oppossing the American political system, so I am unwilling to accept your list as evidence, you need to provide a reference that gives specific information about the precise nature and extent of the alleged anti-Americanism. Without such a reference, I believe that the text as it stands is imprecise and possibly misleading. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 10:06, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, here we go: Uren, like all the people I named above, is a <b>socialist</b>. Some of them are, or were then, <b>communists</b>. The defining characteristic of socialists and communists is that they oppose <b>capitalism</b>. The US is the world's leading capitalist power. Therefore all socialists and communists oppose the US political and economic system. All socialists and communists also oppose what they call <b>US imperialism</b>, which they believe is a result of the operations of American capitalism. They considered the Vietnam War to be an imperialist war. In the 1960s, there were three communist parties in Australia, and there was also a socialist faction of the ALP, led by Cairns and Uren. They disagreed with each other about many things, but they all agreed in opposing the US and the Vietnam War. Between them, these groups controlled many trade unions - the Metal Workers, the Builders Laborers, the Seamen, the Wharfies, the Miners, the Transport Workers and most of the teachers unions. These unions formed a block in the ACTU, called <b>the left</b>. They supported Hawke for President at the 1969 ACTU Congress because they thought he was more left-wing than the other candidate, Harold Souter. This soon proved to be incorrect, but that is beside the point. These are all elementary historical facts which anyone who was around in the 60s or has read any Australian history will know. If you don't know them, you can expect to make mistakes when you try to edit Australian history articles, and when you do that you will get reverted. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:40, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Im a bit late, but still feel it is important. Your arguement is flawed. Socialism does not in any way equate to "opposing capitalism" any more than Capitalism equates too "opposing socialism", that is a major generlisation. Socialism is a term that has no specific meaning and has certainly changed over time, but generally it implies some form of democratic government that forms an *ideal* welfare state (which is also a loaded term, but please indulge me). This welfare state <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> include capitalism. Many Americans refer to Australia and many European countries as socialist countries for having free University (well hex anyway), and our version of Medicare. - <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlimitedAccess_461a.html" title="User:UnlimitedAccess">UnlimitedAccess</a> 19:31, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Not only is it invalid to suggest Socialism = Opposing Capitalism, it is also invalid to suggest Opposing Capitalism = Anti-Americanism that again is another huge generalisation. People who appose the US decisions (even consistantly) are not necessarily anti-american (even if some are). They could just disagree for sound logical reasons, or perhaps for ethical reasons, it is invalid to generalise that Socialists/People who oppose Capitalism/People who oppose (1,some,all) US decisions are anti-American. - <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlimitedAccess_461a.html" title="User:UnlimitedAccess">UnlimitedAccess</a> 19:31, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Anti-American" is in itself a loaded term and should be avoided when ever possible (particarly in an Encyclopedia). Labelling people as "anti-American" should be done <b>VERY</b> carefully and in most cases only when they label themselves as such. "Anti-American" is typically a slander, an emotive POV term used to discredit an individual and their oppinion. For example many people charge the American liberal film maker Michael Moore with being "anti-American", but that does not make it true or valid to include it on his page as a description. Of course i'm not saying you cant label people Anti-American on Wiki, it is best avoided but if you *must*, a considerable amount of care must be taken, including a a compelling amount of sources (such as flag burning, prjudicial attacks on Americans, simply for *being* American).

<p>You haven't provided any reference at all, all you have done is assert on the basis of labelling Uren as "socialist" that therefore he must be ipso facto, anti-American. I don't accept this and suggest that it is far too simple and misleading. For example I believe that in 1965, the Labor caucus, of which Uren was a member, supported a motion in Caucus with Whitlam and Calwell to support the bombing of Hanoi by the Americans in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The National Library says that Uren was "was an active member of the left wing of the ALP, maintaining opposition to the Vietnam War, conscription and nuclear testing. His chief political interests are urban affairs, the environment, veterans' affairs and security and intelligence." <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms5816" class="external autonumber" title="http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms5816" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This does not indicate that he was anti-American in the sense that you defined it, merely that he oppossed certain policies.</p>
<p>If you are able to supply specific details of anti-American statements or actions by Uren we can begin to accept that he was anti-American. It is not sufficient to claim this on the basis of your own authority. I suggest that you are unable to do this and therefore claim that your whole argument can be called into question. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 14:14, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When Keating resigned on 3 June 1991, Hawke had himself sworn in as Treasurer for one day while he decided between the rival claims of <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Willis_6fde.html" title="Ralph Willis">Ralph Willis</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerin_3c6d.html" title="John Kerin">John Kerin</a> for the job. He chose Kerin (the wrong choice, as it turned out) and he was sworn in on 4 June. It's in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Parliamentary_Handbook_6fd3.html" title="Australian Parliamentary Handbook">Australian Parliamentary Handbook</a>, 2005 edition, p742, if you need a source.

<p>Note that Hawke is included in the category of "atheists". Shouldn't there be a quote or reference, rather than the apparent assumption that this is common knowledge? He is referred to in the article as a "lapsed Protestant", which some atheists assuredly are, but the terms are hardly synonymous.

<p>Does anyone wanna add anything about Bob Hawke's government abolishing the free education system. I'm too young to know the details but I think it might be noteworthy. Also, if I recall correctly, Bob Hawke was the prime minister that abandoned recognition of China's government in Taiwan to recognition of the CCP. Any info about what his reaction was to the Tiananmen Square incident after showing support for, and working hard to improve relations with, the CCP would be quite interesting to read about as well. There's a mention at <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/02/1086058914600.html?from=storyrhs" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/02/1086058914600.html?from=storyrhs" rel="nofollow">this Sydney Morning Herald article</a> that he wept. I think I remember reading in a textbook somewhere that Australia granted refugee status to a lot of Chinese after that but again I'm too fuzzy on the details so if anyone feels like filling in the blanks I think this could all be good material for the article.</p>
