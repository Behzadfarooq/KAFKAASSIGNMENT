<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Walker_%28photographer%29_30dd.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>Walker attended <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberlin_College_8aa2.html" title="Oberlin College">Oberlin College</a>. It was at Oberlin that he made his closest friend, a mutt named <i>Dog</i>. After graduation in 1974 he drove with <i>Dog</i> across country, entering the San Francisco Bay Area through Altamont Pass whose sensual hills he would note were the cause of his love affair with California.</p>
<p>Walker’s journey as a photographer began when a friend, poet Jim Mitchell, sold Walker his first camera: a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentax.html" title="Pentax">Pentax</a> ME. Armed with his new camera, Walker traveled to the East Bay hills to capture the natural beauty of the area. <i>"I do think I can take credit for getting him interested in photography, but the East bay Hills he discovered on his own..."</i></p>
<p>Walker had one good eye and only partial use of the other. He took many of his photos in low light with very slow film, a technique that resulted in landscapes with great depth of field. He called the afternoon hour at which he took most of his best photos <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_hour_%28photography%29.html" title="Magic hour (photography)">Magic Hour</a>. This time of day allowed Walker to take advantage of the shadows and contrasting light of the sunset. The "San Francisco Bay Guardian" commented that his photos, <i>"conjure up the style of the old masters..."</i></p>
<p>Walker credited a photo taken in winter 1982 as a pivotal point in his photographic career. One stormy day he was hiking in the rain in his favorite park. The sky was completely covered with dark rain clouds above a pastoral landscape of sensual green hills, with <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Diablo_State_Park_202d.html" title="Mount Diablo State Park">Mt. Diablo</a> in the distance. Seeing the Sun beginning to break through the clouds, he quickly rushed to the top of the ridge and captured the image, <i>Winter Storm over Marsh Creek</i>. He later noted that it was the first time he envisioned a photo before it had been created.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Walker_%28photographer%29_30dd.html" title="Edit section: Activism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Activism</span></h2>
<p>When a <i>For Sale</i> sign appeared on a property some of his favorite landscape, Walker became an activist. After trying to get the attention of local officials, Walker took matter into his own hands. To save the land he loved so much, he started leading hikes into the area, giving slide shows of the landscape, and having participants write postcards to government leaders asking for support to Walker’s cause. He also brought his photos and slides to the Park District headquarters, interesting the staff and allying himself with local officials who with later hire him for a variety of projects. Eventually, the area was preserved as the first addition to Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Walker also became involved with several other activism groups including the Save Mount Diablo, Greenbelt Alliance, Preserve Area Ridgelands Committee (PARC), the East Bay Area Trails Council the Save San Francisco Bay Association, and the Sierra Club. He helped lead dozens of activist campaigns and helped create the proposed almost 800 miles of trails in the San Francisco Bay area.</p>
<p>Walker was one of the key activists in the creation of the Eastshore State Park, Pleasanton Ridge Regional Preserve, Round Valley Regional Preserve, and the connection of Morgan Territory Regional Preserve to Mt. Diablo State Park. He helped stop the proposed C&amp;H, Marsh Canyon, Garaventa and Round Valley landfills, and the proposed Buckhorn Reservoir.</p>
<p>One of Walker's proudest accomplishments was the passage of the Regional Park District' $225 million open space funding Measure AA in November 1988, enabling a vast expansion of the Regional Park District's land holdings from approximately 60,000 to more than 96,000 acres and 1,000 miles of trail in 2006.</p>

<p>Walker's favorite place was Morgan Territory Regional Preserve which he helped to more than quadruple in size. A month before his death in September 1992 the East Bay Regional Park District honored him with the naming of a section of Morgan Territory Ridge as "Bob Walker Ridge" as well as the "Bob Walker Regional Trail" both at Morgan Territory. Walker described the honor as the "proudest moment of my life."</p>
<p><i>Bob Walker Ridge</i> is a section of Morgan Territory Ridge circled on the east and west by the Volvon Loop Trail. Crowned with oaks and bays with grassland below on the west side, heavily wooded on the east side, the ridge is visible for miles. It includes views west to Highland Ridge, --much of the scene depicted in his pivotal photo <i>Winter Storm Over Marsh Creek</i>and north to Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. To the east it over looks Round Valley Regional Preserve and the Los Vaqueros reservoir and watershed, with more distant views across the defeated Marsh Canyon landfill, the new Cowell Ranch State Park, Vasco Caves and Brushy Peak Regional Preserves, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and across the Central Valley to the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p><i>Bob Walker Regional Trail</i> is also found in Morgan Territory Regional Preserve, stretching from Mt. Diablo State Park within Riggs Canyon across Highland Ridge, down into the Marsh creek drainage and back up and north around the <i>Bob Walker Ridge</i> and finally south to the Preserve main staging area. It overlays sections of the Highland Ridge Trail and the Volvon Loop Trail. Part of it is overlain by the Diablo Trail which Walker helped create.</p>

<p>For a number of years the Gay-Lesbian Activities Section of the Sierra Club maintained an endowment for a <i>Bob Walker Conservation Award</i> which it presented several times. Eventually the award was discontinued and the endowment was donated to the Oakland Museum to help fund the exhibit "After the Storm: Bob Walker and the Art of Environmental Photography" in 2001.</p>
<p>A new award was created by John Woodbury, Executive Director of the Bay Area Open Space Council, the <i>Bob Walker Bay Area Open Space Conservation Award</i> which honors an individual who brings diverse people together to advance the cause of land conservation.</p>

<p>"After the Storm: Bob Walker and the Art of Environmental Photography" was an exhibit and retrospective of Bob Walker's work held at the Oakland Museum, "The Museum of California" from <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. The exhibit was preceded by and followed by several other locations, including the San Francisco Arts Commission from <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a> - <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>.</p>
<p>Walker's photographs were exhibited many places during his life. The Oakland Museum retrospective was the first major show about both his work and his activism. Curated by Christopher Beaver, Judy Irving and Ellen Manchester of the Independent Documentary Group, the exhibit placed Walker's work in the context of the history of photography in the environmental movement, demonstrating its relationship to work of such artist/activists as Ansel Adams, Phillip Hyde, Eliot Porter, the Mono Lake Committee and Robert Dawson.</p>
<p>Several rephotographs, by Ellen Manchester and Robert Dawson, of sites photographed by Walker demonstrated the changes that have taken place in the Bay Area landscape. The exhibition also included Walker's photographic equipment, correspondence, maps, field books, scripts, and recordings of talks he presented. A resource center provided brochures and contact information for a variety of Bay Area and Northern California conservation and open space organizations.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"With the valleys having fallen to development, our beloved hills now feel the onslaught of the bulldozer, and building pads replace the irreplaceable grandeur of our ridges."</i> Bob Walker</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"The moment that someone is driving down the road and suddenly sees a bulldozer or some grading or a house under construction high in the hills where they never imagined development would take place is the moment they individually cross the line and say to themselves 'this has to be stopped.'"</i> Bob Walker (<i>Contra Costa Times</i> 8-27-1990)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"I've really felt evangelical about making people stop and realize that they're in the middle of a very stunning landscape. It's all around them, and so accessible, but often they've overlooked it because California is loaded with so many superlatives."</i> (December 1992, <i>Diablo</i> magazine.)</li>
