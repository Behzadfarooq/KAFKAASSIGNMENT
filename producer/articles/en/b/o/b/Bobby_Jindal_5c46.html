<p>In the 2003 <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_primary.html" title="Jungle primary">jungle primary</a> for <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Louisiana_7b55.html" title="Governor of Louisiana">governor of Louisiana</a>, Jindal came in first place with 33 percent of the vote. He received endorsements from the largest paper in Louisiana, the <i>New Orleans <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Picayune_a6ce.html" title="Times Picayune">Times Picayune</a></i>, the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Nagin_a73c.html" title="Ray Nagin">C. Ray Nagin</a>, and the outgoing Republican governor, Mike Foster. In the second balloting, Jindal faced the outgoing Lieutenant Governor <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Babineaux_Blanco_2515.html" title="Kathleen Babineaux Blanco">Kathleen Babineaux Blanco</a> of <a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafayette%2C_Louisiana_00c0.html" title="Lafayette, Louisiana">Lafayette</a>, a Democrat. Despite winning in Blanco's Lafayette, he lost many normally conservative parishes in north Louisiana, and Blanco prevailed with 52 per cent of the popular vote.</p>
<p>Political analysts have offered myriad explanations for his loss. Some have blamed Jindal for his refusal to answer questions about his record brought up in several advertisements, which the Jindal Campaign called "negative attack ads". Others note that a significant number of conservative Louisianans remain more comfortable voting for a Democrat than for a Republican. {fact}} Still others have mentioned the race factor, arguing that many voters are uneasy voting for a person of color.</p>
<p>Despite losing the election, the run for governor made Jindal a well known figure on the state's political scene. He formally declared his intention to run again on January 22, 2007, and is considered a leading Republican candidate for the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_gubernatorial_election%2C_2007.html" title="Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2007">Louisiana gubernatorial election of 2007</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the gubernatorial runoff, Jindal decided to run for Louisiana's 1st Congressional District. The incumbent, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Vitter_f4be.html" title="David Vitter">David Vitter</a>, was running for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> seat being vacated by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Breaux_0c48.html" title="John Breaux">John Breaux</a>. He moved to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenner%2C_Louisiana_ca36.html" title="Kenner, Louisiana">Kenner</a> to run for the congressional seat. He was endorsed by the Louisiana Republican Party in the primary despite the fact that Mike Rogers, also a Republican, was running for the same seat. The 1st District has been in Republican hands since a <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_election.html" title="Special election">special election</a> and is widely considered to be the most Republican district in Louisiana. Although Democrats have a plurality in registration, the 1st tends to vote for socially conservative candidates. Jindal also had an advantage because his campaign was able to raise over a million dollars very early in the campaign, making it harder for other candidates to effectively raise funds to oppose him. He won with 78 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>He was elected Freshman Class President and appointed to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_6c37.html" title="United States House Committee on Homeland Security">House Committee on Homeland Security</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Resources_5755.html" title="United States House Committee on Resources">House Committee on Resources</a>, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce_2268.html" title="United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce">House Committee on Education and the Workforce</a>.

<p>Congressman Jindal has stated that he is "100% against <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, no exceptions"<a href="http://www.siecus.org/policy/Pupdates/arch03/arch030075.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.siecus.org/policy/Pupdates/arch03/arch030075.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>When the plan was submitted to the voters, Jindal voted for the "Stelly Tax plan", an idea, named for former state Representative Vic Stelly of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Charles%2C_Louisiana_8679.html" title="Lake Charles, Louisiana">Lake Charles</a>, which was supposed to reduce the tax burden on a majority of Louisiana taxpayers. Whether or not the "Stelly Plan" is giving the desired results is still hotly debated statewide. Early Republican challenger <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Scalise_8503.html" title="Steve Scalise">Steve Scalise</a> challenged Jindal on his vote for this tax plan before Scalise dropped out of the congressional race in 2004.</p>
