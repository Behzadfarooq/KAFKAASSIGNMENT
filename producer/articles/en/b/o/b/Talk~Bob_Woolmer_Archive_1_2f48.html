<p>However, it would be useful to acknowledge the success Pakistan have had recently in a factual way. For example, a comparison of Pakistan's results under Woolmer and in the immediately preceding years would be useful, if anyone can make one.

<p>It was I who first included his death on wikipedia. I was reading his article after hearing on Sky Sports he'd been found unconscious... as soon as Sky broke the news I clicked edit and changed the first line to include DOB and DOD. I'm not a wikipedian but I experienced first hand there how quickly people flock to it whenever there is a major development. 22nd March 2007 19:34 UTC</p>
<p>This is my first time here - so be gentle with me.</p>
<p>The article pertaining to Bob Woolmer's death has a line in it about what the teams and the ICC are doing for the matches in the World Cup to mark his passing. It has a reference to what the Pakistan cricket team have or will do in the Zimbabwe match. When you consider that at best the Pak/Zim match is 2 days away, depending on time differences, how can this information be foretold!</p>
<p>Please change it - it reads like it has been done, and yet the game hasn't even been played.</p>

<p>Well... the Jamaican police has declared that the death of Bob is suspecious. There is no restriction on Pakistan team to fly out of West-Indies. But everyone is under suspition. Looks like he was murdered by "someone".</p>

<p>This page has been protected with no explanation given in the discussion page. That's bad WP etiquette at best, and breach of protocol at worst. I'm not surprised it's been done - pages of recently deceased persons are often locked for a period while the initial 'frenzy' passes - but editors should leave a note/comment in the discussion page re: protection, rather than appear to arbitrarily swoop in and lock pages. - 82.153.142.82 22:57, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is tastlessness really a determining factor in whether a fact is encyclopedic? The presence or absence of blood and vomit at eh scene of a so-far unexplained death can be newsworthy. They at least point to a medical issue (as opposed to, say, a violent assault).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. IMO. The relevant facts are that he died, that he was ill and we still don't know what he died of but that once its reliably reported we will include it. I just think we should avoid sensationalising the death until/unless more detail is released. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i></sup> 20:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Jamaican police are treating the death as suspicious after the autopsy but the reported statement on the BBC doesn't mentio murder ot marks on the neck. The BBC news report swimply said that they are awaiting toxicology reports before announcing the cause. I'm inclined to keep the article at this until there is a formal announcement of the cause of death. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i></sup> 06:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>should be in the article - a reputable source (namely The TImes of India) has reported speculation by a ex-Pakistan cricketer that Woolmer was murdered, so that speculation is notable and is anything but "idle".

<dd>"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. "<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> Reliable source? Yes. Signficant point of view? Yes. There are A LOT of newspapers and people that have published and discussed the theory that he was murdered for reasons connected to betting. And an ex-player said it. You are right that it is a speculation and a conspiracy theory, but the fact that it's a well-reported one being covered in a number of reputable newspapers means that it's highly enyclopedic to include it in the article. So it has to go in the article.

<dd>Thanks for the lesson in policy. If its speculation its a) not encyclopedic and b) not a fact. There is no consensus to include this information. Its information about Sarfaraz Nawaz not Bob Woolmer. Go and include it on Nawaz's article if you like but it has no home here until there are some confirmed facts to back it up. I'm reverting.

<dd>You're most welcome for the lesson. However, I'm not sure you've understood it. Wikipedia does not deal only in facts. The whole concept of neutral point of views is to discuss POINTS OF VIEW. I.e. OPINIONS. This is a significant opinion. It needs to be represented. Obviously opinions cannot be proven, by their nature - but if they are significant, they need to be reported.</dd>

<dd>The opinion has nothing to do with Sarfaraz Nawaz's article, it is about Bob Woolmer - Mr. Nawaz views are on-the-record, widely reported, and moreover this is a very good representation of a point of view that is being very widely discussed. The Nawaz suggestion should be reported here, as the 'murdered for match-fixing' is a widely held view, and AFAIK, there's nobody else that we can attribute this to. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 21:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Nssdfdsfds (silly name, though). Upsetting though such speculation may be, it is being widely reported. I saw it as a UK newspaper headline this evening. A simple <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?q=woolmer+murder" class="external text" title="http://news.google.co.uk/news?q=woolmer+murder" rel="nofollow">Google News search</a> confirms the widespread reporting. Having said that, we should keep the wilder speculations out of the article,and concentrate on what the official statements say. How about removing the Nawaz comment, and,<b>after</b> the police "treating it as suspicious" statement, saying that there is speculation that Woolmer might have been murdered,and giving one or two links,and leaving it at that? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we <i>have</i> to include it, I'm with Carcharoth that we keep it short and simple. Its totally distorting to report to the wildest speculation because its so far one bloke shooting his mouth off and not being picked up by other comments elsewhere. Someone said earlier that newsworthy did not equal encyclopedic and this is the perfect example of that. How about, after the police treating it as suspicious, we simply say that <i>following this statement there was widespread speculation as to the cause of death</i> and then follow to a couple of reasonable non-sensationalist links? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i></sup> 21:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is it distorting? There are hundreds of stories along the lines of "Was Woolmer murdered". We make clear that there have been a number of sensational claims, and we give one widely reported example, and follow up by saying that his wife disagrees with the claims. Saying 'widespread speculation as to the cause of death' is an absurd bowdlerisation of what's actually being said - if the speculation is murder by illegal gamblers, then report that. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 22:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That means that even when a speculative statement is referenced, if the reference is itself speculation (and not based upon fact) then it is not for Wikipedia. Look at <a href="../../../5/_/_/WP%7E5_d6bd.html" title="WP:5">WP:5</a> for what Wikipedia is. Why the rush to put it in?

<dd><a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> is not applicable. That policy refers to speculation about what might happen in the future - e.g., an article about a 2008 UK General Election (it might not happen in 2008, it might happen in 2009, 2010, or indeed 2007). This is nothing to do with what might happen in the future. This is a notable OPINION about what has ALREADY HAPPENED. You are arguing that because it has not been proven that Narwaz's claims are true, they should not be reported. This is incorrect. The fact is that the investigation could prove that he died of natural causes, but if reporting continues in the current vein, not withstanding the conclusion, it would still be notable that many sources report a belief he had been murdered. If <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> were applicable, there would be no such article as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">holocaust denial</a> (because it's a speculation about a event that happened in the past (the death of Bob Woolmer is an also an event in the past), and is crystal ball gazing in the sense that it hasn't yet been proven that the holocaust didn't happen (indeed, contrary to the current case, there is ample evidence that the holocaust *did* happen, in a sense the in inquest has been held, and the findings come out against the conspiracy theory angle, but still it gets an article here, because it's a notable viewpoint)) or <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speculation_about_the_papal_conclave%2C_2005.html" title="Speculation about the papal conclave, 2005">Speculation about the papal conclave, 2005</a>.

<dd>The denial is useful. I had it in before Spartaz reverted (albeit a shorter version). It seems wholly appropriate to discuss the widely-reported conspiracy theories along with her denial of them. The fact that newspapers are reporting and questioning her on the match-fixing murder theories suggests to me that it's a highly notable point of view that should be included in the article. I don't understand the opposition to this. Whitewashing the story by not mentioning the MASSIVE buzz about betting (for which Nawaz's comments are the only good source) is absurd and doesn't accurately reflect reality. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 21:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The 'offensive tittle-tattle' is in every newspaper in the country. Mrs. Woolmer has been explicitly asked about and has responded to the reports - she chose to comment at some length, and that's something the article documented before you deleted it.

<dd>I mean, if you're going to say 'x says' (in this case 'the police say'), it's rather critical that that's what x actually did say. In this case, they have not. However, Mr. Narwaz's claims are clearly attributable to him. Deciding what is 'true' is original research, and isn't appropriate. Reporting what reliable sources have said *is* appropriate. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 20:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I preferred the article with a separate section for speculation reports. I also think that this is a little controversial and rather than constantly have to revert the article, I'd like to see the talk page used to get consensus for new information. Up to now, its worked well. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i></sup> 14:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's downplay the speculation rather than highlighting it. Let's await the proper police report. Let's also treat the matter with more dignity. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyBriggs_eadb.html" title="User:PaddyBriggs">PaddyBriggs</a> 15:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His wife has appeared on several interviews discussing the speculation of murder. She doesn't have to do that, but the fact she has, suggests to me that it's quite appropriate, and not at all insensitive, to mention the specific allegations made by Narwaz. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 16:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
