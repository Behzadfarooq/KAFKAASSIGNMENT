<p>This article does not seem very concise, so I posted a cleanup template to it. It also seems to be a bit biased in a few parts, so if someone could examine that, that would be good. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenfergy_46ff.html" title="User:Benfergy">Benfergy</a> 23:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>This article is a bio, not an article. As bio's go, it's a puff-piece, and I would be be very surprised if the subject wasn't also the author. Coyly complimentary, it reads like advertising copy for a guns'n'ammo magazine.The following quotes will give you an idea of the problem:</p>
<p><br />
"“He traces his family roots to England, Ireland and the Micmac tribe of New Brunswick and northern Maine.”</p>
<p><br />
"An accomplished angler, Newman has caught more than 180 species of gamefish on fly fishing and light tackle, causing some to speculate he has caught more gamefish species than any other human, living or dead."</p>
<p><br />
“Newman’s Marine Corps nickname was Inhuman Newman, a moniker he attributes to "certain unseemly acts perpetrated here and there in my early days in the Corps." “</p>
<p><br />
“rising to the rank of Gunnery Sergeant (E-7) after being deep-selected for promotion to that prestigious rank in 1989.”</p>
<p><br />
“Newman was one of only two applicants among 12 in his testing group to win reassignment to Alpha Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, where he would serve as an assistant team leader, team leader and company training NCO. (The other 10 quit the testing process or were hospitalized and unable to return to duty.)”</p>
<p><br />
“In 1984, a superior officer refused to support Newman in a critical Marine Corps mission. Newman, knowing he must accomplish the mission anyway, acquired the direct support of a Marine brigadier general to accomplish the mission.”</p>
<p><br />
“Newman’s company commander in Kuwait attempted to wrongfully court-martial one of Newman’s NCOs for a very minor offense involving a young first lieutenant. Newman prevented the court martial and caused his company commander to be embarrassed before the battalion commander”</p>
<p><br />
“Newman values integrity and courage above all other leadership traits.”</p>
<p><br />
“(was) part of the 2nd Marine Division’s celebrated attack under Major General William "Bulldog" Keys USMC. "Leading Marines in ground combat was the greatest honor I could ever have hoped for. I miss my men and think of them daily," Newman says.”</p>
<p><br />
“Newman is well known for his uncanny ability to precisely predict the nature and location (by country) of terrorist attacks months, even years in advance, as well as anti-terrorist operations carried out by the U.S. Department of Defense and/or Central Intelligence Agency”</p>
<p><br />
There's more. It's well worth the read:)</p>
<p><br />
Newman the indestructible, part American-Indian, part legend, forever scarred by the knowledge of...(whistles theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly)...death...the horror, the horror... a knowledge he passed on to gooks, slopes and ragheads by the thousands, while saving the honour of his inncocent men, men he must lead, lead, LEAD INTO BATTLE, and men, (boys, really) who came to love him in that special way that only exists on the battle-field, only exists when one battle-weary soldier catches the eye of another in those moments at the shower tent when a man is just a man, for a second - no longer a merciless, remorseless, ENGINE OF DOOOOOOOM aimed at the enemies of liberty - and his towel slips a little and the sheer vulnerable, whiteness of his buttocks as they peek out softly above the harshness and roughness and manliness of the army-issue towel causes both to gasp involuntarily...and men become....closer...only to rush into battle the next day tortured by memories, desperate to forget, forget FORGET, all the while one can never forget the men who ...served...under you</p>
<p><br />
Pity he was never scarred by knowledge of self-reflection, or the knowledge of irony, or the knowledge of facts. I assume his secret Native American sixth-sense accounts for 'his uncanny ability to precisely predict the nature and location (by country) of terrorist attacks months, even years in advance'.</p>
<p><br />
There are no sources, and every single apparently 'factual' item on the page is fawningly praiseworthy. Quite an achievement really. Undoubtedly authored by the subject.</p>

<p>This article needs major work. I hardly know where to start. Is an author's own work considered verification? I doubt if one could reasonably verify any of this stuff anywhere but in his own writings.

<p>It might be worth mentioning, (for whichever benighted soul undertakes to make this page less full of it), that the radio show that is the subject's current claim to fame is regarded as 'hate-radio' by a segment of the population. References here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/print/nimmo020620051/" class="external free" title="http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/print/nimmo020620051/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/print/nimmo020620051/</a> <a href="http://www.bouphonia.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bouphonia.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bouphonia.blogspot.com/</a> (see 12/08)</p>
<p><br />
Among the reasons for this are his own statements, of which the following are representative.</p>
<p><br />
"Cindy Sheehan does not believe those filthy ragheads and camel jockeys in Iraq deserve freedom." (he's claiming that these are *her* thoughts, including the epithets.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2005/newman080805.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2005/newman080805.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2005/newman080805.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
"Kerry is also the first choice of such organizations as al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, who want George Bush out of the White House and John Kerry in. Infamous mass murderers like Kim Jung Il of North Korea, Bashar Assad of Syria, Yasser Arafat of the PLO, and the wanton thugs who form Iran’s terrorist government, all want Kerry to be the next American president. The Kerry camp is keeping all this very quiet, of course...Now you know why tyrants and terrorists everywhere want John Kerry in the White House"</p>

<p><br />
"Death to those who oppose us and may our enemies’ souls suffer in the bowels of hell for eternity."</p>
<p>(this quote is not ironic in its original context, by the way - it's a rhetorical flourish, but one he really means. I include it here to demonstrate the mind-set. Also, 'cause it sounds like al-Qaeda)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman111504.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman111504.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman111504.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
Lastly, I present for your edification...</p>
<p>"Sometimes nightmares of the Beirut bodies haunt me, but the (Basra) bodies never invade my sleep, I suppose because the latter were scum-sucking bottom feeders who got what was coming to them."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman090504.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman090504.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2004/newman090504.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
The people he's talking about were killed on the Basra Road, during the first Gulf War. They were fleeing Kuwait city. They had surrendered. The war was over. They had given in. The convoy included massive numbers of civilians, fleeing the city. It included relief and aid workers, doctors and friendly parties.</p>
<p>"At 5:35 p.m. (Eastern standard Time) Baghdad radio announced that Iraq's Foreign Minister had accepted the Soviet cease-fire proposal and had issued the order for all Iraqi troops to withdraw to positions held before August 2, 1990 in compliance with UN Resolution 660."</p>
<p><a href="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-death.htm" class="external free" title="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-death.htm" rel="nofollow">http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-death.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
Then, over the 60 miles of road, jam-packed with fleeing people, and over the course of days, US air and ground forces casually (and sometimes gleefully - officers referring to the action as 'a turkey-shoot' are representative, as are accounts of soldiers loading any ammo that they could find, to see what it did when it hit a car) massacred every, single living being on the road. In the immediate aftermath, the entire area was barred to outsiders, and the victims of the murder buried in trenches along the road. The story only really broke, if I remember right, when footage of the cleanup (using bulldozers to push the dead into ditches)was screened accientally as background footage to a news broadcast.</p>
<p>Unlike Gunny Bob, the not-too-bright individual flown in to cover it up, the Marines actually involved saw it differently. PBS covers this in its Voices From The War programme.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/voices/3.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/voices/3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/voices/3.html</a></p>
<p><br />
Nor was the massacre accidental. It was clearly planned, and clearly exectuted, with quite specific intentions. Air attacks bombed both ends of the road, making it impossible to escape, to allow for a more leisurely execution of the people now trapped there.</p>
<p>One of the pilots (Joe Seidl) seeing this trapped convoy said "It's almost like, um, hitting the jackpot. I mean there are vehicles all over the place. It is a very lucrative target. I mean, we can actually go out here and just kind of almost, I don't want to sound sarcastic or whatever, but we could actually out and really do some damage. Because I mean, there are thousands and thousands of vehicles out there and they're all heading north, and you know, they're probably all bad guys." (ref: PBS)</p>
<p><br />
Selected notes from people interviewed, and from live radio at the time, collected on PBS include:</p>
<p>"We had quite an audience and we were actually debriefing it in the intelligence tent. Lieutenant ... behind me had made a comment, "God, that's murder". And he said that loud enough to well, he was standing right behind me."</p>
<p>"Even in Vietnam I didn't see anything like this. It's pathetic," said Major Bob Nugent, an Army intelligence officer. (all ref PBS)</p>
<p><br />

The murder on the Basra Road was also condemned in the UK parliament.</p>

"It was like going down an American highway—people were all mixed up in cars in trucks. People got out of their cars and ran away. We shot them.... The Iraqis were getting massacred.” Pfc. Charles Sheehan-Miles, describing March 2, 1991, assault on retreating Iraqi column at Rumaila, Iraq, two days after cease-fire in Gulf War.</p>

Of course, Newman claims he is not a hate-speech distributor. It is his detractors who propagate hate-speech, he says. He has labelled 'liberals', whatever he may mean by that, as 'filled with hate and violence', an unusual epithet coming from a man whose entire life is a hymn to violence of all kinds, against everything that breathes, from fish to antelope to people, and who has (as demonstrated by his own proudly displayed CV) found no meaningful way of interacting with living things other than through brutality...and who has recommended that people who disagree with the American state's foreign policies by hanged.</p>

<p><br />
He's regularly been accused of distortion and challenged on his claims. One such example: <a href="http://soapblox.net/colorado/showDiary.do?diaryId=631" class="external free" title="http://soapblox.net/colorado/showDiary.do?diaryId=631" rel="nofollow">http://soapblox.net/colorado/showDiary.do?diaryId=631</a></p>
<p><br />
There are plenty of others. Google to find them. You'll have to wade through his endless series of rants characterising the people he wants dead as 'hate-filled'. His proof is that when he suggests they be killed, or rejoices (in his appalling, Louis L'amour-like prose) at the multifold deaths wreaked on others, they become...hate-filled towards him. Oh, the subtlety of his trained, skilled mind.</p>
<p>If the subject wishes an entry in an encyclopedia, then that entry should include reference to the entire picture he presents.</p>

<p>What gives with this article? I can see keeping it for the mere reason that he is noteworthy because he is a propagator of hate and an author of some minor works (they actually are on amazon.com). But do we really need to keep his whole freaking supposed Marine Corps resume? To anyone who's been in the service more than a few years, this is pretty standard stuff, with the usual end-of-tour award citation hyperbole. This should be reduced to "Newman is an ex-Marine who hosts a radio show, written a few books, has *** politics, and is controversial for *** reason." <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 00:22, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think I've made this article NPOV, but would appreciate a second opinion before removing the tag. I've left the military awards in as I don't know anything about the significance of such things. I've also left in his quote about calling for the execution of Kerry et al as, even though it's painting Mr Newman in a most distasteful light, they're his words, which I suspect he'd stand by, given the nature of other quotes attributable to him. Dancarney 21:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be ok to remove the tag now. If you haven't seen how this article originally appeared, it would be worth your time to go take a look at it before it was pared down. Compared to the original, it's about 20,000 times more neutral now.

<p>You clearly despise Mr. Newman. That's fine. But it's clouded your judgement in making a clearly NPOV article. For example, in your link, now you are claiming the article is an example of hyperbole, but not ad-hominem - but you're including "ad-hominem" (a logical fallacy) in the article. My edit is not whitewashing, it is clearing up a gross inaccuracy. If you can demonstrate a logical fallacy in Mr. Newman's article, you may edit without my interference. Your emotional bias, however, is clouding your own ability to use logic. Please articulate 1 solid example of hyperbole and ad hominem from the article. It's not that I care if you state on Mr. Newman's page that people disagree with him. But that should also be presented in a neutral fashion. An inaccurate statement scarcely qualifies as upholding the Wikipedia standard.</p>

<li>"<i>Murtha joins the likes of traitor Clayton Lonetree, the Marine security guard who gave top-secret intelligence to the Soviets, and traitor Robert Garwood, the Marine who went over to the enemy during the Vietnam War and was involved in holding and abusing US prisoners of war in North Vietnam while wearing the uniform of the enemy.</i>" - that too is hyperbole. How is John Murtha the same as them?</li>
<li>"<i>John "The Jellyfish" Murtha</i>" - that is ad hominem - attacking the person, not the idea</li>
<li>"<i>This vermin’s demand for retreat, surrender and negotiations with the enemy is so committed to assisting al Qaeda in their efforts in Iraq that he has posted his unspeakable demands on his website in the form of an official statement."</i> - this is ad hominem ("This vermin") and hyperbole ("...is so committed to assisting al Qaeda in their efforts in Iraq")</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want more examples, look at the posts above from other people. Feel free to locate more of his articles where he is moderate and post those links on the article. I won't delete them.

<p>Weak. For whatever reason, you've got an axe to grind with Mr. Newman-- why make Wikipedia suffer by lowering its standard, just for you to take your frustrations out on his Wikipedia page&#160;?</p>

<li>"<i>Furious Marines from wars as far back as World War II are spitting mad at the cowardly colonel and many want his head on a stake in the middle of the Marine Corps Commandant's lawn. Personally, I would not soil that good earth with so vile and despicable a piece of offal.</i>" - saying that many people are spitting mad is not an exaggeration, it's true. Whether or not they want his head on a stake is probably exaggeration, but so what? How is including a line in a Wikipedia article 'so and so uses hyperbole' even worth mentioning? To say "I'm hungry as a horse" is hyperbole, why bother mention that someone uses such a phrase? You had no problem removing his Marines resume, but want to include a completely useless line that he uses hyperbole???</li>
<li>"<i>Murtha joins the likes of traitor Clayton Lonetree, the Marine security guard who gave top-secret intelligence to the Soviets, and traitor Robert Garwood, the Marine who went over to the enemy during the Vietnam War and was involved in holding and abusing US prisoners of war in North Vietnam while wearing the uniform of the enemy.</i>" - Mr. Newman presented an argument of why he thought Murtha was a traitor. According to Mr. Newman's essay, being a traitor is what Murtha has in common with the others, therefore this is not hyperbole or exaggeration according to the definition. (<i>"Encouraging retreat is viewed as aiding the enemy by the Marines and is a violation of Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is punishable by death. Currently serving Marines, active duty or reserve, who encourage surrender are in violation of Article 100 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, an offense also punishable by death. Because Murtha is retired, he is virtually assured of not being prosecuted."</i>)</li>
<li>"<i>John "The Jellyfish" Murtha</i>" - that is not ad hominem. it IS an insult, but not ad hominem. "Ad hominem" as most people understand it refers to a logical fallacy where a person is attacked rather than their argument. <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html" rel="nofollow">Please visit this link for a brush up on what ad hominem is</a>. If Mr. Newman had said "John Murtha is a Jellyfish, so his anti Iraq war stance is invalid", that would have been an example of ad hominem. Invalidating the arguments of Murtha because of a personal attack is ad hominem. However, as I stated before, this is merely an insult, because the article argues what is wrong with Mr. Murtha's retreatist position (outside of the insult) and does not rely on the insult to negate Murtha's view.</li>
<li>"<i>This vermin’s demand for retreat, surrender and negotiations with the enemy is so committed to assisting al Qaeda in their efforts in Iraq that he has posted his unspeakable demands on his website in the form of an official statement."</i> - this is, again, an insult, not ad hominem (see above). As far as hyperbole goes ("...is so committed to assisting al Qaeda in their efforts in Iraq") the only words in there that are questionable are "so committed to". If you removed that phrase you are left with "... is assisting al Qaeda in their efforts in Iraq". This is actually true. Although it's not to say Murtha is directly helping al Qaeda by intent, it is fact that Murtha's position helps al Qaeda in Iraq. However, to say Murtha is committed to assisting al Qaeda is probably exaggeration... the kind of which that does not even bear mention in a Wikipedia article</li>

<li>Weak rebuttal to my rebuttal. Ok, change ad hominem to personal attacks or name calling. We can both live with that. Ad hominem is colloquially used by many people to mean personal attacks, but as you yourself said, he uses insults. So go ahead and change ad hominem. If you can't see in the plethora of articles that he has written that he stoops to exaggeration, insults, and falling back on his military service as a trump card, then I feel for you. I actually have read a good many of the articles he has written. As for having an axe to grind, I never heard of this dude until I stumbled across his advertisement (oops, I mean article). My axe has nothing to do with his politics. Look at my user page if you think I'm some feel-good liberal. Yes, I disagree with the war in Iraq, and I certainly disagree with a lot of what "Gunny Bob" says (or at least how he says it) but I didn't put 12 years in the army because I wanted to transform it into a hippie colony. It has to do with this article, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, which was a one-sided "rah, rah Gunny Bob" love-fest that made no mention of any of the controvery that surrounds him, nor any mention of questions about how he expresses his viewpoint, etc. He is controversial because of statements like calling senators and representatives traitors, etc. etc. (and no, I'm not going to list every controversy). If you haven't seen the original, please take a moment and look at it. THAT is lowering the standard. So is white-washing, which you seem to think represents neutrality (disagrees with Murtha - you could have at least said vehemently disagrees). Do what you want with the article. My main concern was original version. I have better things to do than worry about a chest-beating, braggart ex-Marine, who brings just as much shame to the Corps as he claims Murtha does by lowering the standard of political debate in the U.S. But in these times, both sides are guilty of that. --<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 11:14, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

That was the weakest response I've seen yet. If you found my rebuttal weak, it was probably just over your head- outside your realm of comprehension. I already had looked at your page and did not think you were a full blown hippy or something, but you are openly anti-Iraq war. Mr Newman is not. Maybe you took Mr. Newman's comments against Murtha personally, and that was your axe to grind. Using a metaphor in calling Murtha a "jellyfish" (a jellyfish has no spine) maybe you felt he was calling you a coward too, if you agree with Murtha?</p>
<p>Anyway, your bitching and moaning about my "whitewashing" - when I removed a statement that was partially unsupportable, and partially complete useless filler is just plain sad. You've decimated this article, removing awards, biographical info, things that would lend him credibility (which he has). Then you throw a hissy fit because I remove the ad hominem line (which was incorrect) and the "He uses hyperbole against his opponents" line. He is a radio personality for God's sakes. Do you have any idea how common hyperbole is? and how removing a stupid line like that is not "whitewashing". If there's anyone here who's committed an egregious crime against Wikipedia, it's you and your censorship of Mr. Newman's biography.</p>
<p>For the record, I used to listen to him all the time when he was on 630AM KHOW. He was co-host with Scott Redmond. It was called the Redmond &amp; Newman show. Redmond was on the left and Newman was on the right (figuratively speaking). It was a great show and it was very sad when they cancelled it. Gunny Bob is not a hate-ist as you misleadingly portray him to be.</p>

LoL, has anyone ever told you that you're really funny when your feelings are hurt? No? They should have. So you accuse me of trolling for making inflammatory comments toward you, but you reply with an inflammatory comment? Brilliant.</p>
<p>My purpose on this page is simple.</p>
<p>(1) I'm taking a stand against the <i>hypocrisy</i> of someone who would whittle Gunny Bob's Wikipedia entry down to a mere fraction of what it once was, deleting facts and biographical info, only to insist on adding a line that boils down to "Mr. Newman uses the English language against his opponents". You've treated this article like there was only a limited amount of space and the words chosen had to be careful and sparse. Of course, the idea behind Wikipedia is that this online encyclopedia is NOT limited by a finite amount of paper. (2) I like Gunny Bob, and it's sad to see a leftist elitist decimate this page simply for disagreeing with Gunny's views.</p>

<li>Hehe, this is fun. Incidentally, the time stamp is U.S. time (probably EST), and I am in Japan, ergo I'm not up at 3 a.m. doing this, rather it is daytime, and my job has plenty of free time at a computer terminal. If you knew anything about the military (I'm pretty certain you have never served) you would know that the original was a listing of every mundane job and award the esteemed Gunnery Sergeant had. Note that awards are still listed (the more important ones - oops, is that subjective?) and so are some duty assignments (the more important ones - subjectivity again). If anything, you should probably re-insert the recon stuff - that is important. As far as a leftist elite, I'm not certain what you mean. I consider all rabid partisans idiots, and I, like Gunny Bob, don't consider myself a Republican or a Democrat. Like P.J. O'Rourke said, Democrats promise you government can do everything for you and knows best for you, and Republicans say government is incompetent, then get elected and prove it. For the record, Murtha's wanting to cut and run isn't a viable option. I never have thought that was the way to go. My feelings are not hurt; rather I thank you for a) correctly pointing out the usage of ad hominem (I concede you are correct) b) making my time on here a bit more fun.

<p>I would like to chime in here and say that Nobunga24 is clearly in the right. The piece in this Newman guy was extremely biased at first, portraying him as some God-like figure (I was the first person to flag the post initally, but more on reasons of format). The article as it stands is much better, showing the whole context of his show.</p>
<p>More importantly though, it's clear that this pro-Newman poster(who posts anonymously, who woulda thunk it?) seems to think Wikipedia is a shrine of worship to Bob Newman, when in point of fact it isn't. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenfergy_46ff.html" title="User:Benfergy">Benfergy</a> 03:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Benfergy, you exemplify the brilliance with which I've been dealing with. For example, you make a blatant jab about my anonymity ("who woulda thunk it"), and yet I show up to your user page and find "WHO WOULDA THUNK IT" -- an ANONYMOUS USER!! There is no picture of yourself, no address, no resume, just this: "I am a native of Minnesota, and now live in Wisconsin".</p>
<p>So let's make this even- I am a native of California and currently live in California.</p>
<p>Oh Wait! My IP address is showing! You've got a username covering your IP! Now I am, in fact, LESS anonymous than you are&#160;!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Get the point yet?</p>
<p>Look, I wasn't here when you guys <b>started</b> whittling the page down to nothing as if you guys are experts on Bob Newman. I only showed up when you <b>finished</b>, and both of you have been hypocrites through this whole thing. Although, I will admit that Nobunaga conceded some points and I can at least say he can be reasoned with. On the other hand, "Benfergy", my fellow anonymous user, it's people like you with an inability to think past their nose that I have an issue with.</p>
<p>You ought to listen to Mr. Newman's show before you come in here all cavalier and think that deleting tons of facts until you're down to barely a few paragraphs makes for good Wikipedia editing.

<ul>
<li>Without a DD214, the military service claims are unverifiable too. The assignment listing is every mundane, unexceptional job he ever had. The awards go down to his marksmanship medal, which every single Marine has.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Newman’s career was not without controversy. In 1984, a superior officer refused to support Newman in a critical Marine Corps mission. Newman, knowing he must accomplish the mission anyway, acquired the direct support of a Marine brigadier general to accomplish the mission. Upon learning of Newman’s circumvention of the chain of command, that superior officer attempted to terminate Newman’s career, an endeavor which failed when high-ranking officers at Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps in Washington, DC, supported Newman over the aforementioned officer.</i> - unverifiable, no mention of what the critical mission was, and actually a very silly thing to include, especially as an example of "controversy" in his career.</li>
<li><i>In 1991, Newman’s company commander in Kuwait attempted to wrongfully court-martial one of Newman’s NCOs for a very minor offense involving a young first lieutenant. Newman prevented the court martial and caused his company commander to be embarrassed before the battalion commander, thus drawing the considerable ire of his company commander. Newman’s career survived this as well.</i> - ditto.</li>

<dd>Yes, it's not a paper ditionary. But that doesn't mean everything has to go in here. Length doesn't matter, but the importance of what goes in does. Most of this is fluff, this has become an obvious tribute/shrine to Newman.

Basically, unless <i>reliable secondary sources</i> (not DD214s-- that's a <i>primary</i> source) exists to support these claims, they do not belong in an encyclopedia.

<li>Thank you for addressing the issue of "absolute length", at least the discussion is starting become more honest. Not that Mr. Newman is as important as the president or anything, but the article for George W. Bush is over 4.5 times as long, just to point out that a biographical article could stand to be longer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you really want to be honest, you'd admit why you want to cut this article down so small. It's simple. The article is full of NPOV facts that make Mr. Newman look like he has credibility. You'd like to censor that credibility because you don't like his point of view.... Yeah, he thinks Kerry, Murtha and Kennedy are traitors but he doesn't just SAY it, he gives evidence and reasons for his opinions.</p>
<p>I used to listen to him almost everyday when he had the Redmond and Newman radio show (630KHOW). This was also in Denver, during the afternoon drive time. Redmond was left wing, Newman was right wing, and neither one of them was extreme or "Far-right" or "Far-left". I thought they had a good chemistry despite some occassional heated arguments. It was a disappointment when they were canceled.</p>

<li>While is it always good to cite facts in articles, many articles here at Wikipedia simply are not cited. While I am not encouraging that with this article, perhaps it would be easier to find sources that discredit the information present on the article. --<font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../z/s/i/User%7EZsinj_4f9a.html" title="User:Zsinj">Zsinj</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../z/s/i/User_talk%7EZsinj_6340.html" title="User talk:Zsinj">Talk</a></sup></font> 07:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There is more to citing facts than simply establishing truth. Encyclopedias are written from <i>secondary sources</i> in order to establish the <i>importance</i> of the facts cited. I could write a factual NPOV article about myself, but it would be original research based on primary sources, because the facts of my life are not important enough to have appeared in secondary sources. Bob Newman is certainly a more notable figure than I am, but I sincerely doubt that much of the fluff that appears in this adulatory article can be found in anyone's writing but his own.</li>
<li>As for my own POV, yes, it is certainly different from Mr. Newman's. But my concern here is that the article is not encyclopedic-- I would be equally ready to shorten an article as over-the-top as this one were its subject <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Murtha_76bd.html" title="John Murtha">John Murtha</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>.

It's an <i>encyclopedia</i>, pure and simple. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 19:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Mwanner, your responses are.... shall we say.... deceptive, yet transparent? flat out amusing? <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a>'s userpage indicates a discernable political bias. He has a banner stating he is a "member or supporter of moveon.org". Nothing else needs to be said about that despicable organization. Your page has been carefully kept free of political bias, but your actions have proved otherwise. You almost seemed surprised that I knew you were of a different POV than MR. Newman before you admitted as such. LOL. Your claims of "I would be equally ready to shorten an article as over-the-top as this one were its subject John Murtha or John Kerry." Yet BOTH of the articles you named (Murtha &amp; Kerry) are LONGER than Newman's article. I looked through the history of these two pages to see if you were a man of your word. I was not surprised to see you made no attempts to make those two articles more "concise". For the record, I <b>don't</b> believe Murtha or Kerry's pages need to be shortened either. But this shouldn't surprise you that I am more consistent than you are. More intellectually honest.</p>
<p>Do I also need to remind you of your claim that everything needs to be verifiable? The only thing I couldn't verify was a line that NOBUNAGA added- "however critics charge he is actually a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemicist.html" title="Polemicist">polemicist</a>" Nobody had ever made this charge of "far-right polemicist" except for Nobunaga.</p>
<p>As I stated before, it was clear that your attempt to remove material from Mr. Newman's page had more to do with your own political bias than quality of material. The interest of yourself, Benfergy, &amp; Nobunaga expressed was more in removing verifiable facts that lent Mr. Newman credibility than quality of source info (i.e. the fake far right polemicist charge which none of you attempted to remove). And I'm not referring to the article as it originally stood... your most recent "(rv to last reasonable length version. See talk)" attempt had to be intervened by someone with more sound logic than yourself. Thanks for playing. It was fun while it lasted. --<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairNBalanced_c59c.html" title="User:FairNBalanced">FairNBalanced</a> 06:35, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your edits show a discernable bias. Gee, I wonder if FairNBalanced loves Gunny Bob. I wonder if FairNBalanced thinks anyone who disagrees with his views is a leftist. I wonder if FairNBalanced has an overly high opinion of his intellect. Stop coming on here and lecturing everybody on what is wikipedia, what is not wikipedia, what lowers the standards of wikipedia, when your only edits have been to this page and Charlie Sheen, as "FairNBalanced" or as your previous edits as an anonymous IP. The article as it stands now is pure shit, but as you can see, you've been left to play with it all by yourself, and yet you continue to scream and cry and throw a tantrum. Please, show us the documentation that proves everything that is in this article now. And not from Gunny Bob's site, nor from his columns. Oh, and before you lecture me about personal attacks, please reread your previous edits to the talk page. But then again, if you can't see how over the top his comments are, or what is wrong with this article, I'm sure you will see nothing wrong with your comments either. I'm removing this page from my watchlist, and you can sit here and protect your precious article from moonbats and pinkos all by your little self. Hey, while you're at it, maybe you should hop over to the Ann Coulter article - there are some unflattering things written about about her. Don't pretend to know what my politics are, because you don't. My support for MoveOn.org is purely moral support - I support any organization that will help elect somebody other than the President we now have. It's the man and his administration, not the party, I object to. But hey, guess what, I was involved in the execution of their foreign policy decisions, so my viewpoint might, just might, be a little different than yours - it's been tempered by reality. You don't even have the moral courage to come out and say that you are an avid supporter of Bob Newman - you pretend that you are on a quest for neutrality. Well, continue on that quest, little trooper. Don't forget your newspaper hat and wooden sword. --<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 08:10, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>FYI to all - when I created this article for Gunny Bob Newman last year I used the entry for Colin Powell as a model. Thanks to "FairNBalanced" for restoring this to it's original form.</p>

<p>The list of books looks like it was lifted directly from <a href="http://850koa.com/pages/shows_gunny-books.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://850koa.com/pages/shows_gunny-books.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, except for the publisher/Amazon URLs at the end of each title. They are listed in the same order with the same grouping titles. I realize that this is just a list of books that could be found via a search, but does this count as plagiarism or copyright violation from the 850 KOA site? There was a similar issue with Wikipedia having articles listing various Top 500 lists of music from Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Also, do all of these book titles here belong in this article? The last eleven are mostly related to Outdoorsman activities which doesn't balance out with the majority of the article. Most of it is Military career. - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthPerson_1927.html" title="User:EarthPerson">EarthPerson</a> 21:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In response to your question, I can give you my opinion, but in Wikipedia decisions are usually taken by concensus, so I may be overruled! The list of books can't really be thought of as a copyvio - there is not really any way of writing the name of a book "in your own words" - you have to use the exact same text otherwise it's a different title. The fact that both sites list the same books is simply because these are the books that Bob N has written. If on the other hand a section of PROSE was directly copied from another site, then that would be copyvio and should be removed (or better, rewritten). With the EClerx article, the WHOLE article was copied from another copyright source and that's why I took the action to blank and flag as I did. Hope this helps. I'm also fairly new to Wikipedia; if you've listed this as noted in your comment above, then a more experienced user (probably an admin) will likely as not give their view. -- <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMightyWarrior_77f6.html" title="User:MightyWarrior">MightyWarrior</a> 18:38, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took out the fishing photo as it did not seem relevant to the article overall. I cropped the uniform photo to remove the dog as it was also not relevant. Personally, I do not like this photo as the lighting is harsh. His last official portrait, or a publicity or headshot from the radio station would be better. Also, I replaced the USMC flags with the USMC portal which leads to much more information. --<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthPerson_1927.html" title="User:EarthPerson">EarthPerson</a> 04:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
