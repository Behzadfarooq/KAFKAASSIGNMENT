<p>Bobby Caldwell was born in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to Bob and Carolyn Caldwell, the hosts of Suppertime, an early television variety show. Living in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> and, chiefly, <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a> (which he has called an influential "dumping ground" for all kinds of music), he took up <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> as a preteen. Forming his own <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_%28music%29.html" title="Band (music)">band</a> at 17, he took the group on the road, later recording an <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">album</a> entitled <i>Kathmandu</i>.</p>
<p>Caldwell's first performances were more rock-oriented than the bulk of his career would indicate; early dates had him playing <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_%28band%29.html" title="Cream (band)">Cream</a> covers in small clubs.</p>

<p>Ten years later, Bobby Caldwell recorded his <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_record.html" title="Gold record">double platinum</a>-attaining self-titled solo album, scoring hits with the singles "What You Won't Do for Love", "My Flame" and, in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, "Down for the Third Time". In order to ensure significant airplay on the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>-dominated <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> radio format of the time, Caldwell's management took certain steps—such as portraying the artist only in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silhouette.html" title="Silhouette">silhouette</a> on the cover and in advertisements—to hide the fact that he was <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_%28people%29.html" title="White (people)">white</a>. The secret was, for obvious reasons, shattered by his first live appearances.</p>
<p>After the tracks were first recorded and the record was considered "complete," the head of the label said that he enjoyed the album but couldn't hear a <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_parade.html" title="Hit parade">hit</a>. Attempting to address this issue, Caldwell and his band re-entered the studio, laying down the song's now-familiar rhythm tracks. After he quickly penned a set of lyrics, "What You Won't Do for Love" was born.</p>
<div class="thumb tleft">

<div class="thumbcaption">"What You Won't Do for Love" in its novelty vinyl incarnation</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Reaching the top ten on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, the song proved to be a success, though a bit of a surprise one due both to the haste with which it was written and the fact that Caldwell assumed "My Flame", the LP's second track ("What You Won't Do for Love" is the sixth), would wind up as the standout single. The album which contained it was later re-released under the song's title. The single was also marketed in the form of a distinctive red <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>-shaped 45-RPM vinyl record (advertised as "the single that gets to the heart of the matter"), now a collector's item frequently seen on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>. Although the record is heart-shaped, the grooves on the vinyl, of course, are round, even though the sleeve would lead one to think otherwise. (The <i>What You Won't Do for Love</i> album also received a novelty release on yellow vinyl.)</p>
<p>While the original song still receives frequent airplay today, it has been covered, re-made (once, in 1998, by Caldwell himself) and sampled many times since 1978. <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_West_%28band%29_5573.html" title="Go West (band)">Go West</a>'s version rose high in the adult contemporary charts, and <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyz_II_Men_468d.html" title="Boyz II Men">Boyz II Men</a>'s version in 2004, <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>'s "Do for Love," which samples the lyric, also attained a good deal of popularity. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldie.html" title="Goldie">Goldie</a> covered it on his 1998 EP <i>Ring of Saturn</i> (the lyrics were sung by Diane Charlemagne). In addition, "My Flame" was covered by actress/singer <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanessa_Lynn_Williams_5d26.html" title="Vanessa Lynn Williams">Vanessa Williams</a> for her 1999 Greatest Hits cd and also sampled by Bad-Boy recording artist <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Notorious_B.I.G._15bd.html" title="The Notorious B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> and integrated into the song Sky's the Limit; which was also another major <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">Rap</a>/<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">Hip-Hop</a> hit.</p>

<p>Caldwell's sophomore period involved the considerable task of following up such a staggering success as <i>What You Won't Do for Love</i>; during this time, his Japanese audience steadily eclipsed his American one. <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_music.html" title="1980 in music">1980</a>) and <i>Carry On</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_in_music.html" title="1982 in music">1982</a>), were artistic improvements upon the first album, but did not match its <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commercial</a> success. They were, however, bestsellers in Japan -- <i>The Cat</i> went <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_album.html" title="Gold album">platinum</a> and <i>Carry On</i> gold -- and sealed Bobby's reputation as a superstar in that country.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_in_music.html" title="1983 in music">1983</a> saw Bobby Caldwell put out <i>August Moon</i>, a project bearing a much more rock- than soul-oriented sound, in Japan only; it was released in the United States in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>

<p>Though <i>August Moon</i> went gold, Caldwell subsequently took a <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hiatus.html" title="Hiatus">hiatus</a> from recording, instead directing his efforts toward composing songs for other performers, most notably "Heart of Mine" for <a href="../../../b/o/z/Boz_Scaggs_7d68.html" title="Boz Scaggs">Boz Scaggs</a>, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Next_Time_I_Fall_0f3f.html" title="The Next Time I Fall">The Next Time I Fall</a>" for <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Grant_018d.html" title="Amy Grant">Amy Grant</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cetera_6327.html" title="Peter Cetera">Peter Cetera</a>, "Janet" for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodores.html" title="Commodores">Commodores</a>, "Niagara Falls" for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28band%29.html" title="Chicago (band)">Chicago</a>, and "All or Nothing at All" for <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jarreau_993b.html" title="Al Jarreau">Al Jarreau</a>.</p>
<p>Caldwell sold albums at a steady pace throughout the 1990s, producing <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_music.html" title="1991 in music">1991's</a> <i>Stuck on You</i>, recorded with a sixty-piece orchestra, and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_music.html" title="1993 in music">1993's</a> <i>Where is Love</i>, the latter having been recorded with musicians who had previously played with Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett along with a twenty-four piece orchestra.</p>
<p>During this period, the airplay of his music shifted from the declining R&amp;B radio format to the then-nascent <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smooth_jazz.html" title="Smooth jazz">smooth jazz</a> stations. Caldwell is frequently cited as a staple of the genre, with "What You Won't Do for Love" as well as lesser-known singles such as "Real Thing", "All or Nothing at All" (both from <i>Heart of Mine</i>) still featuring prominently on programmers' playlists.</p>

<p><a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_music.html" title="1995 in music">1995</a> saw the release of <i>Soul Survivor</i>, marking a turn toward coverage of others' songs.

<p>He later turned to singing nothing but <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> standards and original, yet big band standard-like songs (such as the much-promoted "Tomorrow") on <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_music.html" title="1996 in music">1996's</a> <i>Blue Condition</i> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_music.html" title="1999 in music">1999's</a> <i>Come Rain or Come Shine</i>. <i>Blue Condition</i> was recorded in real-time, live with a sixty-piece string section and twenty-piece jazz band in the same Capitol Records studios used by such icons as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Bobby Darin.</p>

<p>In 2005, Caldwell released <i>Perfect Island Nights</i>, his first album of mostly original studio material since 1993. The record features a new version "Rain", a track which made its debut on his second anthology release, <i>Time and Again</i>, as well as versions of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Perry_a4b8.html" title="Phil Perry">Phil Perry</a>'s "Perfect Island Night", "Where is the Love" (rendered as a duet with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deniece_Williams_a5d4.html" title="Deniece Williams">Deniece Williams</a>) and "Our Day Will Come".

<p>Caldwell has contributed music to a number of movies. He has both written and performed original songs for 1986's <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_School_63c2.html" title="Back to School">Back to School</a></i> ("Educated Girl"), 1988's <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_and_me.html" title="Mac and me">Mac &amp; Me</a></i> ("Take Me, I'll Follow You"), 1988's <i>Salsa</i> ("Puerto Rico") and its sequel ("Every Teardrop").</p>
<p>Songs penned by Caldwell but performed by others have appeared in films such as 1989's <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters_2.html" title="Ghostbusters 2">Ghostbusters 2</a></i> ("The Promised Land", performed by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James__J.T.__Taylor_2238.html" title="James &quot;J.T.&quot; Taylor">James "J.T." Taylor</a>, the lead singer of <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kool_%26_the_Gang_24e1.html" title="Kool &amp; the Gang">Kool &amp; the Gang</a>) and 1987's <i>Princess from the Moon</i> ("Stay With Me", performed by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cetera_6327.html" title="Peter Cetera">Peter Cetera</a>).</p>
<p>Due to what Caldwell has cited in interviews a lower cost of use than the original recordings, his versions of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> standards have appeared in several films. Examples include 2002's <i>LakeBoat</i> and 2001's <i><a href="../../../s/i/m/Simone.html" title="Simone">Simone</a></i>.</p>
<p>Caldwell also composed and performed "Don't Quit", the theme song for Body by Jake's workout video of the same name. He also appears in the associated music video, musically urging an actor portraying a weak young man to engage in <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weight_training.html" title="Weight training">weight training</a> in order to defeat the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bully</a> of a local <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach.html" title="Beach">beach</a>.</p>
