<p>He wrote the songs "On the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wings_of_a_Dove_c327.html" title="Wings of a Dove">Wings of a Dove</a>" and "Carroll County Accident."

<p>The country song "Carroll County Accident," a hit for and now one of the signature songs of Porter Wagoner, was written when Ferguson passed through Carroll County when driving from Nashville to a concert for the Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia, Miss., according to an interview Ferguson granted with Steve Eng for the Wagoner biography "A Satisfied Mind." He recounted that he passed a sign for Carroll County in Tennessee, which inspired the song's title, and when he saw a sign for Carroll County in Mississippi, he considered it an omen that he should write it. Wagoner took the song to No. 2 on the Billboard country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the Cash Box country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton.</p>
