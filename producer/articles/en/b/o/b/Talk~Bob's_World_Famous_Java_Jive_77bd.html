	    <p>This is my first attempt at this, and as of yet it is still a work in progress. Please be patient with me as I learn the ropes, and feel free to offer any advice or necessary corrections. I have not fully explored the ins and outs of every facet needed to make worthy and varifiable contributions, but I am acquiring all the information to help varify everything within the article and learn what I need to to improve my efforts. I know I also need to work on format and things, and should be making some corrections within the next 24 hours. Until then, here are a few sources to start the verification process:</p>

<p>p.s. it is making sure that these links aren't spam, and I am hoping they are not.</p>
<p>Thanks.--Bonzzort 00:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am sorry, I am really confused.... I made a page and within minutes was sent a message saying it was scheduled for speedy deletion because it was blatant promotion of a business. It gave me information which I could use to try and state my case and explain article and it's relevence among other things. It stated quite clearly I could post a "Hang On" as well as post on this discussion page as to why it is a valid article.</p>
<p>In that defense I was not given a chance to make, I was posting an article on a historical land mark in the city where I live. I am niether affiliated with this establishment nor am I what you would call an avid customer of it in it's current incarnation. I have sources to verify that which I wrote, not all of which were available to me at the time of this posting. I didn't feel I was doing anything wrong or terribly prematurely, as all they while I was reading the rules and making sure I wasn't breaking them, I kept reading statements to the effct of "Jump right in and get started" and such, things that bolstered my confidence and let me think this was a good idea, and that I couldn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Here is the article I posted. I would like an explanation in detail as to where exactly I have been inappropriate. I am not trying to spam or make a big deal, and I have read most all the rules that apply to this, so you can understand my confusion. I am not mad, but incredibly bewildered, and would simply like some clarification.</p>

<p>I have been confused about the process of arbitration and the simple practice of communication between one person and another. Furthermore I am confused as to who else there is to talk to and how one might try to get ahold of someone to discuss things with or resolve possible issues. I am trying to get up to speed on everything but have now found it very hard to both defend myself and learn what I have missed and what else I need to know.</p>
<p>It all started when I posted an article on an old local building with unique architecture. I followed that by creating this discussion page and posting the rather clueless message, along with my sources for the article, as I thoght I was supposed to do. As soon as I finished posting that, I received the following:</p>
<p>A tag has been placed on Bob's World Famous Java Jive, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add “hangon” on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. Mhking 00:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went to put the “hangon” on my article but it was already gone. I then responded to Mhking, and received this in return:</p>
<p>The text appears to be sales-oriented material that may have been published in another medium. In order to have it retained once posted, I'd strongly suggest reviewing the Wikipedia guidelines regarding inclusion of material (Wikipedia:List of policies), and keeping in mind that the subjects of articles need to be notable, and have verifiable independent and empirical sources that can be referenced. Nothing you've presented on this particular restaurant has provided notability of the restaurant. --Mhking 01:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the article in question, my first attempt at anything serious on Wikipedia. I was under the impression it was to be verified by any and all who were to visit the page. I was under the impression my writing would be subject to scrutiny, and more than likely edited beyond recognition. I did not expect it to be deleted without fair inquisition.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Talk%7EBob%27s_World_Famous_Java_Jive_77bd.html" title="Edit section: Bobs World Famous Java Jive">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Bobs World Famous Java Jive</b></span></h3>
<p><i><b>Bob’s “World Famous” Java Jive</b></i> was built in 1927, and is located at 2102 S. Tacoma Way in <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma.html" title="Tacoma">Tacoma</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a>. Originally a drive-thru called the Coffee Pot Restaurant, <i><b>The Jive</b></i>, as its regulars refer to it, is a vintage coffee pot shaped building known as a “Duck” (a form of novelty architecture shaped like an oversized object to promote its business). Built with a wooden frame and stucco finish, it was designed by local artist and promoter Bert Smyser and constructed in sections by local veterinarian and owner Otis G. Button. It originally housed a restaurant on the ground floor and an apartment above. In 1955 it was bought by Bob and Lylabelle Radonich and has been a restaurant and lounge since then. It was Lylabelle who coined the moniker “Java Jive”, adopting it from a lyric in an old song of the same name by the <a href="../../../i/n/k/Ink_Spots_82d4.html" title="Ink Spots">Ink Spots</a>. Danette Staatz, the Radonich’s daughter, inherited the business from her father when he died in 2002.</p>
<p>It’s interior is adorned with years of accumulated campy nostalgia, photographs, strands of Christmas lights and a lot of bamboo branches, giving the place an abstract, jungle themed motif cherished by loyal patrons. Autographs of those who have frequented the establishment are written or often times carved on tables, walls, etc. Over the years it has hosted vaudeville shows and <a href="../../../u/s/o/USO_aad2.html" title="USO">USO</a> tours, various styles of music and karaoke, featured curbside dining and go-go girls, and even achieved official status as a local historical landmark from the City of Tacoma.</p>
<p>Adding to the mystique of this quaint little dive bar are the urban legends and pop culture icons that weave their way in and out of its doors. Tales tell of the place originally being intended as a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speakeasy.html" title="Speakeasy">speakeasy</a>, but that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a> ended before the building opened. Others say that the notorious <a href="../../../d/2E/b/D.B._Cooper_888d.html" title="D.B. Cooper">D.B. Cooper</a> made his last known appearance seated in one of the bus booths at the bar. It actually was home to two chimpanzes who lived in the Jungle Room, named Java and Jive. The chimps played drums for customers for several years until animal rights protests and Health Department complaints forced the owners to give the pets to friends. It has survived fires, threats of demolition, and financial turmoil. It exists today as a tavern and venue for local and touring bands alike. It was threatened with closure in the early portion of 2007 due to electric and fire code violations, but volunteers rallied to support the venue and make the necessary accomodations to keep this local institution up and running. Prior to this incident, it had only closed once before in 52 years. The tavern was shut down for one day in 1996 when the building lost power because of a small electrical fire.</p>
<p>The Java Jive has been featured in the films; <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Fugitives_1d5d.html" title="Three Fugitives">Three Fugitives</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_You_to_Death_d728.html" title="I Love You to Death">I Love You to Death</a>, <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_8bf5.html" title="10 Things I Hate About You">10 Things I Hate About You</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/y/Say_Anything_ddd5.html" title="Say Anything">Say Anything</a>. The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Channel_2ce1.html" title="History Channel">History Channel</a> series "Hit the Road" had an episode focusing on roadside architecture in which the Jive was featured prominently. Hollywood stars <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Bow_982c.html" title="Clara Bow">Clara Bow</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Lloyd_3639.html" title="Harold Lloyd">Harold Lloyd</a> and later <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> are said to have hung out at the Jive during its early days. Other celebrities of note to drop in over the years were the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventures.html" title="Ventures">Ventures</a>, who often performed there before the Tacoma surf-rock band scored its first big hit “Walk, – Don’t Run,” in 1960. Members of <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> hung out there in the ’80s, though the urban legend that the band performed there isn’t true. Members of Tacoma punk band <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Trouble_eb40.html" title="Girl Trouble">Girl Trouble</a> were also regulars around that time; singer Kurt Kendall and guitarist Bill “Kahuna” Henderson met there. Girl trouble has been a staple act at the Jive since their inception, carrying on the Garage Rock and Go-Go tradition the establishment has become renowned for. <a href="../../../n/e/k/Neko_Case_db16.html" title="Neko Case">Neko Case</a> was even employed as a bartender there before she became a rising alt-country star. <a href="../../../k/e/a/Keanu_Reeves_c4b9.html" title="Keanu Reeves">Keanu Reeves</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Phoenix_2f32.html" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a> signed and dated their monikers in one of the booths during the filming of I Love You to Death.</p>

<p><i>The following are statements made on my own and Mhkings discussion pages, as I don’t really have a clue what I am doing in regards to communicating with one another. I can see that I am getting nowhere as I haven’t gotten any response, but I would like someone to read through what I have wrote and give me some assistance please.</i></p>
<p>I haven't quite got a handle on the whole "Discussion page" form of communication yet obviously, and ask that you please forgive me for this and anything else I may inadvertantly be ignorant of. I have read the rules and wish to follow them, but just because I "know" all the rules, doesn't mean I will have "learned" them. Please be patient, and I will do my best to get up to speed if I am going to make any further contributions. I do not want to spam, be argumentative, or be a source of distress for anyone</p>
<p>As for my choice of my first contribution, "Bob's World Famous Java Jive", I picked something topical in my community, that I had some verifiable knowledge of, and that I had no severe personal attachments to. This building has been a part of the Tacoma community for 80 years and is a historical land mark. It is a novel design and style of architecture that is all but obsolete in our modern world. It has a rich and verifiable history. It is the structure itself that the article is on, and not the business that occupies it, though they are synonymous at this point in time. The business itself is as quirky as the bar, but I am in no way out to promote a bar, per sé. I don't advocate over indulgance in achohol or wasting time in bars, as it were, not that I would judge those who do. All I am saying is I wouldn't go out of my way to promote any bar as such.</p>
<p>The history of the building and business are a part of the history of Tacoma. Some of the "tales" that surround the bar are also a part of that history, though not everything I included was necessary or incredibly substantial. I know that. I produced more information than needed with the hope that those who are involved in this site or those who are involved in my own community will contribute and make any changes if necessary. I was under the impression that this is how Wikipedia worked. I was not given ANY chance to produce this defense or make any corrections, clarifications, amendments, deletions or further verification. I was not even given a chance to post the "Hang On" as instructed in the original note informing me of my alleged abuses. At this point, the criticism of my post seems to have grown even more vague. Rules are rules, and I desperately want to follow them. I would not want to continue doing something detrimental to the Wikipedia community. If I were I would expect such a speedy response to my actions. I can see the point being made, however it simply doesn't apply. I can and would like to try to continue this project, and would like suggestions as to how to better write something so as not to offend someone with such delicate sensibilities in regrads to circumstances outside their realm of experience. I thought I took great care to eliminate personal bias, and present the place as it is. I actually felt I needed to refrain from being overly critical, but I am in the process of working in other angles as there is more information I would like to add. The social and economic fluxuations in the Tacoma community over the years that the bar lived and struggled through, perservering despite the odds as the city became as slum. And how the place still stands to this day as the city is reborn. That in itself is a good story, as our world changes and so often leaves little things like this behind. Progress is impersonal and not the least bit sentimental. At any time over these last 80 years this building could have been demolished, and relegated to a few fading memories. My personal opinion of the place is that it is a dump that could use better management to restore and maintain it, and help preserve it's historical heritage. That is a feeling of many in the community, and one I would also like to include in the article. This will give it a much more balanced appearance. As I am writing this statement right now, I can see that this is probably the biggest problem, the fact that it might have looked as though it were being presented in a totally positive light from an outsiders perspective. As though I were trying to pitch it, or promote a business. I have no interest in that. I do have a personal interst in preserving the history of my community in general wherever possible. Whatever the reasons are that this occured, I wish to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. There are a lot of things I would like to contribute to Wikipedia in regards to my community, and whatever else, should I be able to learn the proper format and presentation. But I don't know how someone outside of a particular community can determine the worth of something like this. I think had there been a little more varied information and if it were better formatted, along with all the needed sources to verify the information things might have been different. Then again, it is hard to say. Maybe my style of writing led you to believe that I was trying to sell people on the place or something. I could care less about the bar, but if someone put the effort into restoring, maintaining and exploiting that place I wouldn't mind. Not that this is a motivation for me either. I have no personal motivation or agenda with this story, which is exactly why I chose it.</p>
<p>Examples on Wikipedia of similar places to Bobs Java Jive; <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whisky_a_Go_Go_09f3.html" title="Whisky a Go Go">Whisky a Go Go</a> and <a href="../../../c/b/g/CBGB_7cf7.html" title="CBGB">CBGBs</a> are two examples of dive bars that are relevent to their immediate community and to a small peripheral subculture. The <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Bunyan_fb0f.html" title="Paul Bunyan">Paul Bunyan</a> roadside attraction in Northern California is a prime example of a rather large, odd, construction that is rarely seen anymore. Things like this are a slice of our countries history and culture. These three examples seem to be good reasons why my article should be allowed to develop. If I looked harder I think I would find even better examples.</p>
<p>As for verification, I did post a discussion page moments after my initial posting of the original article. On that page I explained that I was in the process at that moment of going through and including the information I needed to support it and that this was a work in progress (that process, of course, has since been interrupted, possibly indefinately, as I await a resolution of this situation). I explained that I was new to the system and requested patience and assistance from the Wikipedians. I also included three web addresses or links or what have you, one of which being one of the most recent Tacoma News Tribunes articles on the Jive, in which many of my statements can easily be verified. The story itself was in regards to the establishments most recent (and uncommon) closure. It detailed the code violations and inspection process, and delved into the history of the place. That publication could provide a wealth of information regarding the Java Jive from its archives. My point is, in one news paper story, much of what I state is confirmed. Was this source checked, and is an established and reputable local news paper not sufficient to use as verification of encylopedic data? I also thought that including the links to the pages of the four movies in which the bar has appeared was helpful verification, and I encourage you to watch them all to see for yourself. As was linking the bands who have performed there, members of these bands or people on their talk pages would easily and glady help verify this information.</p>
<p>All in all, the more I approach my explanations, and the more I learn of the process and the nature of Wikipedia, the more I expect that this article should and will be reinstated. I do agree that much of what I wrote needs some work, but that is what this community does. It improves upon itself from the contributions of everyone involved.</p>
<p>Please, once again, forgive me if I have been out of line. I sincerely am not mad. Forgive all the little mistakes and bad etiquette, I know I need to sign things like this and haven't done so on all, and I know most of the rules, just haven't "learned" them all yet, as I said. Also, forgive the length of my writing, I am not so much trying to convince you, as I am trying to explain myself. I hope I haven't come across as brash or insulting. I really do want to do a good job if I am going to do anything here, and don't mean to give you a headache or make more work for you by any means. Thanks again for your time and response, I do appreciate it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bonzzort (<a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonzzort_a147.html" title="User talk:Bonzzort">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonzzort_bc51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonzzort">contribs</a>) 07:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>On Wikipedia’s <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma.html" title="Tacoma">Tacoma</a> Washington page, under the heading “Tacoma in pop culture”, subheading “In film” it states the following:</p>
<p>“I Love You to Death (1990) was filmed in downtown and central Tacoma. Kevin Kline's pizzeria was located in the wedge-shaped Bostwick Building downtown. Also featured was the 1927-vintage Java Jive, a Tacoma tavern shaped like a giant coffee pot”</p>

<p>The link given as a source for verification is one I deemed not quite good enough to cite as a reference, although it apparently is. That leads me to believe that the first three were probably quite adequate as well. What I may now be understanding, is that I am supposed to put these sources on the front page, included as part of the article. Not on the discussion page where I had them initially. I am not sure if this makes a significant difference in terms of content or the manner in which I wrote.</p>
<p>Please let me know if any of this makes any difference and whether or not I can proceed with this subject, at your earliest convenience of course. I am up late and had time so I got in to this for a while. I don't expect any immediate response. Also, if I am approaching this inappropriately I am sorry. This is all new to me, and I am apparently missing some obvious points in the development process.</p>

<p>I seriously hope this isn’t considered spam, as I am only vaguely familiar with the term and not quite sure. Based on my understanding of the definition I can’t see how it would apply, nor do I see how promoting a business with my article applies either. It is incidental content.</p>
<p>Unless all the bands, bars, and every other similarly “unworthy” article is pulled from Wikipedia, I deserve a right to develop this piece. If there are fundamental flaws with format, then help me fix them. This is your obligation as editors. If there are problems with certain wording, or particular phrases, sentences or ideas that simply don’ t belong, then adjust or omit them. If there is a fact theat needs verification or is indeed false, correct it. Isn’t that what Wikipedia is about? I know that someone with more knowledge and experience could reformat this article in a matter of minutes and present it in a manner that would be suitable for publishing.</p>
