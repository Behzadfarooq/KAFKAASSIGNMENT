<p>Clement is the son of former <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Tennessee_5b33.html" title="Governor of Tennessee">Governor</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_G._Clement_cf6a.html" title="Frank G. Clement">Frank G. Clement</a>. During his father's third run for governor in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, Bob joined his father on the campaign trail, often making speeches when his father developed throat trouble.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clement graduated from <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsboro_High_School_9fbb.html" title="Hillsboro High School">Hillsboro High School</a> in Nashville. He went on to attend the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a>, graduating in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. He served in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> and also served in the reserves until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, retiring as a colonel. <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/02/09/22693610.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/02/09/22693610.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Clement considered buying a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> company while still at UT, but his father refused to lend him the money. However, he did learn quite a bit about the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Public_Service_Commission_8819.html" title="Tennessee Public Service Commission">Tennessee Public Service Commission</a>, which regulated phone companies and other utilities. He wanted to get a job on the commission's staff, but chairman Hammond Fowler kept blowing off his requests. When Fowler, who held the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Tennessee_a4d0.html" title="East Tennessee">East Tennessee</a> seat on the commission, ran for a fourth six-year term in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Clement ran against him in the Democratic primary. Bolstered in part by a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">televised</a> <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">debate</a> in which he appeared to be young and vibrant while Fowler appeared to be old and doddering, Clement won by an incredible 3-1 margin--the most lopsided defeat of a statewide incumbent in Tennessee history. He overwhelmed <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> nominee Tom Garland in the general election what was otherwise largely a very good year for Republicans in Tennessee (and nationwide) running for major offices. (No Republican was ever elected to the Public Service Commission in Tennessee during its existence, which later played a factor in its abolition more than 20 years later.) At 32, he was (and still is) the youngest person ever elected to statewide office in Tennessee history.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, Clement announced he would run for the Democratic nomination for governor. He ran second in the primary behind <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville</a> banker <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Butcher_c19e.html" title="Jake Butcher">Jake Butcher</a>, who had finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial primary four years previously and who had a level of name recognition roughly equal to Clement and, additionally, greater financial resources.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> tapped him for an unexpired term on the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Directors_5676.html" title="Board of Directors">Board of Directors</a> of the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Valley_Authority_87b5.html" title="Tennessee Valley Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, Clement announced his candidacy for the 7th Congressional District, his family's home district. The seat was being vacated by five-term incumbent Republican <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Beard_223a.html" title="Robin Beard">Robin Beard</a>, who was leaving it to run against <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Sasser_cddb.html" title="Jim Sasser">Jim Sasser</a>, and had been renumbered from the 6th in redistricting. Clement won the Democratic nomination, but lost the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a> to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Sundquist_15b3.html" title="Don Sundquist">Don Sundquist</a>, a businessman from <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> who would later become a two-term governor. It was the first (and as of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> elections, only) time that a Democrat had come within single digits in the 7th District and its predecessors since it fell into Republican hands in 1972. Clement said years later that he'd made a mistake by trying to run the same kind of campaign that his father had in his glory days.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean2_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Temporarily out of politics, Clement remained active in Democratic circles. He also had a large network of contacts through his ongoing service in the National Guard. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Clement became <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">president</a> of <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland_University_a7ec.html" title="Cumberland University">Cumberland College</a>, a struggling private <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_college.html" title="Junior college">junior college</a> 30 miles east of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville.html" title="Nashville">Nashville</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon%2C_Tennessee_a2a4.html" title="Lebanon, Tennessee">Lebanon</a>. Cumberland had once been one of the most prestigious <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">universities</a> in the South, but had fallen upon hard times, never fully recovering from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> and the widespread availability of lower-cost public higher education after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The low point in its problems probably occurred in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> when it was forced, for financial reasons, to sell its once-renowned <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland_School_of_Law_582d.html" title="Cumberland School of Law">law school</a> (which Clement's father had attended) to what is now <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samford_University_b30f.html" title="Samford University">Samford University</a> and downgrade to a junior college. During Clement's tenure, the school reobtained <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">four-year college</a>, and shortly later, full university status. He also tripled the school's private donations.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean2_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_Congressional_District_of_Tennessee_3264.html" title="5th Congressional District of Tennessee">5th District</a> Congressman <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Boner_ce98.html" title="Bill Boner">Bill Boner</a> left his House seat to become mayor of Nashville. Clement, who had moved to Nashville by this time, resigned as president of Cumberland on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a> to run in the Democratic primary for the balance of Boner's term. He won the nomination over a crowded field, including most prominently <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Bredesen_394a.html" title="Phil Bredesen">Phil Bredesen</a>, future mayor of Nashville and current governor of Tennessee, who finished second. As the Republicans had long since lost interest in a seat they hadn't won since <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> (Democrats have faced only token opposition since <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>), Clement's victory in the special election of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">January 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> was a foregone conclusion. He took office that night, as soon as the results were certified. He was unopposed for a full term in November and was reelected six times with no substantive opposition. <a href="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1712" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1712" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Despite representing one of the most Democratic districts in the country, Clement had a reputation for working across party lines. This nonpartisan style dated back to his first campaign for the Public Service Commission.<sup id="_ref-Tennessean2_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tennessean2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
