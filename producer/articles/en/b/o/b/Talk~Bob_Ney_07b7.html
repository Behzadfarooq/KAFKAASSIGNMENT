<p>The original authors made no attempt at a proper encyclopedic introduction of Bob Ney the lifelong public servant. Instead they have chosen to make this article merely about a 5 month old investigation with only a smattering of information on the man as a whole.</p>
<p>I've tried to add a couple small things to add context to this non-encyclopedic smear piece. I can't claim to have the ability to make it encyclopedic, but I will continue to try to place the stuff of high-emotion allegations into some sort of meaningful context. --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 02:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the original article may have been a smear peice, I'm afraid that your corrections are "counter-smear", rather than straigtening things out. Caling Abramoff and informant, and then claiming that _they_ are making the allegations (rather than the prosecutor) is just one example. Others including what seems to be blaming the Wash Post for starting the whole thing, and so forth. Some of this ought to be removed. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 19:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Check your facts. Unless some indictment has been released in the last few minutes, no allegations have been made by the prosecutor.
<dl>
<dd>I totally do not comprehend your statement. The prosecutor is the one who <i>writes</i> the indictment. So, of course the allegations were made by the prosecutor. Abramoff was charged with bribing a Congressman to insert comments in the Congressional Record. Abramoff admitted it. Ney inserted the comments. What facts do I need to check? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 20:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, we'll need a lawyer to sort this out. I can only find an indictment for the Florida charges and a plea agreement from the DC Public Ethics office. In either case, the agreement was to guilt in "conspiracy to violate the following federal laws...: (3) bribary and honest services fraud of public officials". That does not seem to me to be any official accusation of any government official. --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 21:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I'm not a lawyer, but saying that Jane conspired to bribe Sue and saying that Sue accepted and acted upon a bribe are two different things.

<dd>A couple of things: (a) I am a lawyer; (b) whether he was charged for the acts or for the conspiracy, the facts alleged by the government (and this is what our entire discussion is about -- what was alleged by the government) include directs acts of bribery. See paragraphs 32 and subsequent ones in Attachment A of <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abramoff/usabrmff10306plea.pdf" class="external free" title="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abramoff/usabrmff10306plea.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abramoff/usabrmff10306plea.pdf</a> .

<p>Well, we seem to have gone from incendiary blogger post to law review <i>news of note</i>. There must be some happy middle which spells out the story in a way that helps the students of America understand what is really going on here. I'm not saying that this is purely a case of a con now claiming what he will to get time off (see <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> ) and a excited prosecutorial team jumping at the chance to be famous. But I'm also shocked to learn that Bob Ney even plays golf. There just isn't that much time when you fly 700 miles and cover a district as large as the 18th <i>every</i> weekend. Can't we tell students something more about the case of the high rolling fibber vs. the man once named "Poorest Congressman"? --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 23:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you have any verifiable/linkable source about Ney traveling to his district every weekend, then by all means add some text and the source/link in the article. Or just post the link here; I'll be happy to add text from it if you want. Ditto for "poorest Congressman" - I ran a google search on that phrase, and got essentially nothing pertaining to anyone in the U.S. Congress, let alone to Bob Ney. (It's almost as if "poorest Congressman" is an oxymoron.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, the larger point is that we know nothing at all about Bob Ney from this article. If the writers who started this were interested in telling students about Bob Ney, they would have checked on a few things and added them. They would mention that his district is spread out over 5 television markets, and mention that he often puts up his own campaign signs deep into the night. Think you that they came here and wrote out of an interest in educating people about an Appalachian Congressman? Or maybe a different purpose? --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 05:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You wrote: "help the students of America understand what is really going on here." That's exactly what I'm attempting to do. I'm just noting the facts. Prosecutors charged that Abramoff bribed Ney (no, not just conspiracy (which was count #1), but the bribery itself (which is count #2)), and Abramoff pleaded guilty to it. It's that simple. I have tried to stay away from adjectives, which are often subjective ("excited prosecutorial team", "high rolling fibber", etc.). As far as your shock at Ney playing golf, I don't understand the relevance of your comment. Are you trying to say you don't believe it? Travel records show that Abramoff and Ney travelled to Scotland for a golf trip. (Whether they actually played golf is irrelevent, and nobody accused him of playing golf). Ney's statements about SunCruz, etc., are in the Congressional record. Emails from Abramoff talk about money credited to Ney. It's all there in black and white. It's a sad story, but what we have here is indeed factual and not misleading. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 03:25, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry I am not expressing this better; maybe I have seen too much of the world and you too little. Yes, it appears to be black and white to you. It certainly does not appear black and white to those of us who have watched these things play out before. Circumstantial evidence falls apart; prosecutorial theories dry up; cases fold. Yet the 17 year old who does his current events research gets just the black - nothing from the article to indicate that there are many reasons we might have a plea agreement which ends up meaning nothing at all at the end of the day.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Among the deep problems with this case are 1) credibility of the witness and 2) motive. Jack Abramoff appears to be about as non-credible a person as you might ever encounter. Bob Ney on the other hand, would seem to have nothing at all to gain from selling favors for campaign contributions: he will be backed to the hilt by the RNC, NRCC, etc, etc as the election approaches. And selling statements for golf - well I suppose there are people that shallow, but Ney sure does more work here than he needs to if that's the life he wants to live. Heck, if that's what he wanted, the thing to do would be leave Congress and join a lobbying firm. --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 05:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Further, the facts speak for themselves: Ney <b>did</b> go on those trips, Ney <b>did</b> get campaign money, Ney <b>did</b> get other favors from Abramoff, Ney <b>did</b> insert statements about SunCruz into the Congressional Record; former chief of staff, Volz, <b>did</b> leave Ney's office to work as a lobbyist, and so forth. The only fact in dispute is if there was a <i>quid pro quo</i> -- but that is, in fact, what the prosecutor charged and what Abramoff pled guilty to. In any event, the article itself never says Ney was bribed, it only says that these are allegations. Which is entirely correct -- these are official and documented allegations. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 01:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Unbelievable</i> is Bill Clinton lobbying for Dubai Ports World, getting paid $600,000 for it, and his wife standing on the national stage denouncing the deal as harmful to national security. <i>Golf tees</i> are just golf tees.</li>
<li>Though now you mention it, ...given the Prosecutors theory that Ney sold statements in the Congressional record for campaign donations,... why in the world would the campaign bother with such small efforts as golf tees when powerful commercials could be bought with the extreme profits of selling congressional favors?</li>
<li>Still wish you would remove the insufficient section from this article and place it in the Abramoff Scandal article with the rest of the allegations. --<a href="../../../e/j/0/User%7EEj0c_d5ac.html" title="User:Ej0c">Ej0c</a> 21:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I looked at the Abramoff section in the article. To make sure it's fair, I expanded the rebuttal by Ney. As far as moving the text to the Abramoff section, that makes no sense - the text is about Ney; if anything, the cross-reference should be from the Abramoff article to this one. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 00:21, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The line concerning the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is really non-POV. CREW is definitely a liberal group as can be gleaned from their <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activities.html" title="Activities">http://www.citizensforethics.org/activities/index.php</a> page. All activities center on attacking members of the Republican party. Opposing the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT:most likely a conservative backed group) is an example of deviating from their stated cause. If the line is to be left in, it should be noted that the group makes a habit of primarily attacking conservative and Republican issues/persons. 138.145.211.130 13:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>At first I deleted it, but then thought better of it. I added in another heading to give the line proper context instead of passing it off as a mainstream research group. 138.145.211.130 13:38, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In general, extensive information about CREW should be in the article about that group, not in the Bob Ney article. That's the purpose of having the link, and a seperate article. In fact, a few days ago I moved some information on CREW that was in the Bob Ney article to the CREW article, since it wasn't there. (I consider the current "three-person liberal group" description to be in a grey area; while one can argue it should only be in the CREW article, it does provide the reader the quick context that can be helpful.)

<p>By the way, I should say a word on behalf of my friend Eva Lunder, economic develoment director for Belmont county.

<dd>That wording, as is the case with much of the article, comes from a news article; it's not something that anyone made up. I'm not sure what you're saying here - on the one hand, your friend wouldn't appreciate the description; on the other hand, it (maybe) adequately represents the situation. In any case, either it is true (in which case your friend's feelings are really irrelevant; a lot of people don't happen to like accurate descriptions); or it's not, in which case it would be great if you or someone else would edit it to be more accurate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 02:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Intersting you mention that, as I was thinking that that section needed re-organization, too. I think that

<li>4 Connections to Abramoff Indian Gambling Scandal</li>
<li>5 Connections to the SunCruz Casinos Scandal</li>
<li>6 Involvement in U.S. sanctions on arms sales to Iran</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>should be grouped together under a larger title (perhaps something like, "political controversies"), and each of the above would be subheadings. As for "Criticism for corruption" -- it should be wrapped into either "political career", or the new section I've just proposed.

<p>This article has simply become silly. It has no relation whatsoever to the traditional form of an encyclopedia article.

<dl>
<dd>EjOc - you've been a consistent critic of adding much of anything that could be seen as negative for Bob Ney, and apparently quite a disbeliever in what everyone else sees as (accumulating) evidence against Bob Ney. I don't know if you think he's to be indicted (I'd be happy to give you 10-1 odds that he will be, by the Department of Justice of a Republican administration), and I'd guess that you think he won't be convicted. You might consider that you're in a small minority here; do you really think all this is because government prosecutors have nothing better to do? Bob Ney is going down in history as the Congressman most closely tied to convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and that's what should be in the wikipedia article. And what is most interesting to readers, now, is where things are in the process of bring Ney to trial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a challenge: (a) find (useful) denials and counter-facts that Ney and his supporters have put out (my sense is that Ney has responding to specific accusations with blanket denials and a lack of details; I'd be happy to be shown wrong), and add them to the article; (b) find missing "context" from <b>reputable</b> newspapers and magazines (let's say the Washington Post, New York Times, Boston Globe, LA Times, Newsweek, and Time Magazine, as starters), and add that to the article, with a citation. When you can do (a) and/or (b), I'll be happy to defend keeping your additions in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 22:10, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
