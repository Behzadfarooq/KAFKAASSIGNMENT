<p><b>Bob Arno</b>, born <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, is known primarily as a comedy <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickpocket.html" title="Pickpocket">pickpocket</a> entertainer and more recently as a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminologist.html" title="Criminologist">criminologist</a> specializing in global <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_crime.html" title="Street crime">street crime</a>.</p>
<p>Arno's stage pickpocket performance is billed as comedy, though it includes some decidedly unfunny moments which, nevertheless, fascinate and impress audience members. First among these is his incorporation of documentary-style video which is projected during his presentation. As described in a March 9, 2004 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/09/business/09flier.html?ex=1158379200&amp;en=eff4301b6c8b7e1c&amp;ei=5070" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/09/business/09flier.html?ex=1158379200&amp;en=eff4301b6c8b7e1c&amp;ei=5070" rel="nofollow">article</a> in <i>The New York Times,</i> the video is footage shot by himself and his wife, Bambi Vincent, of criminal pickpockets and other street thieves before, during, and after committing their crimes. This "reality factor" contributes greatly to the presentation's originality and adds elements of awe and enlightenment that give it depth beyond comedy.</p>
<p>Unlike most other performers in the small, specialized field of pickpocket entertainment, Arno does not present magical effects for their own sake. He does incorporate principles of magic in much the same manner that criminal pickpockets, con artists, and other street thieves do. And, given that his show is comedy, he is not above preparing a volunteer on occasion to enhance his humorous finale. Regardless, Arno's thievery skills are legendary. <a href="http://www.bluemoontalent.com/bob-arno.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bluemoontalent.com/bob-arno.html" rel="nofollow">Blue Moon Talent Agency</a> says "Nothing a victim possesses is safe from Bob Arno's lightning lifts." He has perfected the art of the steal to include neckties, suspenders, glasses, belts, cell phones, wallets, and pocket contents, as well as watches.</p>
<p>In 1993, looking to expand the show, Arno and his wife wondered if they could bring elements from the street to the stage. They began a serious study of street criminals, filming them in the act of tricking and/or stealing from victims, and interviewing them when possible. "Wearing hidden camera and recording equipment, they do everything they can to put themselves in the thick of the action," according to <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LVRB&amp;p_theme=lvrb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=Picking%20AND%20Pockets%20AND%20to%20AND%20Make%20AND%20a%20AND%20Point&amp;s_dispstring=Picking%20Pockets%20to%20Make%20a%20Point%20AND%20date(2/1/2004%20to%203/1/2004)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2/1/2004%20to%203/1/2004)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no" class="external text" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LVRB&amp;p_theme=lvrb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=Picking%20AND%20Pockets%20AND%20to%20AND%20Make%20AND%20a%20AND%20Point&amp;s_dispstring=Picking%20Pockets%20to%20Make%20a%20Point%20AND%20date(2/1/2004%20to%203/1/2004)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2/1/2004%20to%203/1/2004)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no" rel="nofollow"><i>Las Vegas Review Journal</i></a>. Arno and Vincent began calling themselves "thief-hunters" and soon amassed a valuable film archive of a little-documented crime.</p>
<p>In the preface of their book (see below), Arno and Vincent claim to have initially suffered inner turmoil created by failing to prevent incidents occurring in their presence, but they overcame that discomfort after realizing the value of their study. Certainly they were able to port street techniques to the stage, as originally hoped. But the video footage and interviews garnered interest from law enforcement and security agencies, while the video mixed with anecdotes and lessons became a popular lecture to laymen.</p>
<p>Thus began Arno's career as a criminologist and speaker. His study had begun much earlier with observations of soldiers on R&amp;R leave in Asia during the 60s. On May 11, 1969, a front page profile written by Brian Moynahan in the London <i>Sunday Times</i> called Arno "one of the world's pickpocketing experts." In the four-column article Arno describes theft risks peculiar to various Asian countries and compares victim reaction by nationality. In its June 20, 1969 issue, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a> magazine wrote: "One of the world's foremost experts in the techniques of first-rank 'wires' (or 'cannons' or 'pit workers') is Bob Arno, a 29-year-old Swede whose demonstrations onstage and in nightclubs earn him more than $100,000 a year." In a January 9, 1981 article entitled "Beware the Stiff-Armed Stranger; He May be Lifting Your Wallet," <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> quoted "Robert [sic] Arno, a Miami, Fla., pickpocketing expert who's advised police in various countries."</p>
<p>In 1993, armed with video cameras to document his findings, Arno revived his research in earnest. His knowledge base started with common and specialized forms of street thievery, and later grew to include off-the-street theft from tourists. His expertise now includes identity theft, laptop theft, credit card fraud and internet scams. He lectures to lay audiences and presents training for law enforcement and security, and other government agencies in the United States and abroad. With Vincent, he is co-author of the book <i>Travel Advisory: How to Avoid Thefts, Cons, and Street Scams</i> (Bonus Books, 2003).</p>

<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../b/o/b/Image%7EBobarnowallet.jpg_1a7e.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/0/0a/Bobarnowallet.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="260" longdesc="../../../b/o/b/Image%7EBobarnowallet.jpg_1a7e.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>At age 15, Arno began performing magic at youth centers in his native Sweden and was successful enough to tour the country for several years. He briefly experimented with hypnotism before settling on pickpocketing, having been inspired by "Dominique" Risbourg, the reigning pickpocket performer of the time. When Dominique had an extended run in Stockholm in 1956, he solicited the local Magic Circle for an assistant, and Arno volunteered.</p>
<p>From age 20 to 23, Arno toured Asia with his pickpocket show, working nightclubs and U.S. military bases. From 23 to 25 he toured across Europe working nightclubs and theaters. At 25 he worked for two months at the Latin Quarter in New York, which began his career in America. He worked steadily from then on, mostly in casino revues, moving from Atlantic City to the Caribbean to Canada to Las Vegas. In 1992, after many years in Las Vegas and three years (1990-1992) in the <i>Jubilee!</i> show at Bally's Casino there, he quit his casino revue career in order to travel with his wife. Cruise ships served a triple purpose in the 90s: a steady income as a performing venue; exotic world travel; and putting Arno in the middle of huge tourist crowds, which is generally where pickpockets operate. These crowds, primarily in the great cities of Europe, but also in Asia, Africa, and South America, were the inspiration for Arno's criminal pickpocket research. The study soon became the motivation for further cruise ship engagements.</p>
<p>The 90s also saw Arno in theater productions. He starred in his own show with Swedish comedian John Houdi at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berns_Salonger_264a.html" title="Berns Salonger">Berns Salonger</a> in Stockholm, performed at the Lido in Amsterdam, at Liseberg and <a href="../../../g/r/%C3%B6/Gr%C3%B6na_Lund_c160.html" title="Gröna Lund">Gröna Lund</a> in Sweden, at theaters in Sydney, and at <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_City%2C_North_West_7d0e.html" title="Sun City, North West">Sun City, North West</a>. He also began performing at private corporate events, which is currently his main focus along with keynote speaking and law enforcement training.</p>
