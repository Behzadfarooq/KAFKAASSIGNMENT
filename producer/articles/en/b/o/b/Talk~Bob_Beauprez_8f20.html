<p>The neutrality of this article is in dispute, because the rhetoric used in the controversies sections presents the allegations (many of which have since been proven false) as facts. Also, the presentation of the military visits as posturing is a matter of perspective, since one could just as easily say that he was supporting the troops by visiting their base. An ideological slant is clear in much of this article, particuarly in that last section.</p>
<p>This article is being used in Republican circles as part of an example of how Democrats are using Wikipedia to puff their own candidates and demonize Republicans. 1) A flight suit does not become a uniform until military insignia and badges are attached. There are no insignia or badges on Beaupreaz's flight suit. Without badges, it is simply a safety garment. The claim that military veterans objected to him (or any other politician) wearing a safety garmet on a routine demonstration flight is laughable. You can find anyone to complain about anything and document it, but before it makes it into a candidate's Wikipedia bio, the claim needs to pass a sanity test. This doesn't. The photo and the comments need to go. 2) The NCIC issue leaves out the important information that the Denver Post discovered and reported that no one has ever been prosecuted for the unauthorized release of NCIC data. This section is outsized for its significance. A line or two would be more appropriate, and then emphasizing its impact on the campaign. 3) The comment in the chairmanship section that he "was marked by an aggressive attempts to use redistricting to get more Republican candidates elected in Colorado" ignores the historic fact that the Democrats controlled redistricting that year and gerrymandered so effectively that in subsequent elections the Democrats lose the aggragate popular vote for legislative candidates by tens, (60,000 in 2006) and sometimes hundreds of thousands of votes and still control the legislature. It is hard to "use" redistricting "aggressively" when you don't control the process. I could go on, but I have passed the 100 word limit. This is my first entry anywhere in Wikipedia. If I have broken any rules, please note them and I will do better next time. Thanks.Bronze Knight 20:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Beaucredo: removing anything that reflects badly on Beauprez and putting "grow up ou slimey p.o.s." as your edit reason isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>Beaucredo, buzz off. You're some damp-eyed, easily bruised GOP operative with a tenuous grasp of English. I know Mexican immigrants who write better than you. Leave the military debate segment in. It gives some proper context to that bogus flight suit campaign photo.</p>
<p>Beauprez campaign is inserting disinformation and removing negative information.</p>
<p>None of the allegations against DeLay have been proven. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Earle_985e.html" title="Ronnie Earle">Ronnie Earle</a>, the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Delay_eec9.html" title="Tom Delay">Tom Delay</a> prosecutor, has a history of indictments against Democrat and Republican political enemies that have failed (see <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Bailey_Hutchison_2c55.html" title="Kay Bailey Hutchison">Kay Bailey Hutchison</a>) and it has been widely reported that Earle had to shop the charges to several grand juries because some refused to indict. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200510060733.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200510060733.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> One of the charges filed by Earle was summarily dismissed by trial judge <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Priest_%28judge%29_d40d.html" title="Pat Priest (judge)">Pat Priest</a>. Earle has partnered up with producers making a movie, called The Big Buy, about his pursuit of DeLay that has been filming since before DeLay was notified of the charges. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200510041617.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200510041617.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200509291814.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200509291814.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200509301738.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200509301738.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>This was added because the added statement about Tom Delay is an unproven allegation that is used to make the member of congress guilty by association. Especially when there is much evidence that Ronnie Earle's indictments are politically motivated. You cannot include one side of an unproven allegation and not include the other, to do so would be unfair and biased.</p>

In 2005, DeLay was <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indicted</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felony.html" title="Felony">felony</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a> charges by <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_attorney.html" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Earle_985e.html" title="Ronnie Earle">Ronnie Earle</a>. While DeLay has not been convicted of any crime, and no one has accused Beauprez of misconduct, the charges against DeLay have led Democrats to call on Beauprez to return the money or to donate it to charity. <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/issues_and_campaigns/accountablecongress/delay/money9.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ourfuture.org/issues_and_campaigns/accountablecongress/delay/money9.cfm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Republicans say that the charges against DeLay are politically motivated because prosecutor <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Earle_985e.html" title="Ronnie Earle">Ronnie Earle</a> has a history of unsuccessful indictments against political enemies of both parties such as <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Bailey_Hutchison_2c55.html" title="Kay Bailey Hutchison">Kay Bailey Hutchison</a> (R-TX), and because Earle had to shop the charges to multiple grand juries because one refused to indict. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200510060733.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200510060733.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/10/5earle.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/10/5earle.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>This is how the paragrapgh should read for the following reasons. The charges agaonst DeLay are brought by an ackowledged partisan. Ronnie Earle has stated that he will "get DeLay" at a Democratic fundraiser, this is not in dispute. Earle has a history of failed indictments against his political enemies of both parties, this fact is also not in rational dispute. If people insist that the DeLay reference be included in the main article, fairness and article neutrality demand that both sides of the story be told and not just the DNC talking points version of them.

<p>Are any of the first three or four (Legal issues, ARMPAC contributions, Michael Cherney, or Military Service) a serious controversy? If not, let's get rid of it. FWIW, the fifth one, which I just added (NCIC database) is an example (imho) of a real controversy, as it has been headlining the Colorado local papers, and involves an FBI investigation.
