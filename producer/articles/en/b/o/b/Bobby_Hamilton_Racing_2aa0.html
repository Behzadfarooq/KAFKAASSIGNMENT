The elder Hamilton debuted the team in 1997 at <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartland_Park_Topeka_9c38.html" title="Heartland Park Topeka">Heartland Park Topeka</a>, as the #1 <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet.html" title="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> sponsored by Southern Pride Trucking.

He ran another race that year at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinsville_Speedway_3494.html" title="Martinsville Speedway">Martinsville Speedway</a>, as the #51. He finished fifth in that race. Hamilton ran three races the next year, but suffered mechanical failures in each of them.

<p>The #8 truck debuted in 2001 with <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_T._Ribbs_1fe8.html" title="Willy T. Ribbs">Willy T. Ribbs</a> as the driver. In his rookie season, Ribbs drove in 23 races and had three top-twenty finishes, finishing 16th in points, but was replaced by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Lester_d0c7.html" title="Bill Lester">Bill Lester</a> in 2002.

The team was then sold to Julius Curry, and attempted the spring race at Atlanta with Montgomery, but failed to qualify.
