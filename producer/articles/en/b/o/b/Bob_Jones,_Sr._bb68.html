<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Sr._bb68.html" title="Edit section: Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Years</span></h2>
<p>The son of William Alexander and Georgia (Creel) Jones, the eleventh of twelve children, Bob Jones was born on a farm in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_County_647f.html" title="Dale County">Dale County</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> but within months moved with his family to Brannon Stand east of <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dothan.html" title="Dothan">Dothan</a>. All the Jones children had to work the farm, and Bob Jones often sold the family vegetables door-to-door in <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dothan.html" title="Dothan">Dothan</a>. Jones later recalled, "We may have been a little undernourished, but we built some character."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jones's elementary schooling was sketchy by modern standards, but the boy early exhibited oratorical ability. Alex Jones had Bob memorize passages from the Bible and literature, and Bob, who was "timid and self-conscious," was regularly called on to perform for guests. Jones later recalled, "I did whatever my father said to do, but when he told me to 'say the speech,' I suffered agony that nobody could possibly know."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jones must have quickly overcame his stagefright, however, for by 1895, as a twelve-year-old, he gave a spirited, twenty-minute defense of the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist_Party_%28United_States%29_a236.html" title="Populist Party (United States)">Populist Party</a> while standing on a dry-goods box in front of a Dothan drug store. His gifts were recognized by Dr. Charles Jefferson Hammitt (1858-1935), a Methodist missionary from Philadelphia and principal of Mallalieu Seminary (1882-1923), a Methodist school in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinsey.html" title="Kinsey">Kinsey</a>. Jones boarded with the Hammitts and helped pay his board by serving the household, even taking orders from the Hammitt children. Jones graduated from Mallalieu in 1900, and the following year he entered Southern College (later <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham-Southern_College_55dd.html" title="Birmingham-Southern College">Birmingham-Southern College</a>) at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greensboro%2C_Alabama_269d.html" title="Greensboro, Alabama">Greensboro</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, supporting himself with his preaching. He attended until 1904 but by then was already so prominent as an evangelist that he left without taking a degree, in part to help support two widowed sisters.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time Jones was 17, both his father and mother were dead. In 1905, Jones married Bernice Sheffield, who contracted tuberculosis and died within ten months of their marriage. On June 17, 1908, he married Mary Gaston Stollenwerck, whom he had met as a choir member during a meeting he was conducting in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniontown%2C_Alabama_3d16.html" title="Uniontown, Alabama">Uniontown, Alabama</a>. Their only child, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Jr._a9a0.html" title="Bob Jones, Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> was born October 19, 1911 in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery%2C_Alabama_2176.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery</a>, where they made their home. Mary Gaston Jones died on May 12, 1989 in her 101st year--83 years after the death of her husband's first wife.</p>

<p>Jones's family was devoutly Christian--his mother a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_Baptist_fd8c.html" title="Primitive Baptist">Primitive Baptist</a> and his father an "immersed" Methodist. The family attended a nearby <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> church where Bob Jones was converted at age 11. But as a portent of Jones's later non-denominationalism, he too was baptized by immersion before joining the Methodists.</p>
<p>At age 12, Jones was made Sunday School superintendent, and he held his first revival meeting at his home church--seeing sixty conversions in a single week. At thirteen, he built a "brush arbor" shelter and organized his own congregation of 54 members. By age 15, Jones was a licensed circuit preacher for the Alabama <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annual_Conference_6750.html" title="Annual Conference">Conference</a>. A year later, he was called to the Headland Circuit of five churches, including the one he had started, and he was earning $25 a month for his labors. Jones later wondered that "the devil did not trap me....I was pulled here and there and from house to house. People flocked to hear me preach. The buildings could not hold the crowds; people even stood outside and stuck their heads in the windows to listen. It's a wonder it did not spoil me." <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>American evangelistic meetings received more newspaper publicity at the turn of the twentieth century than before or since and were often boosted by the town fathers out of civic pride. Bob Jones meetings were frequently front-page news for weeks in the cities where he held meetings. By the 1920s, Jones was probably the best-known evangelist in the United States except for <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a>. His campaign results were remarkable even for the era. For instance, in a seven-week campaign in <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanesville%2C_Ohio_6650.html" title="Zanesville, Ohio">Zanesville, Ohio</a> (1917), a town of 22,000, there were 3,384 converts, of whom 2,200 joined churches on Easter Sunday. In 1921, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskingum_College_571e.html" title="Muskingum College">Muskingum College</a>, a Presbyterian school, became the first of several institutions to confer honorary doctorates on Jones.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><a href="http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=144" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=144" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>By the time he was 40, Jones had preached to more than fifteen million people face-to-face and without amplification, and he was credited with tens of thousands of conversions. (Unlike <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a>, Jones was reluctant to keep tabulated records of his results.) Crowds might be as large as 15,000 at a time, virtually necessitating the sustained volume, hyperbolic language, and extravagant gestures that became stereotypical characteristics of period evangelists. (In Zanesville, Jones pounded the pulpit so hard that he broke it.)</p>

<p>During the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s, Jones grew increasingly concerned with the secularization of higher education. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jennings_Bryan_d775.html" title="William Jennings Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winona_Lake%2C_Indiana_cbae.html" title="Winona Lake, Indiana">Winona Lake, Indiana</a>, and said, "If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists." <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In early April 1925--some months before the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scopes_Trial_c943.html" title="Scopes Trial">Scopes Trial</a>--Jones and his wife were driving in south Florida talking about the need for an orthodox Christian college as an alternative to what he perceived to be loss of both state and denominational colleges to secularism. After stopping for some sandwiches, Jones announced, "just as a clap of thunder out of a clear sky," that he was going to found such a school. His wife's first response was, "Robert, are you crazy?" Jones immediately turned the car north and began consulting with friends in Alabama and north Florida about a location.</p>
<p>On April 14, the charter was approved by the circuit court in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_City%2C_Florida_9cfa.html" title="Panama City, Florida">Panama City, Florida</a>, and a plan based on real estate sales was concocted to raise money for the college. On December 1, 1926, ground was broken on <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Andrews_Bay_6822.html" title="St. Andrews Bay">St. Andrews Bay</a> near <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Haven%2C_Florida_8d58.html" title="Lynn Haven, Florida">Lynn Haven, Florida</a>, and the college opened on September 12, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> with 88 students. Jones said that although he was averse to naming the school after himself his friends overcame his reluctance "with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Bob Jones took no salary from the college, and in fact, for years afterward, he helped support the school through personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_land_boom.html" title="Florida land boom">Florida land boom</a> had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived bankruptcy and its move to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Tennessee_47a7.html" title="Cleveland, Tennessee">Cleveland, Tennessee</a> in 1933. Nevertheless, the reputation of both the school and its founder continued to grow, and with the enactment of <a href="../../../g/i/_/GI_Bill_3d1a.html" title="GI Bill">GI Bill</a> at the end of World War II, the college was virtually forced to seek a new location and build a new campus. In 1947, the school moved to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_South_Carolina_7db2.html" title="Greenville, South Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a>, where it was re-named <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Bob Jones University">Bob Jones University</a>.</p>
<p>By that time, oversight of day-to-day operations had long since passed to his son, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Jr._a9a0.html" title="Bob Jones, Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> Nevertheless, the elder Jones continued to raise money, preach regularly at chapel services, and provide inspiration to the hundreds of ministerial students who flooded the campus during the 1950s and revered him as "Doctor Bob." Gradually, during the early '60s, he began to suffer "hardening of the arteries" and was forced to retire to the University infirmary in 1966. Despite mental confusion, his prayers were said to have remained bell-clear virtually to the end.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>As it turned out, new mass entertainment, such as radio and movies, helped put an end to an era of city-wide evangelism typified by the ministries of Bob Jones and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a>. But Jones was not afraid of technological progress per se and believed that the new media might provide additional opportunities to spread the gospel. During the early 1920s Jones was one of the first religious figures to broadcast on radio. The 1925 Bob Jones evangelistic meetings in Pittsburgh were perhaps the first remote-controlled religious broadcasts in the world, as well as the first broadcasts to originate from an evangelistic crusade. (In the same year, Jones also made a religious film, which because of its graphic--for the era--portrayal of certain sins, was slashed into an "unrecognizable mess" by the Pennsylvania State Censorship Board.)</p>
<p>In 1927, the year that network radio was launched in the United States, Jones began both a daily and weekly network program heard from New York to Alabama; and despite his other responsibilities, he maintained an uninterrupted radio ministry for 35 years until his health failed in 1962. In 1944, Jones became a founder of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Religious_Broadcasters_5ca5.html" title="National Religious Broadcasters">National Religious Broadcasters</a> and served as a director.</p>
<p>Jones understood that the manner of delivery necessary to declaim to thousands unamplified was unsuited to the new medium, and his radio sermons were instead delivered in an intimate, folksy manner. Perhaps three thousand of his approximately ten thousand radio messages survive, and recordings are still nationally syndicated.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Sr._bb68.html" title="Edit section: Religious Views">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Religious Views</span></h2>
<p>Theologically, Jones was a Protestant in the Reformation tradition. One of his first concerns when he founded Bob Jones College was to provide a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed.html" title="Creed">creed</a> that would embody the fundamentals of the Christian faith. The Bob Jones University creed (composed by <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Constitution_433a.html" title="Atlanta Constitution">Atlanta Constitution</a></i> columnist Sam Small) was an abbreviated statement of traditional orthodoxy, emphasisizing those aspects of the faith that were under attack during the early twentieth century.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Therefore the BJC creed affirmed the inspiration of the Bible and rejected the theory of human evolution as necessary tenets of Christian belief.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the tension between his mother’s <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_Baptist_fd8c.html" title="Primitive Baptist">Primitive Baptist</a> views and his own long-standing membership in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> Church, Jones sought to split the difference between <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arminianism.html" title="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>. He urged his hearers to believe that “whatever the Bible says is so,” even if its words did not fit a particular theological system. Although Jones believed that man was depraved by nature and that salvation was through Christ and by grace alone, yet his early revival sermons stressed opposition to social sins such as drinking, dancing, and Sabbath desecration and the possibility that they might be ameliorated by legislation as well as by individual repentance. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jones's view of academic learning was also practical; he advocated Christian higher education yet insisted that faith could not rest on human argument. Jones was skeptical of both the intellectual emphasis of the Reformed tradition and the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietism.html" title="Pietism">pietism</a> of the "deeper life" movement. He could quote <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goethe.html" title="Goethe">Goethe</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/c/Cicero.html" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> without affectation, but he urged his students to make “truth simple and easy to grasp”—to put “the fodder on the ground” and give “all the animals from giraffe to a billy-goat” an equal chance to understand the gospel. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1950s, Jones played an important, if unwelcome, role in the division of orthodox Protestantism into <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalism</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-evangelicalism.html" title="Neo-evangelicalism">neo-evangelicalism</a>. The severance, which had already been bruited about in some conservative seminaries, became actual with the rise to prominence of evangelist <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the University had conferred an honorary degree on him in 1948. In the 1940s Jones and Graham seemed to have developed something of a father-son relationship. During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism, and in 1957, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship for his New York Crusade. Jones argued that because members of Graham’s campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_birth.html" title="Virgin birth">virgin birth</a> and the deity of Christ, Graham had therefore violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do “not abide in the teaching of Christ.” Members of Graham’s organization accused Jones of jealousy because Graham was now attracting larger crowds than any who had ever heard Jones. Jones wrote wearily that he was an old man who did not want to “get into a battle” but that he would not go “back on the Lord Jesus Christ.” The notoriety of the Graham-Jones split marked a more-or-less permanent division among Bible-believers into smaller fundamentalist and larger evangelical factions. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jones enjoyed politics and was the friend of many politicians. Had he not believed that preaching was a higher calling, he might have run for office himself as he was occasionally encouraged to do. During the 1928 presidential election, Jones campaigned throughout the South for Republican <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> against Democrat <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Smith_22a8.html" title="Al Smith">Al Smith</a>. Smith, he claimed, would be unduly influenced by the Pope, who Jones said was to Catholics "the voice of God." <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Jones's support for Hoover, though quixotic in 1928, was perhaps the earliest harbinger of the demise of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_South_d12f.html" title="Solid South">Solid South</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, Jones, like <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a> (who was an Iowan), accepted contributions for his evangelistic campaigns from the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Jones also supported members of the Klan, notably his friend, Alabama Governor <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibb_Graves_faa4.html" title="Bibb Graves">Bibb Graves</a>, for political office. Although Jones rejected lawlessness and lynching, he sympathized with the Klan's professed endorsement of religious orthodoxy, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>, and opposition to the teaching of evolution as fact. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">Racial segregation</a> per se was hardly an issue in 1920s Alabama because at the time both supporters and opponents of the Klan were segregationists.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jones remained a segregationist into the era of the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_movement_9e96.html" title="Civil Rights movement">Civil Rights movement</a>, when he was in his 70s. There are few references to race in Jones's sermons and chapel messages until the late 1950s, but in a 1960 radio address, Jones declared that God had been the author of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a> and that opposition to segregation was opposition to God.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Jones's health had failed before the integration of neighboring <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furman_University_ea96.html" title="Furman University">Furman University</a> in 1965, and he did not live to see the abandonment of segregation, six years later, at Bob Jones University.</p>

<p>During the heyday of city-wide evangelism, the revivalists often created epigramatic quotations that could be published in the daily newspaper--the early twentieth-century version of the "sound bite." Bob Jones, Sr. used the English language creatively, and his "chapel sayings," which he repeated for generations during the BJU chapel hour, continue to hang in classrooms of the University he founded. The following are a sample:<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the job.</li>
<li>No doubt the trouble is with you.</li>
<li>The greatest ability is dependability.</li>
<li>You and God make a majority in your community.</li>
<li>The test of your character is what it takes to stop you.</li>
<li>You can borrow brains, but you cannot borrow character.</li>
<li>The acid test of our love for God is obedience to His Word.</li>
<li>Don't sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate.</li>
<li>It's never right to do wrong in order to get a chance to do right.</li>
<li>Beware of unreasonable people. Good men are always reasonable.</li>
<li>The door to the room of success swings on the hinges of opposition.</li>
<li>The measure of your responsibilities is a measure of your opportunities.</li>
<li>If you will give God your heart, He will comb all the kinks out of your head.</li>
<li>Beware of the man who kowtows to his superiors or who is rude to his inferiors.</li>
<li>Trust God as if it all depends upon Him, and work as if it all depends upon you.</li>
<li>When gratitude dies on the altar of a man's heart, that man is well-nigh hopeless.</li>
<li>Like it or not, you will have to live somewhere forever; so you better learn how to live.</li>
<li>It's no disgrace to fail; it is a disgrace to do less than your best to keep from failing.</li>
<li>The religions of the world say, "Do and live." The religion of the Bible says, "Live and do."</li>
<li>Mere education is not enough. You cannot put a man in the penitentiary for forgery until you first teach him to write.</li>
</ul>
