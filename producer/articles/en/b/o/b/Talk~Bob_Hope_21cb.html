<p>Sadly, Bob Hope, quite possibly the world's most famous entertainer, is dead at the age of 100. During his 100 years and 60 days of life, Hope did almost anything imaginable, starring in movies, television specials, award ceremonies and entertaining troops overseas. He even found time to write nearly a dozen books and play (according to one source) over 2000 games of golf. Hope will be remembered for his quick one-liners and irrepressible sense of fun. Most of all, his trips overseas during WWII, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, as well as Desert Storm have given our soldiers a look at what their fighting for: the American way of life. Bob Hope will be eulogized as an American Institution, and fittingly, he was awarded over 1000 awards for his character, humor and compassion for other people. Thanks for the memories Bob! <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELongevitymonger_3897.html" title="User:Longevitymonger">Longevitymonger</a></p>

<p>I removed the below paragraph from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hope's humour rarely took any risks and while he is famed for his performances for the US military, very few of the young men ever found him very funny. One exception to this took place in Korea. Hope came on stage before a hillside audience of about 15,000 GIs and opened with a question about Korea's famous odor: "What is that SMELL??" he asked. All 15,000 voices shouted out the answer: "SHIIITTT!" Hope paused and then said: "I know...but what do they DO to it?!.....That audience found him very funny.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The paragraph is very POV and is totally unsupported by the research I've done. I've found universally that his visits were always very appreciated and always lifted the GI's spirits. While the annecdote above may be true (don't know, I haven't encountered it before) it is not typical of Hope's humor. —<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> 13:30, 5 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can Bob Hope use 'Sir' in front of his name instead of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">KBE</a> after it? Although an American citizen, he was born in England.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before 1 January 1949, naturalisation as a U.S. citizen caused automatic loss of British nationality. He became American in 1920, and although he was under 21 at the time, he probably lost his British nationality on the basis of his father's loss of British nationality. Laws on citizenship were very different at the time. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 15:25, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, he couldn't, as JAJ says. But even if he could, he would have used the KBE as well. It's not an either/or situation. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a line between POV and well-documented facts that I try not to cross. Bringing up the issue of Bob Hope's personal reputation is difficult, in that those who admired Hope's immense talent - and I am one of them - often prefer not to know the off-stage side of him. Nearly 30 years after Bing Crosby's death, it is not taboo to acknowledge that Bing was, shall we say, not a nice person. In Hope's case, there are two ways of looking at it: 1) We need 28 more years to dare speak the truth, or 2) Let's grow up and face facts: like many comedic geniuses, he had a dark side. So, what shall it be? User:Professor Von Pie</p>

<p>I have no problem with adding information which doesn't correspond with the public image, but you have to do it in an NPOV manner.

<dd>In the common view, Hollywood stars having affairs is hardly indicative of a "dark side". Being a poor tipper is not exactly encyclopedic info, and someone who donates millions of dollars can't be called "stingy". If this info is included, it should be attributed to a source ("According to Joe Smith, Hope gave small tips and played around with starlets"). -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:41, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen, if I found and submitted a notarized photo, signed by God himself, of Bob Hope kicking Mother Teresa in the ass, it would make not an iota of difference to certain people-- nothing will be tolerated about Bob Hope except very nice itty-bitty sound bytes suitable for an 8th grade book report. Listen, kiddies, there's this thing called <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting.html" title="Acting">acting</a>. You see, it means a person pretends to be something to entertain others. Are you with me? But often, in reality, the pretend person is not exactly the same as the real person. For example, the real Jack Benny was not a cheapskate; the real Red Skelton was not stupid; the real John Wayne never served in the military. If you're having trouble, refer to the nearest adult... it could be a parent or teacher... and so it is not sacreligious nor unpatriotic to speak the truth about the real Mr. Bob Hope, who was substantially different than the performer. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Von_Pie_66f2.html" title="User:Professor Von Pie">User:Professor Von Pie</a></p>

<p>I didn't imply stupidity, but there is a childish, Santa Claus-like aura about this article and a few others that makes me wonder if there should be some sort of age/educational requirements for contributing and editing, although certainly that would be hard to enforce. I have provided ample evidence and played by the rules, but the article keeps getting vandalized, and I consider removing, altering, or defacing the truth vandalism. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to be a source of information, not fairytales or mere warm and fuzzy feelings. I'd never dream of inserting lies into an article and I don't see how anyone would, in good conscience, remove the truth. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Von_Pie_66f2.html" title="User:Professor Von Pie">User:Professor Von Pie</a></p>

<dd>I read the sources provided, but I see scant mention about stinginess. I do see a lot of other material which isn't in the articles, which makes it seems as if the editor was cherry picking (or perhaps, rotten-tomato picking). I didn't see anyone saying that this info was censored, or that it was "the result of the public's conflation of the beloved Hope media and the man himself." -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yep, the stinginess is in there, and re: cherry-picking, one could say the same of the whole article in general, that only patriotism and generosity have been selectively used; the Hopes' decades-long marriage and religious piety mentioned, but no mention of philandering. So, cherry-picking goes two ways. And the person saying that Hope's story is censored as the result of the public's conflation of the beloved Hope media persona and the man himself-- that is ME saying that, in an attempt to thwart vandalism. I am telling the person about to vandalize a paragraph her/she doesn't care for: I know what you're about to do, and I know why-- you cannot separate myth and imagery from reality, and it is not my fault I wrote the truth, it will be your fault for trampling upon it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Von_Pie_66f2.html" title="User:Professor Von Pie">User:Professor Von Pie</a></p>

<dd>Er, trust me, there's no conspiracy here to protect this celebrity's public memory.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>Philandering</i> is a PoV term, implying moral judgement and has no place in an encyclopedia (even as a verifiable quote it'd be dodgy).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So too with <i>stinginess</i>. Many people are careful with their money, it's a very unremarkable trait. On the other hand, Hope contributed vast amounts of his time to arguably philanthropic causes. If you want this word in the article, you must find a verifiable quote in a reliable secondary source.</li>

<li>Good faith (even if biased) content disputes aren't vandalism. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:08, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No, I never said there was a conspiracy. A conspiracy must involved two or more people. The redaction and censoring of the Hope article is done completely on an individual basis. No, I never put the word philandering in the article, only the discussion; but even if I had, according to dictionary.com, it means engaging in multiple, casual affairs. That suits Mr. Hope to a T. It is no more judgmental a word than adultery. Stinginess and mean-spiritedness? His niggardly attitude toward his writers and mistresses, refusal to pay $250 for the use of a song, his callous AIDS joke as thousands lay sick and dying... I referenced everything. By the way, there is a reason that the Hopes, Gateses, Jobs and Waltons give away huge sums to charity; it is called tax deductions. And no, "good faith" is YOUR POV, Wyss, I wouldn't even dare assume the good or bad faith of anyone but myself. And your compromise of watering down what I wrote... an effort to pacify those who don't want their world rocked by the facts of life... it won't even last throughout the day; it will be expurgated. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Von_Pie_66f2.html" title="User:Professor Von Pie">User:Professor Von Pie</a></p>

<li>I haven't touched this article so I don't know what you mean by "compromise of watering down what I wrote."</li>

<li>You seem to have misunderstood what people mean here when they use the term "good faith."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Give me some enough source material and I could make almost anyone look like a jerk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your contributions tend to read like those old "Jimmy Fiddler in Hollywood" columns I've run across. That's problematic in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, Wyss, I confused you with Will Beback, who toned me down so as not to cause wikis rushing to their medicine cabinets for smelling salts. Gosh, if the thought of Bob Hope being not a nice man makes people faint, they better not look up Marlon Brando's article-- it might suggest he was chubby.</p>
<p>I think that Hope was uproariously funny in his prime, but that's not the point. I know what good faith means, but it can mean 14 different things to 14 different people. Anything about Hope, Crosby, Sinatra, etc. is going to seem like Jimmy Fidler et al.; what source do you expect-- Field &amp; Stream? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Von_Pie_66f2.html" title="User:Professor Von Pie">User:Professor Von Pie</a></p>

<dd>I was talking about Jimmy Fiddler's writing style. Anyway, if a celebrity's life is encyclopedic enough for inclusion here, there is more than enough material relating to their professional career for an encyclopedic biography that isn't written with the same unsupportable rhetoric and filler as a gossip column, never mind Mr Fiddler's obsolete turns of phrase. I would add, the article can include references to personal relationships, so long as they're mentioned objectively and drawn from reliable secondary sources. I should add that your contributions now and then do seem objective and cleanly written, although you might want to consider integrating them more seamlessly into the text. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw this defense of criticisms, but no criticisms -</p>
<p>"Although Hope was frequently criticized, most fans agree the accusations have no real merit and were only caused by jealousy of his immense wealth or resentment of his Republican political beliefs."</p>
<p>If he was frequently criticized, what about; and saying that it was because of "jealousy of his immense wealth or resentment of his Republican political beliefs", seems POV, as is "most fans agree" - fans are probably not the most objective, by definition. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 05:57, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This read like a gushing handout from his agent, written by a 1950s gossip columnist or whatever.

<p>The article could use one or two quotes about the delivery style of his comedy and maybe a reference to the docking fortune he made from investing in California real estate (notably housing tracts and rental properties in the San Fernando valley) during the 1930s, 40s and50s. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Miles_Minter_355c.html" title="Mary Miles Minter">Mary Miles Minter</a> had invested in LA real estate before him and many celebrities later followed the example. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
