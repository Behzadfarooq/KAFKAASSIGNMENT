	    <p><b>Robert L. Howsam</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>) is a former executive in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> professional sport who, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_sports.html" title="1959 in sports">1959</a>, played a key role in establishing two leagues – the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a>, which succeeded and merged with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>, and baseball's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_League_cc75.html" title="Continental League">Continental League</a>, which never played a game but forced expansion of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> from 16 to 20 teams in 1961-62.</p>
<p>Along with his brother, Earl Howsam and father, Lee Howsam, he founded the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, one of the eight charter members of the AFL. (The Howsams and the seven other original owners called themselves "The Foolish Club" for daring to take on the established NFL). The Howsams also built <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bears_Stadium_568a.html" title="Bears Stadium">Bears Stadium</a>, which after renovation and expanded capacity became famous as the Broncos' noisy, raucous and perpetually sold-out home from 1960-2001, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile_High_Stadium_9a4f.html" title="Mile High Stadium">Mile High Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>The Broncos played in the AFL from 1960-69 and then joined the NFL with completion of the NFL/AFL merger in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_sports.html" title="1970 in sports">1970</a>. Apart from a 7-7 season in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_in_sports.html" title="1962 in sports">1962</a>, the team suffered from poor results on the field, and the Howsam family sold the Broncos in 1964 to Fred Gehrke. But it was developing a loyal fan base, and after its first <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> appearance in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_sports.html" title="1977 in sports">1977</a>, the Broncos have become one of the most successful operations in the NFL.</p>

<p>The Broncos may have struggled in the early 1960s, but Bob Howsam would prove himself to be a highly successful <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> executive. He led the family-owned <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Bears_2464.html" title="Denver Bears">Denver Bears</a> of the Class A <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_League_%28defunct_minor_league%29_7353.html" title="Western League (defunct minor league)">Western League</a> and Class AAA <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_%2820th_century%29_5fdf.html" title="American Association (20th century)">American Association</a> from 1947-62.</p>
<p>Thwarted in his attempts to bring major league baseball to Denver, Howsam was one of the founders of the Continental League, which in 1959 planned to become the "third major league" following the epidemic of franchise shifts during the 1950s. MLB magnates, nervous about the possible rescinding of baseball's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> exemption by the U.S. Congress after the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> abandoned New York, agreed to study (and ultimately support) the formation of the new loop.</p>
<p>While the Continental League never got off the drawing board - key cities New York (NL), Houston (NL) and Minneapolis-St. Paul (AL) were admitted to major league baseball in 1961-62 - it brought Howsam to the attention of league president <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_9adb.html" title="Branch Rickey">Branch Rickey</a>, the venerable, pioneering executive who had revolutionized baseball in his earlier career with the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Dodgers_1ffe.html" title="Brooklyn Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_baseball.html" title="1964 in baseball">1964</a>, Rickey (then 82) was semi-retired but still in baseball as a top advisor to St. Louis owner <a href="../../../a/u/g/August__Gussie__Busch_4bae.html" title="August &quot;Gussie&quot; Busch">August "Gussie" Busch</a>. In mid-August 1964, with the Cardinals seemingly about to finish well behind the first-place <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, Busch fired <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager.html" title="General manager">general manager</a> <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Devine_f861.html" title="Bing Devine">Bing Devine</a> and replaced him with Howsam - reputedly at Rickey's urging. But the team Howsam inherited ended up winning the NL pennant and the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_World_Series_d9e0.html" title="1964 World Series">1964 World Series</a> when the Phils collapsed in late September.</p>
<p>Howsam's two full years as Cardinals' general manager (1965-66) were not successful. The team fell back to .500 and many St. Louisans resented the fact that he had replaced a well-liked hometown figure, Devine, who had been wrongly fired. Howsam installed popular <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Schoendienst_9ca1.html" title="Red Schoendienst">Red Schoendienst</a> as manager and acquired future <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando_Cepeda_cdca.html" title="Orlando Cepeda">Orlando Cepeda</a> from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Giants_cfa9.html" title="San Francisco Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> in 1966. The Cardinals were poised to win back-to-back pennants in 1967-68, but when the opportunity arose to start fresh with the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> as their general manager in January <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_in_baseball.html" title="1967 in baseball">1967</a>, Howsam departed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Howsam_e0f0.html" title="Edit section: Engineering the 'Big Red Machine'">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Engineering the 'Big Red Machine'</span></h2>
<p>In Cincinnati, Howsam flourished. During his 11 years (1967-77) as general manager, he was one of the key figures (along with his predecessor, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_DeWitt_ea94.html" title="Bill DeWitt">Bill DeWitt</a>, and his manager, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparky_Anderson_a394.html" title="Sparky Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a>) behind "The Big Red Machine," which captured NL titles in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_baseball.html" title="1970 in baseball">1970</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a> and world championships in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_baseball.html" title="1975 in baseball">1975</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_baseball.html" title="1976 in baseball">1976</a>.</p>
<p>Although many of the Reds - <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Bench_a2cb.html" title="Johnny Bench">Johnny Bench</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Perez_1312.html" title="Tony Perez">Tony Perez</a> - were already in place (or in the organization) in 1966, Howsam boldly promoted young <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitchers.html" title="Pitchers">pitchers</a> such as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Nolan_%28baseball_player%29_5a70.html" title="Gary Nolan (baseball player)">Gary Nolan</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Gullett_26b5.html" title="Don Gullett">Don Gullett</a> and Wayne Simpson to the major leagues. He ensured that the fruitful Cincinnati farm system continued to churn out young position players, such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Concepci%C3%B3n_90b7.html" title="Dave Concepción">Dave Concepción</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Griffey_Sr._04b0.html" title="Ken Griffey Sr.">Ken Griffey</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in two masterful 1971 trades, he acquired <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_baseman.html" title="Second baseman">second baseman</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Morgan_fe7f.html" title="Joe Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> from the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a> and <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outfielder.html" title="Outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Foster_%28baseball_player%29_fc88.html" title="George Foster (baseball player)">George Foster</a> from the Giants. In Cincinnati, Morgan would win the NL <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Valuable_Player_9a8e.html" title="Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a> award in 1975-76 and earn credentials as a member of the Hall of Fame. Foster would hit 52 <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_runs.html" title="Home runs">home runs</a> for the Reds in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_baseball.html" title="1977 in baseball">1977</a> - the only player to crack the half-century HR mark in the 1970s or 1980s. The '76 Cincinnati club, which won 102 regular season games, then swept both the Phillies in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_baseball.html" title="1976 in baseball">1976</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Championship_Series_cfa4.html" title="National League Championship Series">National League Championship Series</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_World_Series_630f.html" title="1976 World Series">1976 World Series</a>, is usually considered one of the strongest in baseball history.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Howsam_e0f0.html" title="Edit section: The Sun Sets on a Dynasty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Sun Sets on a Dynasty</span></h2>
<p>Approaching his 60th birthday at the close of the 1977 season, Howsam (who had added the title of president of the Reds in 1973) turned over his general manager responsibilities to a longtime assistant, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Wagner_%28baseball%29_c38f.html" title="Dick Wagner (baseball)">Dick Wagner</a>. But the Reds' success ended when Howsam stepped aside. With the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agent.html" title="Free agent">free agent</a> era dawning, and with the Reds' stubborn refusal to play the big-money game, "The Big Red Machine" began to lose key players. Howsam had already traded Perez to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Expos_1ed2.html" title="Montreal Expos">Montreal Expos</a> in the months following the 1976 title. Gullett, Rose and Morgan were allowed to leave via free agency. Nolan developed arm problems. Anderson was fired after the Reds finished second in the NL West in both 1977 and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_baseball.html" title="1978 in baseball">1978</a>.</p>
<p>Howsam resigned as president in 1978, and Wagner was blamed by many for the team's decline - although Howsam, one of the most conservative voices in the game at that point, surely helped set fiscal policy for the club. Yet Howsam's contributions to the Reds' brilliant successes of 1970-76 could not be overlooked - he even briefly returned to the club presidency in 1983-84, after Wagner's firing - and Howsam was elected to the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_Hall_of_Fame_539a.html" title="Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame">Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame</a> in 2004.</p>
