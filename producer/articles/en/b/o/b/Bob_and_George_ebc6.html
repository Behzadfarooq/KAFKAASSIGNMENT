<p><i><b>Bob and George</b></i> is a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_comic.html" title="Sprite comic">sprite-based</a> <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> which parodies the fictional universe of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man</a>. It is written by David Anez, a physics instructor who lives in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwestern_United_States_9447.html" title="Midwestern United States">Midwest</a>. <a href="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/AboutMe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/AboutMe.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The comic first appeared on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> and has been updated daily with very few missed comics. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of September 2006</a> there have only been 17 days without a comic.</p>
<p>Initially conceived as a hand-drawn comic, <i>Bob and George</i> became a sprite comic first as <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filler.html" title="Filler">filler</a>, and then permanently after two failed attempts at the hand-drawn format.</p>
<p>Most <i>Bob and George</i> strips are still images. The initial strips were mostly done in <a href="../../../g/i/f/GIF_95a6.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> format (occasionally using <a href="../../../j/p/e/JPEG_907e.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> for more graphic-intensive comics) before converting to <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2004.html" title="May 2004">May 2004</a>. In addition, occasional comics are <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animated</a> using either animated GIFs or <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_Flash_1a63.html" title="Macromedia Flash">Macromedia Flash</a>. Some of the Flash comics have the characters speaking, voiced by Anez and others (often forum members). Animated comics are generally used for the annual week-long <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anniversary.html" title="Anniversary">anniversary</a> parties (usually culminating in a brief flash comic that recaps the events of the past year in a matter of seconds), for especially climactic scenes, and for the Cataclysm videos.</p>
<p>The comic's plot is mostly made up of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_arc.html" title="Story arc">story arcs</a> of varying lengths. Amongst past story arcs there have been retellings of various Mega Man games which often play out quite differently than the originals, as well as battles against powerful foes. In addition, many of the story arcs involve either <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">dimensional</a> travel.</p>

An early hand-drawn comic from <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <a href="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Archive/Jun00.php?date=7&amp;c=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Archive/Jun00.php?date=7&amp;c=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></div>

<p>Bob and George was originally planned to be a hand-drawn webcomic about the college adventures of two brothers named Bob and George. Slated to start on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, the plan fell through when Anez didn't have a scanner with which to <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_scanning.html" title="Image scanning">scan</a> his drawings. He instead released a sequence of filler comics using Mega Man sprites, which he intended to be a temporary measure until he gained access to a scanner, at which point he would implement his initial plan involving the hand drawn comics. He eventually purchased a scanner, and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a> he released the hand-drawn comic.</p>
<p>Anez has stated that he hated the hand-drawn comic,<a href="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/Begin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/Begin.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and returned to making the sprite comic with Mega Man characters on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>. The sprite comic continued for several months, until Anez took time off from the comic on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a> to practice drawing. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, he restarted the hand-drawn comic. Once again, production of the hand-drawn comic didn't last long, and on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a> he went back to producing the sprite-based comic, which is still being produced. However, in the storyline "All Good Things", which features the title character George being warped between time periods, the hand-drawn format is used to represent George's home dimension, though this time drawn by Dave's wife, Liss. The stated reason for this is that he realized that he still couldn't draw, and wasn't going to get any better.<a href="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/Begin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/Other/Begin.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>However, this meant that the comic strip was titled "Bob and George", but didn't contain any characters named "Bob" or "George". This was fixed shortly, when sprite versions of the two characters were introduced into the comic. Bob was depicted as a gray Protoman <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palette_swap.html" title="Palette swap">recolor</a> while George was a Mega Man recolor with blond hair and no helmet.</p>
<p>David plans to end the comic by April 1, 2007, which is the end of the seventh year of the comic's run.</p>

<p>Bob and George has an active fan community. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of August 2006</a>, the site's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">forums</a> have over 9,750 registered users and over 475,000 articles posted. In many ways, the forums have grown to be almost completely disconnected from the main comic, as the community has flourished on its own. In an informal survey conducted of the Bob and George forum members, 82% of survey respondents claimed to read Bob and George on a regular basis, with the remaining 18% either reading it occasionally or not at all. <a href="http://forums.bobandgeorge.com/viewtopic.php?t=12878" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.bobandgeorge.com/viewtopic.php?t=12878" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the main comic, the Bob and George site hosts a number of comics created by fans of the comic. These comics, which were selected by Anez for inclusion on the site, are known as "fancomics". Fancomics that have been determined by Dave to be of sufficient proven substance are referred to as "subcomics", and are linked to in their own area in the site. Most of the fancomics are sprite based.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>The Karnak Hates Everything Show</i> by <i>Karnak</i>. The story of Karnak, a demon lord and leader of his own alternate Hell, Karnakville. This story features a mostly original realm and cast of characters, as opposed to the traditional basis on Mega Man or another video game.</li>
<li><i>Legacy of Terra: The Vampire Wars</i> by <i>Karnak</i>. A serious fantasy comic occurring in the fantasy world of Terra. The comic has a large and ever-expanding cast of characters, with various backgrounds and roles.</li>
<li><i>Metroid: Third Derivative</i> by <i>Reynard</i>. Occurring after the events of <a href="../../../e/c/h/Metroid_Prime_2%7E_Echoes_890b.html" title="Metroid Prime 2: Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, the comic involves the (mis)adventures of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samus.html" title="Samus">Samus</a>, a degenerate caste Space Pirate, and a sentient <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid_%28species%29.html" title="Metroid (species)">Metroid</a>.

<li><i>Misadventures</i> by <i>Plague</i>. This comic takes place in the time period of Mega Man X, where the Maverick Hunters are the only defense against Sigma's forces. The comic features Plague Roamer, the leader of the worst Hunter Team in history. The character is a psychotic robot and the clandestine son of Dr. Wily, who fights evil for all the wrong reasons. This comic is serious at times, dealing with Plague Roamer's battle against his own dark nature, though he generally doesn't try very hard or often.</li>
<li><i>MS Paint Masterpieces</i> by <i>DisgruntledFerret</i>: Another Mega Man-based comic, more closely related to the original Mega Man story than <i>Bob and George</i> is. The comic features new, author-created sprites for already extant characters and contains some plot elements and characters unique to the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_line_db0f.html" title="Game Boy line">Game Boy</a> line of Mega Man games.</li>
<li><i>Oddball Fancomics</i> by <i>Rick O'Shay</i>/<i>RickX</i>. A longtime subcomic that takes place in a Mega Man world with Rick O'Shay as its supreme author/all-around-god. Hasn't updated in over a year.</li>
<li><i>Universal Voyage</i> by <i>Nameless Wonder</i> (also known as <i>NW</i>): The story of the Nameless Wonder, a genetic clone. This story features an original realm and cast of characters, as opposed to the traditional basis on Mega Man or another video game.</li>

<p>Subcomics authored by Dave Anez are also listed in the same category as the "old subcomics". These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Cataclysm</i>: A series of animations which chronicles the events of the Cataclysm, the event in the comic which caused the divide between the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">original Mega Man series</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_X_%28series%29_675d.html" title="Mega Man X (series)">Mega Man X</a> series. The existing movies are currently being remade, after which Anez plans to finish the series.</li>
<li><i>Helmeted Author Quips</i>: This comic began as filler on the website's main page. This featured the Helmeted Author, who would generally be saying something corrupt or mean. This subcomic also encompasses the various other art, animations, and parodies displayed in the same area of the main page. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of September</a>, these comics cannot be navigated to via the website due to a server glitch; however, this problem has been rectified, and the quips are running smoothly.</li>

<p>As with the subcomics, there have been many former fancomics. Although some have become subcomics in place of a previous subcomic that ended or left the site, a few fancomics simply ceased to be, usually because the author of the comic stopped producing new comics.

<li><b><a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28character%29_3a69.html" title="Mega Man (character)">Mega Man</a></b> - Debatably the main star of the comic, he is a robot created by <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Light_%28Mega_Man%29_4f9d.html" title="Doctor Light (Mega Man)">Dr. Light</a>. His primary mission is to destroy evil robots and stop <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Wily_b9bc.html" title="Dr. Wily">Dr. Wily</a>; his secondary mission is to be an idiot.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto_Man_2b6b.html" title="Proto Man">Proto Man</a></b> - Created by Dr. Light, he is the older robotic brother of Mega Man. He is considered a strategic fighter and one of the more mature characters in the comic, though he's often seen torturing Mega Man</li>
<li><b>The Author</b> - The (nearly) all-powerful being who made the comic. The Author often appears to see how things are going, but tries not to get directly involved in the story. He appears as a blue/purple <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palette_swap.html" title="Palette swap">palette swap</a> of Mega Man without his helmet. See <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>.</li>
<li><b>Bob</b> - The younger, yet more mature, brother of George, he is technically evil personified. His <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter-ego.html" title="Alter-ego">alter-ego</a> is Napalm, a super-powered being with control over the element of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>. He is very adept at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_programming.html" title="Computer programming">programming</a>, although the story reveals that this is only true when he has a template of sorts to start from, essentially, as he puts it, reprogramming code for optimizing. He is a grey palette swap of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto_Man_2b6b.html" title="Proto Man">Proto Man</a>, with red hair underneath his helmet. Dave Anez has stated that Bob is a prime example of a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Sue_e6e3.html" title="Mary Sue">Mary Sue</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. A running gag in the series is that his alternate self from another dimension is gay, although in a non-stereotypical fashion.</li>
<li><b>George</b> - The quote-unquote "real" star of the series, he is essentially the opposite of his younger brother, Bob. At least half of the story arcs don't revolve around him though, as they will tend to revolve around the various Mega Man games or one of the characters, usually Bob, traveling through time or dimensions. His alter-ego is Blitz, a super hero with control over the element of lightning. He greatly values <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_cream.html" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a>. George is a light blue and grey palette swap of helmet-less Mega Man with blonde hair. He is also effected by an unwritten rule that prevents him from dying due to his name being in the title.</li>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28Mega_Man%29_ef8b.html" title="Bass (Mega Man)">Bass</a></b> - Even less intelligent than Mega Man, Bass is a robot created by Dr. Wily and designed to be similar to Mega Man.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../r/o/l/Roll_%28Mega_Man%29_896d.html" title="Roll (Mega Man)">Roll</a></b> - A robot created by Dr. Light. Initially created as Dr. Light's former housekeeper, she has since demonstrated an enjoyment of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat.html" title="Combat">combat</a>.</li>
<li><b>Nate</b> - A <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bio-Devil_346a.html" title="Bio-Devil">yellow demon</a> who once attacked several cast members, Dr. Light turned him into a humanoid-looking Yellow Demon prototype designated N4-T3. This process seems to have rendered him mute, as he now communicates nonverbally with signs, gestures, and the like. Has the ability to merge with other robots. Referred to as Nate, as this is what N4-T3 translates to from <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a>. Wears large eyeglasses which contain a control jewel.</li>
<li><b>Chadling</b> - A purple demon with <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a>-like claws from the same dimension as Mynd. He was initially Mynd's minion. When not in demon form, he looks like a purple version of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_7_47fc.html" title="Mega Man 7">Mega Man 7</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Master_c55f.html" title="Robot Master">Robot Master</a> Slash Man. He enjoys ice cream as much as George. His serial number is C1-14D, model L1N6. He is referred to as Chadling since that is what "C1-14D L1N6" translates to from leet.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_X_%28character%29_a9b1.html" title="Mega Man X (character)">X</a></b> - Dr. Light's most advanced robotic creation, X is a super-advanced robot from 100 years in the future who can think for himself. The star of the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_X_%28series%29_675d.html" title="Mega Man X (series)">Mega Man X</a> games.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_%28Mega_Man%29_bebe.html" title="Zero (Mega Man)">Zero</a></b> - X's friend, he is a robot created by Dr. Wily. Went on a rampage that caused the Cataclysm. Was put into a 100-year sleep, and became good sometime after that.</li>
<li><b>Prometheus</b> - Essentially Protoman in the post-cataclysm world, Prometheus is his own character. He tends to reminisce on the past and how much he misses it, and tends to remind X and the others of how he managed to survive the cataclysm. After everything he's been through, he prefers the freakyness from when the author was around to the dark and more serious nature of the X world.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Light_%28Mega_Man%29_4f9d.html" title="Doctor Light (Mega Man)">Dr. Light</a></b> - An <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> scientist who created various members of the robotic cast, including Mega Man, Mega Man X, Proto Man, and Roll.</li>
<li><b>Ran Cossack</b> - A <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communist</a> robot created by Kalinka, the daughter of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Cossack_f803.html" title="Doctor Cossack">Dr. Cossack</a>, who was thought to be the villain of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_4_720c.html" title="Mega Man 4">Mega Man 4</a>, but was really being blackmailed by Dr. Wily. Ran is very fragile, and can be destroyed with as little as a poke of a finger. However, upon being destroyed a duplicate body with a copy of his memory is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transporter_%28Star_Trek%29_ca74.html" title="Transporter (Star Trek)">beamed</a> to his previous location. His weapon is the Cossack Buster, an incredibly powerful blaster with similarly powerful recoil. He is a well known <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_character.html" title="Fan character">fan character</a> in the Bob and George community. In fact, the character is so well known that he is often mistaken for a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> Mega Man character.</li>
<li><b>Mike</b> - From the same dimension as Mynd. Mynd's former minion, Mike is a cybernetic ninja. He is a red/dark grey palette swap of Mega Man with Proto Man's shield. Called "Ninja Ned" by Roll, much to his dismay.</li>
<li><b>Alternate Mega Man and Bass</b> - Alternate versions of Mega Man and Bass from an <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">alternate dimension</a>. The two are extremely intelligent and spend much of their time debating scientific issues.</li>
<li><b>The Shadowy Author</b> - The author of the Rockman Universe, the Shadowy Author appears to be neither friend nor foe to the cast. He has interfered in the events of the primary universe on several occasions, though his intentions in doing so are unknown. He also has the same eye color as the Helmeted Author</li>
<li><b>Alternate Bob</b> - A version of Bob from an alternate dimension, he is <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effeminacy.html" title="Effeminacy">effeminate</a>, witty, and openly <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a>. The only difference in appearance between him and the primary universe's Bob is that Alternate Bob's scarf is purple.</li>
<li><b>Alternate George</b> - A version of George from an alternate dimension, he is a psychotic killer with a sarcastic humor. He managed to kill Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, and Roll of the alternate dimension, but was unable to kill his universe's Mega Man, Bass, Bob, Protoman or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mega_Man_characters_228d.html#Support_robots" title="List of Mega Man characters">Beat</a>. When he is first introduced, he is shown attempting to kill Beat, but this results in becoming blind due to Beat pecking his eyes out.</li>
<li><b>Vic</b> - An evil program designed by Bob in order to ensure that Mega Man turns evil every once in a while. The root control of Megaman, besides Megaman himself. Looks exactly like Bob, and sells "pure, concentrated, unending evil" at a stand inside Megaman's head. Megaman's eyes are red when vic is operating Megaman during the 16-bit comics</li>
<li><b>Ted</b> - A new addition to the roster, Ted is a fellow Super-Hero from Georges past, which the Author distinctly keeps drawn by hand instead of using sprites. We mostly see him in the time jumping incident where George is flung between the past, present, and future. He is a dark skinned man wearing a white and Carolina blue uniform with a blue visor. His elemental power is cryogenic ice blast.</li>
<li><b>Bate</b> - Not a true new character, but a merger of Bass and Nate created during "The Attack of Megaman" story arc where Megaman became evil, designated B4-T3. He is basically a recolored 16-bit <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guts_Man_7abb.html" title="Guts Man">Guts Man</a> sprite with Bass' head on it. Referred to as Bate, since this is what B4-T3 translates to from <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a>. His name became an immediate pun when Bate demanded that Evil Megaman refer to him as "Master" before he killed him. Evil Megaman promptly replied with the question "Master Bate?" making the gag obvious.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>The Mega Man universe</b> - The comic's main setting is in a highly-<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodied</a> version of the Mega Man universe. Notable locations include:
<ul>
<li><i>Dr. Light's lab</i> - The lab of Dr. Light, and home of most of the comic's heroes. The lab is complete with an area for the creation of new robots, as well as a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodeck.html" title="Holodeck">holographic</a> training simulator in which members of the cast hone their fighting skills.</li>
<li><i>Dr. Wily's fortress</i> - The fortress was home to both Dr. Wily and Bass before being destroyed later in the comic. Dr. Wily has had a different fortress in each of the Mega Man games which inevitably end up being destroyed by the end of the game.</li>
<li><i>Dr. Cossack's castle</i> - Located in Russia, the castle is home to Dr. Cossack, his daughter Kalinka, and Ran.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>The Alternate Mega Man universe</b> - A <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel dimension</a>, home to alternate versions of the cast who have dramatically different personalities than those of the standard universe. Examples include extremely intelligent versions of Mega Man and Bass, a homosexual Bob, and a homicidally violent George.</li>
<li><b>Mynd's universe</b> - Another universe, this is the home dimension of Mynd, and his henchmen Mike and Chadling.</li>
<li><b>The Rockman Universe</b> - A universe controlled by the Shadowy Author, this universe is based on the universe of the Japanese <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Rockman</a> games. A more serious universe in which Rock is competent, Roll is subservient, and Forte and Dr. Wily are actually evil. This universe has recently suffered its Cataclysm due to actions of future versions of the Mega Man and Bass from the Alternate Mega Man Universe.</li>
<li><b>The White Space</b> - An all <a href="../../../w/h/i/White.html" title="White">white</a> dimension which is revealed to be a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demiplane.html" title="Demiplane">demiplane</a> which interacts with all comic universes. Helmut was banished to here when trying to destroy the comic.</li>
<li><b>Megaman's Mind</b> - This is where Vic and Megaman's actual Mind live. There is nothing but a TV with a giant keyboard, and a lemonade stand, which sells glasses of pure concentrated unending evil. There appears to be another room in a picture with the stand, but that might be where the TV is. It is also apparently possible to access other parts of Mega Man's body from here, such as his Mega-Buster as seen in the 6th Mega Man Game storyline.</li>

<li><b>Cataclysm</b> - The event in the Bob and George future where Zero kills most of the Mega Man characters.</li>
<li><b>Helmeted Author Quips</b> - Helmeted Author Quips are random pictures or animations that depict the Helmeted Author doing something generally unrelated to the Bob and George story. Also refers to or pictures/animations that are displayed below the comic that have nothing to do with the Helmeted Author. On Friday, <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">October 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, it was revealed that Helmeted Author has probably escaped this area.</li>
<li><b>Quirky Personalities</b> - The Robot Masters within the Bob and George universe are plagued with personalities that render them extremely stereotypical in relation to their name.</li>
<li><b>Plot Hole</b> - The end result of a logical paradox, such as a character being in two places at the exact same time. Believed to cause a catastrophic event of universal reach that would completely obliterate all universes that ever have or ever will exist.

Bob wakes up in the standard universe's past just prior to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_5_a222.html" title="Mega Man 5">Mega Man V</a>, and teams up with Dr. Wily to take over the world. The Present Alternates and the Future Alternates arrive in this time period, and team up with Mega Man and Ran to defeat Bob, which they successfully accomplish. Bob gets stuck in a subspace rift.</p>

<p>Dr. Light activates X, who <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimilation_%28Star_Trek%29_1270.html" title="Assimilation (Star Trek)">assimilates</a> most of the cast, as well as most of the world. George defeats X, freeing those who were assimilated.</p>
<p>Dr. Wily pulls Bob out of the subspace rift and coerces Bob to program Zero for him. Dr. Wily then sends Bob back in time, where he appears just prior to the events of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_6_68ab.html" title="Mega Man 6">Mega Man VI</a>. George travels back in time to get his brother. The Mega Man VI robot tournament begins.</p>

<p>The tournament continues, with Bob and George manipulating events behind the scenes so that the timeline remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Shortly after the first round of the First Annual Robot Tournament ended, a "Temporal Burp" appeared within the comic, which seems to have been caused by Bob and George's actions in the Mega Man 6 storyline. The present strips are currently in a distortion wave due to this.</p>
<p>Bob steals George's time-suit off of George and programs the evil personality Vic into Mega Man, setting Mega Man up to cause havoc in the tournament. George zaps Bob, causing the time-suit to malfunction and send Bob through time. The evil Mega Man starts to hunt the other robots. Meanwhile, the Author continues to block the distortion wave with difficulty.</p>
<p>Dr. Wily, still disguised as Mr. X, sends the remaining tournament robots after Mega Man as a stalling tactic, so he can retreat to his fortress. Mega Man manages to defeat each robot sent after him. Mega Man's real programming apparently is accidentally destroyed, leaving Vic the only personality in Mega Man. Meanwhile, Dr. Wily and the surviving robots made it to his fortress. Dr. Wily activates Gamma in an attempt to defeat Mega Man. who goes out of control and destroys Wily's fortress and defeats Mega Man. However, just as Wily is about to deliver the coup de grace on Mega Man, Ball Man strikes him like a bowling ball and leaves him stunned and disoriented. Dr. Light then arrives and asks what happened, being oblivious to Mega Man's rampage, to which Mega Man claims that everything was Wily's doing , thus resulting in Wily's incarceration and the end the 6th Mega Man game.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the comic goes back to the presumable present, with George coming through the doors and complaining about being thrown through time from the past to the present to the future. After a few comics, he is sent to the future and talks with Prometheus (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto_Man_2b6b.html" title="Proto Man">Proto Man</a> in disguise), and it is revealed that he is 137 years old and that he is a demigod. He then is sent to the hand-drawn universe, where he zaps <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrooge_McDuck_d8cd.html" title="Scrooge McDuck">Scrooge McDuck</a> and a new character, Ted, is introduced. It becomes readily apparent that Shador is behind George's time travel, in what Dave has said is mostly a parody of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> episode <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Good_Things_17a8.html" title="All Good Things">All Good Things</a></p>
<p>Next, George wakes up to find himself in a drawn world much like what Dave imagined when he intended the strip to originally be hand-drawn, where Bob is his friend and he's a college kid. When he inquired where Mega Man and everyone was, his so-called friends were confused. After attempting to call the Author and nothing happened, he was shut up for Breaking the Fourth Wall.</p>

<ul>
<li>Due to what many users believe is a temporal flux in the comic, the first comics up to April 29, 2000 were being slowly scrambled and then dissipating. The Author was on the strip for the 29th, holding the burp off. It was still being debated on what's causing the burp. But on August 29, 2006, every comic up until October 18, 2000 was wiped. They were also made inaccessible. These comics have since been restored, but only likely due to an error in the archival code, which has misplaced parts of the layout, made various comics disappear, and disabled commentary from the first two years.</li>
<li>On November 4, 2006, at the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youmacon.html" title="Youmacon">Youmacon</a> convention, and in the blurb beneath the comic <a href="http://bobandgeorge.com/News.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bobandgeorge.com/News.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, Anez confirmed that "the comic is coming to an end", probably within the following 6 months.</li>
