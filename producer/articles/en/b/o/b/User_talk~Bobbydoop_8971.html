<p>You are inserting bizarre edits all over the place that are confounding me and other users. Gagnon bus services has been alerted about your attacks stating the company lacked "internal stability", and I would suggest that you stop editing any article connected to them. I created a section on transportation in the article, and I don't think it is necessary to insert more POV information dealing with specific bus lines. The fact the school is close to another school might be interesting to a bus driver but not to Wikipedia readers in the introduction. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 18:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I've been a Wikipedian for a fair amount of time now, and we have a certain culture here. It's OK to include information critical of a subject, but it needs to be included in a fair and normal manner. Your edits on St. John's, Stuyvesant, and Alpha Phi Alpha have antagonized the editors on those pages. So I'm not the only person upset with you. I've also seen some edits on Dominican Republic and St. John's that were dangerous vandalism, pure and simple. I would recommend that you go back and improve your own article about Bergtraum and leave the others alone for a bit. If you continue to make the edits you are making, sooner or later you will probably be banned in all honesty. I'm glad you are trying to reach out finally.

<p>I haven't touched Bergtrum since creating it. Alpha Phi Alpha i have good amount of proof. Allow me a section on St. John's and Stuyvesant where I can place VERIFIED information. If it's not verified, you can remove it. Fair enough? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 04:22, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine, but you need to do it in a calm and NORMAL way. And present both sides -- that's the point of Wikipedia. Your tone of writing is way too aggressive. I hope the more vandalism style edits were only because of your frustration from being reverted. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 04:26, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Create a section on St. John's near the middle labeled controversy at the college. At Stuyvesant they are pretty much agreeing to my postings. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 04:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Individuals were going back and forth. We have finally been able to make a compromise as long as tfine80 agrees.

<dd>Indeed, many of your edits have been downright absurd, and you've deliberately used inaccurate edit summaries. You received repeated warnings (and were informed of the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">three-revert rule</a>), and you continually removed these messages from this page.

All of my edits have been verified. Individuals as it seemed were vandalizing my page, while deleting my submissions or reverting them. Attempts were made to stop it. Now after an exhausting period we agree that we must discuss this. I am requesting to be able to use the Stuyvesant talk section to help finish up the discussion there.. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> 04:49, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't possible for me to permit you to edit that specific page without unblocking you. If you promise that during the next seven days, you won't edit any of the disputed articles without consensus, I shall do so. If, however, you breach this agreement (or exhibit similar behavior on a different article), I <i><b>will</b></i> reinstate the block.

<p>I agree. I request that pages that I've edited on be protected, and that a block on deletes on my revisions be put in place.

<dd>I've lifted your block. I will not protecting any of these articles at this time, and I expect you to uphold your end of the agreement (regardless of how others edit the pages).
