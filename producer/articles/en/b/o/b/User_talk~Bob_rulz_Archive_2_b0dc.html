<p>I have restored the images again -- as I am discussing the native peoples of Utah, I am discussing the environment in which they lived and worked. I am selecting existing images and changing the captions to reflect their relevance. For example -- the wetlands of Northern Utah are a prime example of the type of environment that the Desert Archaic people chose to live in. Since we can't have pictures of those people -- their homelands seem like the next best bet. So please be patient. In time, we will weed out the ones that are truly not relevant. Thank you. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 06:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you think you can find some pictures of itmes related to these prehistoric people, I would love to have them. Images of artifacts are usually copyrighted, unless they are held on government web sites. And many of the early people and the Shoshoneans left less photogenic material remains. I think there are probably too many pics in this section (and a purge will happen) but a wetland pic is quite important as the average reader doesn't think about wetlands in Utah and their importance to a lithic culture. Native people contacted by Europeans are also poorly represented in photographs, as the process itself changed their cultural presentation.</dd>
<dd>But -- regarding the overall article, I was appalled last month to find there was absolutely no <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Utah_df0b.html" title="History of Utah">History of Utah</a> article. So, I am cutting and pasting one together as best I can. I hope there will be a whole series of articles, by time period, eventually. Hopefully, others like you will notice and perhaps contribute. If you don't like to write, but would like to help -- how about giving your opinion on the talk page about an appropriate outline? or look for references or check facts? Thanks for your interest. We Utahns need to stick together. Best wishes. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 07:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I'm a historian and archaeologist -- no doubt about it. But I do a lot of biographical information as well, and I've lived in northern Utah for a long time. My Wiki time goes up and down -- I have varying family and work responsibilities. I also find that I work in a particular area furiously and then get distracted for awhile. Sometimes that's a good thing, because my work looks much better when I edit mercilessly after letting it cool for a while.</dd>
<dd>Geography of Utah would be a challenge. Such a wide variety of zones, geology and ecosystems. I don't have any books on my shelves specifically on Geography, but I know some of my history books have at least a chapter. I've spent time in northern Utah and extreme southeastern Utah, and did some grad work on land use and settlement patterns in the Uintah Basin, so I could probably help most in those areas. Create the article, and I'm sure I'll watch it and dabble if nothing else.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Actually, Census figures are estimates. It's true that the census was blocked from using statistical sampling for reapportionment data, but still, you don't actually think the census bureau tracks down every single person in America, do you? The 2000 census response rate was about 67% - the highest it's been in a while. You can find out more detailes about census methodology at their website.</p>
<p>I didn't revert your edited because it's a minor point and because "reports" is accurate just as "estimates" is. but just sending you this as an FYI.</p>
<p>Cheers, Chicken Soda</p>

<p>See the discussion on the talk page. Indefinitely postponed is just a euphemism for cancelled. If it's not in development, it can't be finished.

<dd>They <i>could</i> start it back up and finish it, but the same is true of most cancelled games. The point is there are no current verifiable plans to do so. You can't base articles on what could happen.

<p>FYI, both sets of numbers are estimates. The numbers I was using were projections made from the 2000 data found at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Utah_%28by_population%29_a239.html" title="List of cities in Utah (by population)">List of cities in Utah (by population)</a>.

I understand *now* that you were, in fact, correct, but I was getting my data from another wikipedia page with "less useful" data. That page needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing, and have fun in Wikipedia! <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 07:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, the data in the first column of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Utah_%28by_population%29_a239.html" title="List of cities in Utah (by population)">List of cities in Utah (by population)</a> are projections for the 2005 population of Utah. The data on that page comes from this report <a href="http://www.governor.utah.gov/dea/05BaselineCityProj.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.governor.utah.gov/dea/05BaselineCityProj.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This report uses the 2000 census data as a base, and projects forward to 2050.</dd>
<dd>Also as I understand it, the numbers you were quoting for West Valley City and Provo (the ones that puts Provo a little higher than WVC) come from the census 2005 estimates, which are *not* projections. Those numbers come from <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US49&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT-T1-R&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2005_EST&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2005_EST_GCTT1R_ST9S&amp;-format=ST-9S&amp;-_sse=on" class="external autonumber" title="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US49&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT-T1-R&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2005_EST&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2005_EST_GCTT1R_ST9S&amp;-format=ST-9S&amp;-_sse=on" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So I think that the Utah cities list needs to be changed to reflect the more up-to-date data.</dd>
<dd>No 1RR isn't a rule, but merely a guideleine of Wikiquette.

<p>I see that the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Utah_snowstorm_c5d1.html" title="2003 Utah snowstorm">2003 Utah snowstorm</a> article was created. Hooray (again)! Remember those two supercells we had in Salt Lake and Provo (if you live in one those areas)? Should there be an article about that, because I heard that Provo had around $13 million in damage, and the Salt Lake East Bench was hit pretty hard, too. I dunno, there's lots of supercells aroud the country, and making articles for each one seems pretty stupid, but it's just that we don't see supercells that often.

<p>I believe I added references at the bottom of the article siting all my sources. There were a couple of history books and such. In fact, I think I started the references section. I'll have to ask Mike (Cool Hand Luke) as I know him in RL. Does that help?</p>

<p>Hi there. I remember in high school and college that I used to make forecasts about hurricane seasons, which storms would hit land, how far we'd get down the list, etcetera, etcetera based on pure speculation, and nothing more. The difference between then and now is that at that point, only a handful of people knew I had made such a prediction on the planet and we had it scribbed on a page of some obscure notebook in our own posession that few others were likely to see. Having this type of speculation on the discussion page is much more visible because anyone on the internet can read it, therefore it is "public" for consumption by anyone with an internet connection. Now that Gary Padgett has highlighted wikipedia in his widely-dispersed monthly tropical cyclone summaries, don't be surprised if others use a similar argument or say something similar. If you want to e-mail about this topic, I can send you my e-mail and we can correspond about how these kinds of forecast have been perceived in the past by TPC/NHC (as long as my e-mail address from your personal page is deleted soon afterwards.) It is becoming increasingly likely that someone at NHC is going to view that discussion page, if it hasn't happenned already.</p>
<p>Don't consider this the "National Weather Service" line on the topic just because I'm part of it, and this is not a personal attack of any sort. I just am under the impression that wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a bulletin board, and that the discussion pages are merely about fine points of detail concerning the article itself, not about making predictions per se. In a religious sense, like the Jewish Tanach, not France's Nostradamus. If my impression is wrong, show me the wikipedia guidleline that spells out predictions connected to its articles, and I'll shut up. There are other internet/weather discussion boards where predictions can be made and shared, without attaching it to an online encyclopedia. I'd hate to squelch your enthusiasm for meteorology...I still have it myself, even at 33 and after 13 years in the NWS. =) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThegreatdr_61ad.html" title="User:Thegreatdr">Thegreatdr</a> 17:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I responded that he was correct, but that I was unsure how to add that to the article. Since you have worked extensively on the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah_81c5.html" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City</a> article, I wonder if you might have any input as to how we should phrase this info and where it should be added?</p>
<p>Second, I wonder if you could possibly whip up some sort of a lake effect section, subsection, or whatever for this article? I ask because you mentioned this in the past and I have exhausted myself somewhat working on this article. Here is a Deseret News source that might be useful, if you have the time: <a href="http://deseretnews.com/misc/gsl/105002200.htm" class="external text" title="http://deseretnews.com/misc/gsl/105002200.htm" rel="nofollow">Lake has great impact on storms, weather</a></p>
<p>Lastly, thank you for copy editing this article. I plan to submit it for peer review once it reaches GA status, but before that, I wonder if you have any input on how to improve the article? As a part of this, could you look over and maybe edit the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreat_Salt_Lake_to_do_c6b4.html" title="Talk:Great Salt Lake/to do">to do list</a> I created awhile back? Currently it mostly deals with what needs to be added, and most of that (perhaps all) was added by me, which makes me a bit uncomfortable as I shouldn't be the only one defining goals. --<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethargy_6191.html" title="User:Lethargy">Lethargy</a> 04:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, premature I know. However, I was thinking if there was a major event in September or October, it is better to have it ready (it does occasionally happen in the higher Plains). It won't be well organized until October most likely.</p>
<p>I feel they should run from July 1 to June 30 because the vast majority of people visiting here are from the Northern Hemisphere, and there are few areas in the Southern Hemisphere (save Antarctica and nothing is notable there except for record cold) that heavy snow is worthy of mention. It will resemble the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornadoes_of_2006.html" title="Tornadoes of 2006">Tornadoes of 2006</a> page (speaking of which, I have the shell for the 2005 article underway, and will add more in the next few weeks). <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 05:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good luck to trying to raise the activity of the Meteorology project, its unfortunate that its inactive like it is. One of the biggest problems is that a much higher proportion of articles in the wider project should be about meteorological phenomena as opposed to individual events.

<p>Nice work! Those predictions seem reasonable, but I bet the Texans aren't that bad this year they were last year. I think they will go for 9-7 this year (:P).In the AFC South, the Titans will be the worst team with 2-14 (damn Vince Young). The Chiefs didn't look good vs. the Texans either, however it's just preseason, so I won't make any predictions here. (I guess my predictions will be wrong too.)

<p>Since you are the best weather person in WikiProject Utah, I wonder if you could help me expand and improve the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City_Tornado_3a28.html" title="Salt Lake City Tornado">Salt Lake City Tornado</a> article? I have written up what I feel are the first things we need to improve on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Talk%7ESalt_Lake_City_Tornado_12cb.html" title="Talk:Salt Lake City Tornado">the talk page</a>, if you want to look over those and add any input.</p>
<p>Oh, and I think the Salt Lake City article looks pretty good. I see a few problems with wording and POV (which I might elaborate more on when I look over the article again), but with a little work and a few more citations, I think we can submit this at FAC with a pretty good chance of passing, or at least we might receive input on things we can fix quickly enough to pass. If it becomes too daunting, we could always submit it at the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_Article_Collaboration_of_the_week_8114.html" title="Wikipedia:Good Article Collaboration of the week">Good Article Collaboration of the week</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethargy_6191.html" title="User:Lethargy">Lethargy</a> 21:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the 2006 weather stuff looks pretty good, I wouldn't mind seeing it as an article.
<ul>
<li>You may be able to expand individual months by adding a paragraph comparing it with average years and recent years, such as "blah was relatively dry compared to previous years, with blah amount of snow compared to blah average. Early in the month temperatures were lower than those in 2005, but later days had risen above average". Of course it wouldn't look so bad as something I whipped up under the influence of sunburn and headache.</li>
<li>The only other problem is that the references aren't footnotes, which seem to be preferred, but that is a minor issue.</li>
<li>I love that you included information on the status of the drought, I enjoy tracking that or at least I <i>would</i> enjoy it if I knew where I could find more information. Are there other articles like this one for previous years, or articles covering the "recent" drought?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lake-effect stuff looks great, now the article feels relatively complete, although not totally comprehensive. The main thing I still need to add is Legacy Highway info. I wrote a report on it for eighth-grade science years ago, but I seem to have forgotten everything about it so I guess I need to read up on the current situation.</li>

<p>Looking over what was reverted:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The streets are known for being wide and spacious"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This one bothers me, because it isn't really possible to verify that they are "known" for this, but we <i>can</i> prove that the original settlers wanted them to be wide. I prefer focusing on the facts, rather than public perceptions.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"He has also been accused of abusive and demanding working conditions by former staffers"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If there are too many to name specifically, a citation for this info would suffice. I am unfamiliar with this incident, so I would like to have a link to an article I could read on this topic. This one probably didn't need the {{<a href="../../../w/h/o/Template%7EWho_5422.html" title="Template:Who">who</a>}} tag, but it does need {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}. A bit of a brain fart (I hate that term) on my part.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"...and the primary <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29_0192.html" title="Independence Day (United States)">Fourth of July</a> fireworks in the city."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I removed "primary" was because I wasn't sure we could actually verify this, although I don't have a huge problem with this being reverted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see your point on the excessive citation needed tags, but I'm not sure if this will pass FAC without a few more citations. The info that is too difficult to verify could just be removed, if it is not incredibly important. I get the impression that much of the info here was written before WP started requiring inline citations, so we have to dig them up now. Also, I have noticed that anons tend to add info without supporting citations, but when I add a request to verify it, the request is ignored.</p>
<p>here is an explanation of a few of the citation needed tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>"There is about a fourteen to fifteen minute of arc variation of the grid from true north."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have never heard this before, and I can't say if it is true or not. Where did this come from?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"most counties in Indiana use a similar scheme in designating county roads"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>We don't necessarily need to have this comparison, and I couldn't find a source online.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Many of the Pacific Islanders are members of the LDS Church."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This one is particularly problematic, because you run into the "how many is many" arguments, and no reference was provided.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Councilors are elected under specific issues and are usually well-known."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What does "elected under specific issues" mean, and are they actually well-known? This sounds like someone who lives here has this impression, but it might not be verifiable (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>). It could probably be removed without a problem.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Party platforms are centered on education, economic development, and transportation."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have no idea where that came from. Original research?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"He is supportive of same-sex marriage, the Kyoto Treaty, transit-oriented urban planning, alternative energy sources, and the relaxation of Utah state liquor laws."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I know he supports same-sex marriage and the relaxation of liquor laws, but the rest is news to me. People who don't live in Utah would probably require a citation or two to verify what he supports.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"...and Israel's ambassador to the United States opened a cultural center."</li>

<ul>
<li>You said: <i>Secondly, but not least, is your almost dictatorial removal of supposed weasel words and peacock terms (a term which I didn't know about until today). Certainly the inclusion of most of what you removed is not detrimental to the encyclopedia. Wikipedia has recently come under an insane number of rules and regulations to the point of you need citations for everything and the inclusion of even one weasel word or peacock term is detrimental to the encyclopedia, almost to the point of violating the standards of the English language. (Are there better terms to replace these weasel words with? Certainly the removal of some of these not only is detrimental to the writing quality, but are not even improving the encyclopedia. The inclusion of some weasel words is necessary to properly explain and display that piece of information.)</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It was the "well-known" that bothered me. I have no way to verify if it is well-known that he supports one thing or another, it is better to just state what he supports.

</dd>
<dd><i>Surely you've heard about the education and transportation problems in the city?</i>
<dl>
<dd>I have. The education problem is a more statewide problem than just SLC, but that is irrelevant. I would prefer to make it easy to verify this info for those who don't live here.</dd>

<p>Hi, Bob rulz/Jason. I'm moabalan, new to Wikipedia and kind of stumbling around to learn the way things are done. I'm not even sure that I can contact you this way, so I'm going to quit now. If it looks like there will be communication, I'll go on.</p>
<p>Okay. You removed a comment I made on the book, Hiking the Wasatch, after apparently the vandalism bot pointed it out. I see that some time ago, the bot earmarked one of your writings, but you note that "it wasn't vandalism." I'm new enough I don't know all that well what vandalism is, but I quickly read a wiki discussion that seemed to include the intent of purposefully inserting untrue info, or removing good info.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that wiki is created to only allow things that someone, somewhere has put down in writing (no original research). Nothing creative, just cite the literature. I think I got that yesterday. I think it means I'm a hell of a lot less excited about Wiki than I was, because my creative writing means much to me, and Wikipedia isn't a place for everybody to opine about things, no matter how well founded the opinions.</p>
<p>Let's go back to my note on Hiking the Wasatch. I don't make money from it. The author isn't my friend. I haven't met him. I think I can do a better job of keeping personal opinion out of what I write next. But there isn't a large body of published information about hiking in the Wasatch, and nobody has spent as much time as this author on the subject of hiking around Salt Lake City. Doesn't it serve a good purpose to point that out in an article on the Wasatch?</p>
<p>Okay. Enough for now. I appreciate any response.</p>

<p>Moabalan back again. Would be good if you read the "Questions" post below before this one. I just discovered my own talk page. I see that there's a note about advertising. Perhaps you put it there. I don't mind, but I haven't written anything here to promote my own work. I think that, especially in an encyclopedia built up bit by bit by amateurs, bibliographical information is very valuable. One can tell at a glance that Wiki doesn't tell us much about the Wasatch Mountains. Once I understand better what a stub is, I'll know whether to designate it as a stub. I once considered writing a book on these mountains; we could do well with a properly done article here that was at least three pages.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things an article can do is to tell me where I can go to get better, longer treatment of the subject. Does Wikipedia have any specific policy on commenting on the content and value of the references we give? The bias appears to be against it, or is it just that people tend not to do it? Thanks.</p>

<p>Why do you feel only your story of the Broncos should be told? If someone already has a game posted, edit it for POV or errors, but why are you totally rewriting it?</p>

<p>Shouldn't the UT SR WP be under your list of WikiProjects? I wanted to add that, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed to.
