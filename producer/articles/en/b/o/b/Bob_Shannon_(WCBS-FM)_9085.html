	    <p>Radio DJ originally known as <b>Don Bombard</b> (born: December 16, 1948) but more widely known under the air name <b>Bob Shannon</b>, was first introduced on radio by legendary sportscaster <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marv_Albert_9220.html" title="Marv Albert">Marv Albert</a> as the winner of a guest deejay contest, while still a junior high school student in his hometown of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>
<p>At age 15, Don experimented with broadcasting from his home, using a radio that had the wiring reversed to become a transmitter. The radio's antenna was hooked to a radiator, utilizing the water pipes to get the signal out to his neighborhood. He then graduated to a running full-fledged pirate radio station, WQBR. The call letters stood for "we quit buying records" -- so named because he actually was receiving free promo copies of new releases from record companies. The station broadcast with a 50 watt Navy surplus AM transmitter but was ordered off the air by the <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a> since it was interfering with planes overhead.</p>
<p>He joined the staff of Syracuse University station <a href="http://www.waer.org" class="external text" title="http://www.waer.org" rel="nofollow">WAER-FM</a> as a freshman in 1965. At the time the station banned playing any current popular music, and programmed only classical, "dinner music" and acoustic folk. In 1968 Don succeeded in creating and hosting a "documentary" show on the history of Soul Music, which he presented as a countdown of the current Top 20 Soul Hits. This program broke the "non-rock" barrier at the campus station and opened the door for wider programming.</p>
<p>Don came to the attention of the local Syracuse Top 40 stations WNDR and <a href="http://www.wolf1490.net" class="external text" title="http://www.wolf1490.net" rel="nofollow">WOLF</a> when, as a teenager, he compiled and distributed his own weekly music survey known as <a href="http://bobshannon.com/specials/images/big50.html" class="external text" title="http://bobshannon.com/specials/images/big50.html" rel="nofollow">The Big 50</a>. The accuracy of the list caused local stores to begin stocking their records from it, and he became a competitor to the two radio stations and their surveys.</p>
<p>Don then went on to work at both stations from 1967 to 1977, where he gained experience as an announcer, music director, and programmer. He joined WNDR in 1967 as a part-time weekend dj, and worked 18 out of 24 hours every Sunday (midnight to 6AM as a dj, 12 noon to 6PM doing news, and then 6PM to midnight djing again). In 1968 he accepted an offer by WOLF to work full-time on their night show. The station had dropped Top 40 music and was then playing Country. He became the station's music director and was given freedom to expand the format at night with an all-request show, with the motto "we play anything" (a phrase currently revived by many "Jack" type radio stations). In 1969, he was part of the team that returned WOLF to a Top 40 format and remained as music director and night dj until the following year, when he was hired back full-time at WNDR.</p>
<p>There, he hosted a late-night "Attitude Hours" progressive rock show. Later he became assistant program director and afternoon drive dj, as well as taking over the reins of the already-established "Saturday Night of Gold" oldies show.</p>
<p>In 1975, he left radio briefly to run "Don Bombard Disco", a company formed with partner Guy Capone (who had been his high school partner in the Big 50 project). He returned to WOLF the following year and became program director.</p>
<p>While in Syracuse Don collaborated with local music historian Ron Wray (aka Ron Gersbacher aka The Syracuse Music Authority) on a documentary history of WOLF ("The WOLF Story") and a series of "History of Syracuse Music" albums. He also formed (with Wray) Piece Records -- based on his then sign-off: "Peace -- anyway you spell it". The label name was later changed to Eceip due to indecency protests. The label's biggest hit (Top 10 on WOLF) was Don singing a version of Van Trevor's "Satisfaction Is Guaranteed" backed by local garage band Headstone II (the flip featured a psychedelic instrumental with Wray's voice called "Speed").</p>
<p>In 1977, Don moved to <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> to work at station <a href="http://user.pa.net/~ejjeff/13qstart.htm" class="external text" title="http://user.pa.net/~ejjeff/13qstart.htm" rel="nofollow">13Q</a> (WKTQ) He began as production director and then moved to afternoon drive dj. He originated and hosted “The Sunday Night Oldies Party” and brought back the legendary Pittsburgh music and djs. The show became the highest-rated in Pittsburgh radio history, with a 25% share of the audience. Among the highlights were Stump The DJ and other music-oriented contests, as well as Mr. Blues and Music For Lovers segments. His partner was Dave Goodrich, known as "The Doctor of Rock &amp; Roll". Don also released (with record collector Frank DeMino) a compilation album called "The Pittsburgh Hall of Fame". He also did booth announcing for <a href="../../../w/p/x/WPXI_5706.html" title="WPXI">WPXI</a> television.</p>
<p>In late 1981 Don moved to New York City to work part-time at a recording studio owned by <a href="http://www.anncrman.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anncrman.com" rel="nofollow">Wendell Craig</a>, formerly dj Windy Craig at WOLF. While there, with Craig's blessings, he launched a radio syndication company called Sirius Productions (whose logo looked uncannily like the current logo of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius Satellite Radio</a>). Don then began as a fill-in announcer at <a href="../../../w/q/h/WQHT_6436.html" title="WQHT">WYNY</a> and <a href="../../../w/c/b/WCBS-FM_5140.html" title="WCBS-FM">WCBS-FM</a> as well as doing some booth announcing for <a href="../../../w/w/o/WWOR-TV_4397.html" title="WWOR-TV">WWOR-TV</a>. He was Don Bombard on WYNY, but at CBS-FM (which already had Don K. Reed) his on-air name was changed to Bob Shannon by program director Joe McCoy.</p>
<p>Bob launched a weekend overnight spin-off of his Pittsburgh show on CBS-FM called "The Oldies Party" and continued to tape a weekly Sunday night show for airing in Pittsburgh. He also briefly hosted the Saturday night show vacated by Jack Spector. In 1982, he was promoted to the full-time 6-10PM shift and originated (with music director Richard Lorenzo) a nightly "Hall of Fame" segment. In 1986, with the exit of Dick Heatherton, he took over the the afternoon drive time slot, where he remained until the station's demise in 2005.</p>
<p>At CBS-FM he gained a reputation as an expert musicologist, with numerous music features such as "Rockeology", "Hands Across the Water", "First and Foremost" and others. His humorous on-air style earned him the nickname "The Prince of Puns" (dubbed by George Maksian of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a>). Bob's audience also enjoyed his repartee with newsman Al Meredith and traffic reporters Dennis O'Mara and Lori Jordan.</p>
<p>During his long stint at CBS-FM, Bob interviewed almost every important heritage music act. This lead to incorporating his music features and behind the scenes interviews in a book co-authored with John Javna. "Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll" was published by Warner Books in 1986 and was the forerunner of the "behind the..." trend later used by <a href="../../../v/h/-/VH-1_ba5a.html" title="VH-1">VH-1</a> with "Behind The Music" and numerous others. The book is now out of print but excerpts are available on <a href="http://BobShannon.com" class="external text" title="http://BobShannon.com" rel="nofollow">Bob's website</a>, which he launched in 1997.</p>
<p>Bob has also hosted a number of nationally syndicated radio shows, including "The Oldies Countdown" for MJI Broadcasting and "Keeping The '70s Alive" and "Behind The Hits" for On The Radio Broadcasting. He also co-hosted, with CBS-FM's Bobby Jay, live broadcasts for <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westwood_One_da03.html" title="Westwood One">Westwood One</a> from the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_d7e8.html" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> induction ceremonies in New York.</p>
<p>Bob was about to go on air on June 3, 2005 when he was told of an impending format change at WCBS FM. At 4PM he joined his fellow employees, including long-time CBS-FM dj Bill Brown, in a conference room meeting (the rest of the djs were on a phone conference call because the meeting was announced last minute). It was announced that CBS FM was being shut down and replaced with an "Adult Hits" format called <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_FM_a2b7.html" title="Jack FM">Jack FM</a> -- which had been originated on the Internet by radio personality and consultant Bob Perry. The format, which has no announcers, was breaking out across the country, and CBS's parent company Infinity (<a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Radio_92be.html" title="CBS Radio">CBS Radio</a>) had acquired first-refusal rights to use it at their stations. At 5PM the station changed to the Jack format and Bob Shannon, along with the rest of the airstaffers, were laid off. Most, including him, have not since returned to full-time radio work.</p>
<p>Bob currently does a weekly show, with wife Connie T. Empress, on <a href="http://wlng.com" class="external text" title="http://wlng.com" rel="nofollow">WLNG</a>, Long Island, NY. Bob can also be heard on the Internet as he co-hosts a weekly “Behind the Hits” show on <a href="http://vipradio.net" class="external text" title="http://vipradio.net" rel="nofollow">VIP Radio</a> in Europe (which also features Connie's Soul Club Hour and former CBS-FM djs Bobby Jay and Dick Heatherton). Since CBS-FM, Bob and Connie have also been heard on <a href="http://www.radiomaxmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.radiomaxmusic.com" rel="nofollow">RadioMaxMusic</a> and <a href="http://rhythmandgold.com" class="external text" title="http://rhythmandgold.com" rel="nofollow">Rhythm &amp; Gold</a>. He has also guested on <a href="http://ghtradio.com" class="external text" title="http://ghtradio.com" rel="nofollow">WGHT</a> in North Jersey and with <a href="http://www.classicsoul.com" class="external text" title="http://www.classicsoul.com" rel="nofollow">Felix Hernandez</a> on <a href="http://www.wbgo.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wbgo.org" rel="nofollow">WBGO</a>. He has also filled in for <a href="http://goldengup.com/" class="external text" title="http://goldengup.com/" rel="nofollow">The Golden Gup</a> on <a href="http://wmtram.com" class="external text" title="http://wmtram.com" rel="nofollow">WMTR</a> in Morristown, NJ.</p>
<p>In 2005, he and Connie held a fundraising soul dance for 14 Essex County and national charities called "Spring Into Action". The event, which featured live performances by Baby Washington, Freddie Scott and The Legendary Teenagers was broadcast simultaneously on four Internet radio stations. Bob has also participated annually with "Cousin Brucie" <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Morrow_e1b7.html" title="Bruce Morrow">Bruce Morrow</a> for the <a href="http://www.varietyny.org" class="external text" title="http://www.varietyny.org" rel="nofollow">Variety Children's Charity</a> telethon and has worked with <a href="http://www.worldhungeryear.org" class="external text" title="http://www.worldhungeryear.org" rel="nofollow">World Hunger Year</a> on their annual radiothon.</p>
<p>Bob became the moderator of an Internet CBS-FM message board and then continued to moderate a new <a href="http://www.musicradio77.com/bobboard/wwwboard/bobboard1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicradio77.com/bobboard/wwwboard/bobboard1.html" rel="nofollow">Behind The Hits Message Board</a>.</p>
<p>On February 17, 2007, Bob was back on the air with a regular gig at New Jersey's <a href="http://www.breezeradio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.breezeradio.com" rel="nofollow">The Breeze</a>. His show airs Saturdays from 11AM to 3PM, and Sundays from 12PM to 4PM.</p>
<p>Bob was interviewed by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Simone_3bcb.html" title="Mark Simone">Mark Simone</a> on the second show of WABC’s <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Oldies_b7bc.html" title="Saturday Night Oldies">Saturday Night Oldies</a> on December 10, 2005.</p>
<p>Bob’s sign-off is “Be seeing you!”, a phrase taken from the '60s TV show "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html" title="The Prisoner">The Prisoner</a>".</p>
<p>Note: Not to be confused with dj <b>Bob Shannon</b> who also worked in Pittsburgh at KDKA. That Shannon became famous in radio in Phoenix (KXIV/KRUX), Los Angeles (KHJ/KRTH), Buffalo (WKBW) and other markets.
