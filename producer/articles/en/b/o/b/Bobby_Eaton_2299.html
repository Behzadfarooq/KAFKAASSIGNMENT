<p>Growing up in Huntsville, Alabama <b>Bobby Eaton</b> was a big fan of professional wrestling, especially the <b>NWA Mid-America</b> territory promoted by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Gulas_2042.html" title="Nick Gulas">Nick Gulas</a>. Eaton became involved in wrestling at the age of thirteen while going to Chapman Middle School, helping to set up rings in his hometown. In an early age he went to Lincoln Elementary, Chapman Middle, Lee High, and Butler High. He lived in the Lincoln Mills area off of Oakwood Ave. He had a little group of people that the hung with the Osborne brothers Danny and David and a few more. He played childhood sports at the Boy's Club in the Lincoln Mills area with the Osborne brothers. Eaton helped set up the wrestling ring for events in Huntsville and thus found his way into the world of professional wrestling.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Eaton_2299.html" title="Edit section: Starting Out">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Starting Out</span></h3>
<p>Eaton trained under <a href="../../../t/o/j/Tojo_Yamamoto_dd62.html" title="Tojo Yamamoto">Tojo Yamamoto</a> and in 1976 at the age of seventeen made his debut, losing to Bearcat Wright. He quickly became a regular in the local wrestling territories paying his dues early one while still learning the ropes. Eaton persevered and worked hard to improve and it was not long until Eaton’s athleticism and showmanship was noticed by the fans and promoter Nick Gulas. The feud that first pushed Eaton’s name up the card was when <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollywood_Blondes_0614.html" title="The Hollywood Blondes">The Hollywood Blondes</a> (Jerry Brown &amp; <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Hey_1d63.html" title="Dale Hey">Buddy Roberts</a>) came into the territory. Eaton fought the Blondes with a variety of partners such as his old trainer Tojo Yamamoto and <a href="../../../p/e/z/Pez_Whatley_4dad.html" title="Pez Whatley">”Pistol” Pez Whatley</a> running the duo off (or at least that was the story, in reality the Blondes signed with thea rival promotion)</p>
<p>In 1978 Eaton teamed up with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanny_Poffo_09fc.html" title="Lanny Poffo">Leapin’ Lanny Poffo</a> and won the Mid-American Tag-Team titles from Gypsy Joe and <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkyard_Dog_eb66.html" title="Junkyard Dog">Leroy Rochester</a> and holding them for a little over a month. Bobby Eaton would go on to team with George Gulas to form the team <b>The Jet Set</b> and together hold the Mid-American tag titles three times. During their time as a team the two feuded with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Gordy_8e1d.html" title="Terry Gordy">Terry Gordy</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Hayes_%28wrestler%29_a438.html" title="Michael Hayes (wrestler)">Michael Hayes</a> <i>before</i> they took the name <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabulous_Freebirds_3cec.html" title="Fabulous Freebirds">The Fabulous Freebirds</a></b>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Eaton_2299.html" title="Edit section: Coming of Age">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coming of Age</span></h3>
<p>In the spring of 1979 Bobby Eaton started a feud with <b>Chris Colt</b> which was the feud that established that Eaton was more than just a good tag-team competitor. The feud was so heated that it saw Chris Colt suspended for piledriving Eaton on the concrete floor (In those days the Piledriver was banned in most federations and only used in the most extreme circumstances) In the end Bobby Eaton vanquished Chris Colt and took his place as one of the top faces in Gulas’ territory. During 1979/80 Bobby Eaton found himself contesting a series of singles matches again <b><a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Condrey_37fa.html" title="Dennis Condrey">Dennis Condrey</a></b>, the very same man he’d end up teaming with a few years down the road.</p>
<p>At the end of 1979 the beloved Bobby Eaton turned heel by joining up with Tojo Yamamoto’s group of wrestlers, while Eaton today is thought of mainly as a heel this was a huge shock to Eaton’s fans. Eaton’s heel run did not last long as he rescued his former “Jet Set” partner George Gulas from a 2 on 1 attack by <b>the Blonde Bombers</b> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Latham_%28wrestler%29_bf94.html" title="Larry Latham (wrestler)">Larry Latham</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honky_Tonk_Man_890d.html" title="The Honky Tonk Man">Wayne Ferris</a>) reuniting the team for one final run with the Mid-American tag-team titles and a heated feud with Latham &amp; Ferris.</p>
<p>When Nick Gulas’ territory went under Eaton wrestled in Georgia before returning to the Memphis area working for promoter <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Jarrett_58e1.html" title="Jerry Jarrett">Jerry Jarrett</a>, in the early days in the territory Bobby Eaton would team with a young <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Lane_529c.html" title="Stan Lane">Stan Lane</a>, a name that would pop up again later in Eaton’s career. But Eaton’s most famous parter in Jerry Jarrett’s promotion was without a doubt <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ware_%28wrestler%29_2e52.html" title="James Ware (wrestler)">Sweet Brown Sugar</a> (Koko B. Ware), the two blended high flying and athleticism to form a team that would hold the <a href="../../../a/w/a/AWA_Southern_Tag_Team_Championship_9781.html" title="AWA Southern Tag Team Championship">AWA Southern Tag Team Championship</a> twice with manager <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hart_65e9.html" title="Jimmy Hart">Jimmy Hart</a> in their corner. After achieving great success as tag-team partners Bobby Eaton and Sweet Brown Sugar eventually started to feud, resulting in Eaton driving Sugar out of the territory after he won a “Losers Leaves Town” match.</p>
<p>Strangely enough a masked man called <b>Stagger Lee</b> who looked and wrestled like Sweet Brown Sugar appeared a short time after. After briefly winning and losing the Southern tag-team titles to <b>The Fabulous Ones</b> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Lane_529c.html" title="Stan Lane">Stan Lane</a> &amp; <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Keirn_9cf8.html" title="Steve Keirn">Steve Keirn</a>) Eaton teamed up with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Moondogs_b752.html" title="The Moondogs">the Moondogs</a> to face Jerry Lawler and the Fabulous Ones, during the match one of the Moondogs accidentally hit Eaton with their trademark bone costing them the match. After the bell run the Moondogs as well as Jimmy Hart turned on Bobby Eaton beating him down until he was saved by Stagger Lee.</p>

The Midnight Express &amp; Jim Cornette</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>For more on the long history of the Midnight Express before and after Bobby Eaton was a part of it see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midnight_Express_%28professional_wrestling%29_9933.html" title="The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)">The Midnight Express</a></i></p>
<p>When Eaton joined the Mid-South territory under booker <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Watts_8107.html" title="Bill Watts">Bill Watts</a> he quickly joined the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cornette_c874.html" title="Jim Cornette">Jim Cornette</a>. The Express had up until then been a stable but once Eaton and Condrey joined together the Midnight Express wrestled exclusively as a 2 man team. Eaton was nicknamed “Beautiful” Bobby to compliment “Loverboy” Dennis, a nickname that Eaton still uses to this very day. The Express’ first target was the Mid-South champions <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnum_T.A._34fa.html" title="Magnum T.A.">Magnum T.A.</a> and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Wrestling_II_b2dd.html" title="Mr. Wrestling II">Mr. Wrestling II</a>, the highlight of the feud had to be Eaton and Condrey tarring and feathering Magnum TA. The Express got their first gold when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum TA allowing Eaton and Condrey to walk away with the titles.</p>
<p>The duo had just won the gold when they ran into the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%26_Roll_Express_64ec.html" title="Rock &amp; Roll Express">Rock &amp; Roll Express</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Morton_1c08.html" title="Ricky Morton">Ricky Morton</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuben_Kane_6e38.html" title="Reuben Kane">Robert Gibson</a>) and kicked off their legendary feud that would run well into the 90ties. The two Expresses had a series of matches that were so unlike how tag-team wrestling was usually presented by in the Mid-South gathering a lot of attention both locally and nationally. They feuded through out 1984 in the Mid-South territory before the Midnight Express was ready to move on</p>
<p>The Midnight Express had a short say in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Class_Championship_Wrestling_dd98.html" title="World Class Championship Wrestling">World Class Championship Wrestling</a> where they feuded mainly with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fantastics_2a76.html" title="The Fantastics">The Fantastics</a> but when opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere the Midnight Express made a big change.</p>
<p><a name="National_Spotlight" id="National_Spotlight"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Eaton_2299.html" title="Edit section: National Spotlight">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">National Spotlight</span></h3>
<p>In 1985 Eaton, Condrey and Cornette signed with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crockett_Promotions_2a91.html" title="Jim Crockett Promotions">Jim Crockett Promotions</a> and thus got exposed on a national level through JCP’s deal with <a href="../../../t/b/s/TBS_%28TV_network%29_dfab.html" title="TBS (TV network)">SuperStation TBS</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after joining the territory the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock &amp; Roll Express whom they won the <a href="../../../n/w/a/NWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship_%28Mid_Atlantic_version%29_1b2b.html" title="NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid Atlantic version)">NWA World Tag-Team titles</a> in February of 1986 and lost the titles back to the Rock &amp; Roll Express 6 months later. Besides feuding with the Rock &amp; Roll Express Eaton &amp; Condrey also had a long running feuds with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Breed_%28tag_team%29_7d5a.html" title="New Breed (tag team)">The New Breed</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Road_Warriors_b61e.html" title="The Road Warriors">The Road Warriors</a> including a high profile <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_match_types.html#Scaffold_Match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Scaffold Match</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starrcade.html#1986" title="Starrcade">Starrcade 1986</a> which the Midnight Express lost.</p>
<p>In the early parts of 1987 Dennis Condrey left JCP from one day to the next, no specific reason has ever been given by Dennis Condrey only speculations from people around him. Whatever the explanation the problem was still that Eaton was without a partner, enter another man from Eaton’s past, another former opponent now tag-team partner: “Sweet” Stan Lane. Lane and Eaton knew each other well from working against each other in the past and this showed as the new version of the Midnight Express gelled from the beginning.</p>
<p>In May of 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane proved to be a golden one as they won the <a href="../../../n/w/a/NWA_United_States_Tag_Team_Championship_b02e.html" title="NWA United States Tag Team Championship">NWA US Tag-Team titles</a> (A title they would win three times during their time together). A year later the team was cheered on to victory as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag-Team Titles from <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arn_Anderson_28eb.html" title="Arn Anderson">Arn Anderson</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tully_Blanchard_25af.html" title="Tully Blanchard">Tully Blanchard</a> <i>(See also: <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_Busters_14a1.html" title="Brain Busters">Brain Busters</a>)</i> on September 10, 1988. The Midnight Express’ run with the titles only last a little over a month and a half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up that saw the Road Warriors turn heel (bad guys) and the Midnight Express turn face (good guys).</p>
<p>Now the fan favorites the Midnight Express soon had to content with a blast from the past: The Midnight Express. Only this Midnight Express was billed as <b>The Original Midnight Express</b> as it consisted of Dennis Condrey and <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Rose_b77a.html" title="Randy Rose">Randy Rose</a> who had teamed up before Condrey and Eaton became a team. The duo was led by long time Jim Cornette nemesis <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Heyman_926c.html" title="Paul Heyman">Paul E. Dangerously</a> in the hopes of proving that the originals were better than the new version. The shock of seeing the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously’s team the initial advantage in the feud but once again Dennis Condrey left, being replaced by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Victory_9a6d.html" title="Jack Victory">Jack Victory</a> to cut the feud short.</p>
<p>Due to various booking issues Jim Cornette and the Midnight Express left the promotion for a short while, around the time that <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Turner_f6c6.html" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a> brought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Wrestling_Alliance_182e.html" title="National Wrestling Alliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> / <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Championship_Wrestling_d0d3.html" title="World Championship Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a>. When the booking issues started to clear up Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the federation and a very strong tag-team division. One of those teams was The Dynamic Dudes (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_Douglas_49ee.html" title="Shane Douglas">Shane Douglas</a> &amp; <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Ace_a897.html" title="Johnny Ace">Johnny Ace</a>) , who admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite team and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed but the Midnight Express were not happy about it at all. After arguing Jim Cornette stopped accompanying the Express to the ring, choosing to only manage the Dudes. At the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_Champions_d780.html#Clash_of_Champions_IX" title="Clash of Champions">Clash of Champions IX</a> the two teams met with Jim Cornette in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressive, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites and when the night was over the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner, Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.</p>
<p>After their heel turn the Midnight Express started feuding with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Pillman_8478.html" title="Brian Pillman">Flyin’ Brian</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Zenk_8e48.html" title="Tom Zenk">”Z-Man” Tom Zenk</a> over the recently re-activated US Tag-Team titles, winning the gold from the young team in early 1990. The Midnight Express would lose the titles to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Steiner_Brothers_d613.html" title="The Steiner Brothers">The Steiner Brothers</a> 3 months later.</p>
<p>After appearing at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_Havoc_ce5f.html#1990" title="Halloween Havoc">Halloween Havoc 1990</a> the Midnight Express split up when Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation. For the first time in 7 years there was no Midnight Express, it was the end of an era in tag-team wrestling.</p>

<p>Being on his own for the first time in years Eaton faced an uphill struggle to establish himself as a singles competitor (Ironically he had faced the same issue in 1979 in Nick Gulas’ territory)</p>
<p>Eaton battled guys he had faced in tag-team competition before such as Ricky Morton and “Z-Man” Tom Zenk, turning face during the early parts of 1991. At <a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperBrawl_44c7.html#SuperBrawl_I" title="SuperBrawl">SuperBrawl I</a> Eaton defeated Arn Anderson to win the <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_World_Television_Championship_9492.html" title="WCW World Television Championship">WCW World Television Championship</a> proving to everyone that he was more than just a tag-team wrestler. Eaton’s biggest night as a singles wrestler came when he faced off against <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_World_Heavyweight_Championship_c8a6.html" title="WCW World Heavyweight Championship">WCW World Champion</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">”Nature Boy” Ric Flair</a> at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_the_Champions_cb0a.html" title="Clash of the Champions">Clash of the Champions XV|Clash of the Champions XV</a> in a 2 out of 3 falls match. Eaton pinned Ric Flair in the first fall but ultimately fell to Ric Flair 2 falls to 1 in the biggest singles match Eaton ever competed in. His TV Title reign was shortlived as he came face to face with newcomer <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin_9bd5.html" title="Stone Cold Steve Austin">”Stunning” Steve Austin</a> who would cheat his way to the title. After dropping out of the Television Title run Eaton would go on to feud with <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Foundation_4faf.html" title="York Foundation">The York Foundation</a> before Paul E. Dangerously reappeared in WCW.</p>
<p>Late in 1990 Paul E. Dangerously formed <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dangerous_Alliance_5538.html" title="Dangerous Alliance">The Dangerous Alliance</a> where Eaton was joined with Arn Anderson, Steve Austin, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Rude_4571.html" title="Rick Rude">Rick Rude</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Zybysko_5b89.html" title="Larry Zybysko">Larry Zybysko</a>. In what seems to be a recurring pattern in Eaton’s career he was teamed up with former opponent Arn Anderson. Anderson and Eaton had always been known as great tag-team wrestlers so teaming came natural to them. The WCW World Tag-Team Titles soon came as well as the duo upended <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Steamboat_cca9.html" title="Ricky Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustin_Rhodes_ad8b.html" title="Dustin Rhodes">Dustin Rhodes</a> for the titles and held on to them for five months before losing the gold to the Steiner Brothers.</p>
<p>The Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW at one point they held every title save the WCW World Title (Held by their main arch enemy Sting). The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting &amp; Friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a <a href="../../../w/a/r/WarGames_match_a225.html" title="WarGames match">War Games Match</a> at <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestle_War_836f.html#1992" title="Wrestle War">Wrestle War 1992</a>. Sting’s Squadron won when Sting forced Eaton to submit to an arm bar after Larry Zybysko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the War Games match Larry Zybysko was kicked out of the Alliance and soon after the Alliance itself would disintegrate when Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson would continue to team for a while, managed by Michael Hayes until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost cutting measure.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Eaton_2299.html" title="Edit section: Fired and Hired">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fired and Hired</span></h3>
<p>When Eaton found himself without a job he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette who had stared his own federation, <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokey_Mountain_Wrestling_47fb.html" title="Smokey Mountain Wrestling">Smokey Mountain Wrestling</a>, which welcomed Bobby with open arms. Eaton paired up with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heavenly_Bodies_01ad.html" title="The Heavenly Bodies">The Heavenly Bodies</a> (Stan Lane &amp; <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Pritchard_9161.html" title="Tom Pritchard">Tom Pritchard</a>) and the three ran roughshot over the federation for a while. Eaton also won this federation’s version of the TV title while there.</p>
<p>When Bill Watts was ousted and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Bischoff_83ca.html" title="Eric Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> was put in charge of WCW Eaton was brought back and teamed up with a young <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Benoit_0875.html" title="Chris Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> during the future supertar’s first run with WCW. Together they put on a series of good matches but just like with his singles matches Eaton &amp; Benoit were mainly used to establish rising teams or give established teams a good match. Benoit and Eaton, while gelling in the ring never showed any signs of being a permanent team, they did not have matching ring outfits nor a team name.</p>
<p>Through out his career Eaton has thrived most in a tag-team environment, which explains why the majority of his career has been with a partner in his corner, and usually that partner is a former enemy. This turned out to be true for Eaton’s next venture in tag-teaming <b>Bad Attitude</b> where he teamed up with Steve Kerin. Bad Attitude had exactly ONE noteworthy moment together, they were present when Arn Anderson turned on tag-team partner Dustin Rhodes, otherwise the team did not get much exposure.</p>
<p>During this time Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW. He made an appearance at the "When Worlds Collide" show on May 14, 1994, where he teamed with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Brunk_0ea7.html" title="Terry Brunk">Sabu</a> to lose to Arn Anderson and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Funk_69e4.html" title="Terry Funk">Terry Funk</a>.</p>

<p>After Bad Attitude ended (Like everything else with this team: without great fanfare) Eaton caught the interest of British snob <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrin_Matthews_c826.html" title="Darrin Matthews">”Lord” Steven Regal</a> who tried to show the Alabama native some culture and sophistication. After a series of vignettes where Regal tried to educate Eaton <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Bloods_2d1c.html" title="Blue Bloods">The Blue Bloods</a> made their ring debut with Eaton being transformed into “Earl” Robert Eaton, a man of class and sophistication.</p>
<p>The team was joined by “Squire” David Taylor with the three alternating in the ring under the name of the Blue Bloods. The trio fueded with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlem_Heat_428f.html" title="Harlem Heat">Harlem Heat</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Booker_Huffman_504c.html" title="Booker Huffman">Booker T</a> &amp; <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lane_Huffman_e531.html" title="Lane Huffman">Stevie Ray</a>) and also <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stud_Stable_0224.html" title="Stud Stable">The Stud Stable</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Golden_d6f4.html" title="Jimmy Golden">Bunkhouse Buck</a> &amp; <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Slater_47c7.html" title="Dick Slater">Dick Slater</a>) over the <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_World_Tag_Team_Championship_cfee.html" title="WCW World Tag Team Championship">WCW World Tag Team Championship</a>. After losing to teams such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nasty_Boys_fe64.html" title="The Nasty Boys">the Nasty Boys</a> and the Steiner Brothers, Eaton left the group, rejecting the snob gimmick to briefly feud with Regal and Taylor.</p>
<p>Eaton’s time with the Blue Bloods was his last major push by WCW. He would wrestle mainly on <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_Saturday_Night_0b3d.html" title="WCW Saturday Night">WCW Saturday Night</a> in a jobber role and was managed by Teddy Long during 1998. He became a trainer at the Power Plant and worked backstage for WCW until 2000 where he was let go.</p>
<p>In 2003, he started working for NWA-Mid-Atlantic as the Midnight Express with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Nelson_%28wrestler%29_c487.html" title="Ricky Nelson (wrestler)">Ricky Nelson</a>, This Midnight Express version was very short lived as he started a tour with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Lane and Cornette) as the Midnight Express and they are still wrestling together on select Independent wrestling cards all over the United States.</p>
<p>Eaton made a one off appearance for <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling_e010.html" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> on August 13, 2003 as a part of <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kid_Kash_5aee.html" title="Kid Kash">Kid Kash</a> angle where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s greats such as Larry Zybysko and Ricky Morton. Eaton lost to Kid Kash in his only TNA appearance to date.</p>
<p>In January 2005, Eaton and Condrey were briefly managed by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Runnels_f384.html" title="Terri Runnels">Terri Runnels</a> in SCW when they wrestled The Fantastics for the vacant tag team titles (they lost). As of 2006, Eaton is still competing on the independent wrestling circuit. He worked two shows in April and one in July for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Wrestling_Association_15df.html" title="United Wrestling Association">United Wrestling Association</a> in <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville</a>.</p>

<p>Although Eaton wrestled as a heel for most of his career, he is widely regarded as one of the nicest guys in the wrestling business. In his 1999 book "Have a Nice Day" Mick Foley praised Eaton as being at once one of the most underrated superstars in the business and its nicest, quipping that "it was damn near impossible to pay for anything with Bobby around, though I will confess to not trying that hard." This opinion was supported in “the Stone Cold” truth by Steve Austin.</p>
<p>In addition to his personality, he is also popular with other wrestlers due to his wrestling style. Wrestling Eaton is known as "a night off", because his style is not punishing to the other wrestler even though it is very convincing. Although Bobby is not that big of a man as compared to other professional wrestlers, he has enormous hands.</p>
<p>On September 6th, 2006 Dave Meltzer reported that Eaton was hospitalized after suffering a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>.<a href="http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=26862" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=26862" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Two days later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement through <a href="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com" rel="nofollow">Wrestling Observer</a> saying:</p>
