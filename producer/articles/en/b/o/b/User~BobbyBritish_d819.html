<p>One day there was a guy named Bob. Then he died. The end.</p>
<p><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyBritish_d819.html" title="Edit section: CHAPTER 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHAPTER 2</span></h2>
<p>UNEXPECTED PLOT TWIST!!!! Suddenly, God spoke and said, “Bob, thou arst a freaking idiot, so thou musteth be ressurected because I’m boredeth.” ZOMG! So Bob was like, “Yeah, whatevah man.” Then a pirate ninja came and yelled, “IT’S TIME TO DUEL!”</p>
<p>So the pirate ninja pulled out his paper shuriken! But since he’s a pirate and has a hook for a hand, the shuriken got stuck. The pirate ninja’s eyes turned red, with a horrible lust for blood in them. Bob could see the fire in the pirate ninja’s eyes. Then the fire went all over the pirate ninja and he burned to death.</p>
<p>Bob stood shocked for a second, and then a single tear fell down his face. Unfortunately, it was a tear of hydrocloric acid, so Bob’s skin melted off.</p>
<p>Then Little Bo Peep lost her sheep, and the sheep mauled poor skinless Bob until Bob was nothing but a bloodsoaked skull. The bloodsoaked skull of Bob closed his eyes and looked up into the night sky, as the winter breeze blew across his face. The pirate ninja’s shuriken let out a low mourning roar, and a stunningly shiny crystal tomb arose around Bob’s head, which suffocated and died.</p>
<p>The paper shuriken said to Little Bo Peep’s sheep, “After all Bob did for us, this is something I could do for him.</p>
<p><a name="CHAPTER_3" id="CHAPTER_3"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyBritish_d819.html" title="Edit section: CHAPTER 3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHAPTER 3</span></h2>
<p>ANOTHER UNEXPECTED PLOT TWIST!!!! The Lord spoke and said, “Oh great, Bob’s deadeth. I must ressurect him againeth.” A tye-dye burst of light shone down from Heaven and Bob’s tomb shattered! The sheep blew up and Bob’s corpse came out.</p>
<p>The corpse flashed blue and began to sing the Czecoslovakian national anthem and somehow, magically, miraciously sent out tendrils of spaghetti to Bob’s head. The head and body were once again united, and Bob was born anew! I guess that means I have to write more about him. Crap.</p>
<p>Bob stood up with a new purpose. A new purpose that gave meaning to his life. His face hardened, his mouth set in a grimace. “It’s time,” he said.</p>
<p>Then he farted.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m done,” said Bob. “Now I better get my revenge on the person who killed me.” Bob paused and thought <i>who killed me?</i> So he went up to the paper shuriken and asked it, “Who killed me?” The shuriken turned around slowly and said to Bob, “Bob, I know who killed you. But... But... I’m not sure if I should tell you.”</p>
<p>Bob raised his left eyebrow at the shuriken, and then danced the can-can. After that he placed a comforting knife on the shuriken’s neck and said gently, “If you don’t give me answers, I will rip you into a thousand pieces, and burn them, and then feed the ashes to a gecko.”</p>
<p>The shuriken gulped and replied, “Okay, okay, I’ll tell you the truth. It started in the Semi-Great Depression of ninteen-eighty-twelve, ten years ago. Then I was just a plain old piece of paper trying to scrape by in this world. I was adopted by a pirate ninja named Forkleglooble, and christened Frankson McCheese. But most people just call me Frank.</p>
<p>“So Forkleglooble folded me into a shuriken, but never actually used me. Then about four years ago, something terrible happened. A mysterious hooded stranger showed up one day with a lightsaber. The stranger stared Forkleglooble straight in the eye and said, ‘So I heared youse a pirate ninja.’ And then the stranger put his hand up to Forkleglooble’s face, clenched his fist and yelled, ‘I got youse schnoz!’</p>
<p>“Then the stranger ran away with the nose. Forkleglooble ate some Cheerios, then took me and set out in hot pursuit of the stranger. He’s been searching ever since then.” Frank finished its story and noticed that Bob was asleep. Frank got one of those little angry things like they get in anime, and then started spinning really fast until it was more like a buzz saw than a shuriken. Frank whirred into Bob’s stomach and then cut him in half, and chicken noodle soup spilled everywhere.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyBritish_d819.html" title="Edit section: CHAPTER 4">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHAPTER 4</span></h2>
<p><i>YET ANOTHER</i> UNEXPECTED PLOT TWIST!!!! God spoketh again. “This is getting annoying. Why dost <i>I</i> have to ressurect Bob? I think Jesus should do it this time.” So God called Jesus on his cell phone and said, “Mine Son, could thou ressurect Bob?” So Jesus descended from Heaven upon the awestruck Frank. Then Jesus spit Jesus-spit on Bob, who started to glow like a drunken firefly. As Jesus rose back up, Bob called out after him. “Wait!” he said “I... I need to know!”</p>
<p>Jesus stopped and turned around. “Yes?” he asked. “How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?” said Bob. Then Bob shot a laser beam from his eyes to Jesus’ head and it asploded.</p>
<p>Bob trembled fearfully. “I just killed Jesus” he moaned. “Now will I be struck by lightning? <i>How could this happen to me?!”</i> Suddenly Brahmin materialized out of thin air, and screamed, “Shaddup boy!” then disappeared, leaving behing a smell of moldy potato chips.</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Frank opened his mouth to speak, but then paused akwardly when he remembered that shurikens don’t have mouths. Finally Bob said, “So, who killed me again?” Frank replied, “I’ll get to that. Anyway, me and Forkleglooble had been chasing the mysterious stranger for four long, difficult years. We had endured many hardships together, and our bond of friendship was unseverable. On one particularly stormy night, we went into a hotel called Hotel Duck. That’s... That’s when it happened.</p>
<p>“The guy at the front desk took our suitcase and cut it open with a chainsaw. And in it, we found the mysterious stranger! Forkleglooble pulled out his water gun and pointed it at the stranger’s head. He told the stranger not to move, then slowly reached down to the hood. He pulled on it, and in an unexpected plot twist saw that the stranger was Little Bo Peep! Little Bo Peep hung the guard with a yo-yo, then ran out the hotel really fast! Me and Forkleglooble chased after her in the Batmobile, but she was too fast!</p>
<p>“Then we came here, and she unleased her sheep on us. Forkleglooble said to me, ‘Frank, whatever happens, I want you to know, you’ll always be my best friend.’ So I took out my magnifying glass and fried him. Then the sheep killed you, remember?”</p>
<p>Bob stood staring at the ground in silence for a second, and then looked up at Frank. Well, he actually looked down, but you know what I mean. “Then I guess... I guess I’ll have to go after Little Bo Peep,” he said with determination in his voice.</p>
<p>Frank said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some, stupid, noble reason, isn’t it?” “It’s been like... like something out of someone else’s life, these last few weeks with you,” said Bob. “But I can’t... we can’t... I’ve got things to do alone now.” Frank did not cry, he simply looked at Bob.</p>
<p>“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used you as bait once, and that was just because he was fishing and had no worms left,” Harry, I mean Bob, finished off.</p>
<p>Tears glistened in Frank’s eyes, and he said, “Bob, whatever happens, I want you to know, you’ll always be my best friend.” He raised his hand in a solemn wave, and didn’t say anything as Bob walked slowly in to the setting sun. Frank slowly knelt down and collapsed into tears. Bob stepped on a land mine, and then exploded.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyBritish_d819.html" title="Edit section: CHAPTER 5">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHAPTER 5</span></h2>
<p>PREDICTABLE PLOT TWIST!!!! Once more the Lord rose and spoke. “Great, Jesus is dead. Maybe Brahmin can ressurect Bob.” God took out a big megaphone and said, “HEY, BRAHMIN? IS BRAHMIN HERE?” Brahmin came in the Batmobile he “borrowed” from Forkleglooble and asked, “Whaddya want?” God asked Brahmin to ressurect Bob, and then Brahmin opened his mouth to say, “Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you, why <i>do</i> ya want this Bob fellow ressurected all the time?” God sat on his thinking log, and then replied, “Well, that’s a good question. And frankly, I don’t know the answer. Just do it, okay?”</p>
<p>Down on Earth, Bob’s right arm started to wobble. Brahmin moved the arm into the socket by Bob’s shoulder, then moved it out again. He put the right arm in, he put the right arm out, the he shook it all around. He did the hokey-pokey cause that’s what it’s all about!</p>
<p>So Bob was, once again, alive. He picked himself up from the ground and stood in the same spot while the camera zoomed in on his face for a dramatic close-up. Bob looked into the distance with his binoculars, put them away, and started running. At first he ran slowish, but then faster, and faster!</p>
<p>He could see a racecar with advertisements plastered on it in the distance. It was getting closer, closer. He ran past it and yelled a wild cry of exhilaration. “YEEHAH!” Bob felt the wind running through his hair, the bugs flying into his open mouth.</p>
<p>Then the driver of the racecar took his foot of the brake pedal and zoomed past Bob, who was running at the amazing speed of 3 kilometers per hour. He fell down on the lush, green, grass, panting, with sweat running down his face. Then a macaroni-filled donut fell fromthe sky onto Bob’s head and knocked him unconcious.</p>
<p>He laid there for a while, until someone came and shoved a cattle prod up his nose. Bob opened his eyes blearily and saw someone who looked exactly like Little Bo Peep, except with a fake paper mustache taped on, which obviously meant it was a man. Bob was a little groggy from the fall and couldn’t quite focus his eyes. The man said in a very female-sounding voice, “Are you okay, man?” Bob replied by making a noise that sounded like a sick parrot with a fork shoved up its nose.</p>
<p>The man said, “Here, I’ll make it feel better.” He reached into his dress pocket and pulled out a toothpick, which he lit on fire and brandished like a torch. But before he could do any damage the toothpick burnt to ashes. The ashes fell into Bob’s eyes, which shot out of his head at seven trillion, eighteen thousand, four hundred twelve, seventy and a half million, thirty four kamillizon, point five miles per hour. “Good thing I always have spare eyeballs in my pocket,” said Bob.</p>
<p>After Bob replaced his eyes, he could see the man clearly for the first time. He looked for a few seconds and said nothing. Suddenly he leaped lightning-fast into the air, pulled out a machete, took a swing at the man’s neck, and missed!</p>
<p>He landed on the ground and said quietly, “Little Bo Peep, you’ve killed too many people for me to let you get away. Not just me, but others too. Like Forkleglooble. Do you know that he had a wife and six kids? They live in a cardboard box!” Bob’s voice was rising. “He was the only one in that family who brought in money, the only one who fed them, and you killed him!!!” Tears were streaming down Bob’s face as all the pent-up anger was being released.</p>
<p>“And his family isn’t the only one! What about the guy at the hotel!??! His wife died earlier, and now his daughter is parentless!!!!! And there’s more!!!!! When you murdered John F. Kennedy, his wife, his children, his aunts and uncles, his grandparents, his paper boy... All of them had to suffer pointlessly! AND BECAUSE OF YOU!!!!!” Bob was shouting in the man’s face and getting spit in it.</p>
<p>“And for God sake, take off that ridiculous mustache!” Bob furiously grabbed the man’s mustache, and ripped off his entire face, which was actually a mask. “Gimme my mask back, man!” said Elvis “Do you think I want people to know I’m alive?” Bob stared at him. “You... You’re not Little Bo Peep?” he asked. “Naw, she’s in New Zealand right now.” replied Elvis.</p>
<p>“Ah...” said Bob. “Well, I’ll just be going then...” He backed away slowly. <i>Wait a minute...</i> he thought. <i>Where am I anyway?</i> He asked Elvis, who said, “Why, don’t you know we’re in Saudi Arabia?”</p>
<p>Bob though for a minute. “How can I get to New Zealand quickly?” he asked Elvis. “Well, you can ride my jet” said Elvis. Bob’s face lit up. “Thanks. So where is it?” Elvis pointed to the teletubby house in the distance and said, “In there. Ya can’t miss it.” Bob ran to it, yelling his thanks.</p>
<p>Once inside the jet’s hiding place, he put on a pair of stupid looking flight goggles. The jet was shaped like a banana that swallowed a hippo. It had a magnificent green-and-brown polka dot pattern on it, and near the cockpit was a signed self-portrait of Chuck E. Cheese. Bob hopped inside, and revved up the engine.</p>
<p>It took off, spurted a giant cloud of liquid nitrogen, and then fell into South Africa. As it was falling, Bob turned around to see his parents behind him holding various reptiles. “OH MY GOD! THERE’S MY MOTHER WITH A SNAKE ON THIS PLANE!!!!” he screamed. Then his parents turned into sticks of celery and were destroyed along with Bob and the rest of the jet.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyBritish_d819.html" title="Edit section: CHAPTER 6">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHAPTER 6</span></h2>
<p>DO I REALLY NEED TO SAY IT? God turned around to Brahmin, who immediately said, “NO.” “Great, just great,” muttered God angrily. He thought for a few minutes, then took out his pager. He pressed the button labeled “Allah” on it. Nothing happened. He waited impatiently for a few minutes, then asked Brahmin, “Dost thou know where Allah is?”</p>
<p>Brahmin replied, “I think you guys are sorta the same dude.” “Curses!” said God. He took out his pager and then pressed “Yahweh”. When, once again, nothing happened, God turned slowly around and said to Brahmin, “Are Yahweh and I the same person, too?” Brahmin nodded his head at Allah.</p>
<p>“Curses!” said Yahweh. God then said, “Well, who’s going to resurrect Bob now?” Brahmin looked at Allah and shrugged. Yahweh yelled, “ARGH! Why does mine name keep changing within the narrative?!” “Who knows,” Brahmin said to God. God then said, “Oh good, it stopped.” He then snapped his fingers and said, “I know! I’ll use a dead religion’s god!”</p>
<p>“Whoopdee freakin’ doodle doo...” came from Brahmin. God pressed another button on his pager, and down on a cloud came Zeus. “Ah, Jupiter, mine old buddy, mine old pal!” began God. Zeus’s eyebrows narrowed. “My name’s Zeus.” God grinned a fake smile, and then said, “Yes, of course, Zeus! Now, could you do me a favor, and resurrect Bob?” Zeus smiled eagerly like a small child. “Oh boy, I haven’t had anything to do in over two thousand years!” he said while readying his lightning bolt of resurrection.</p>
<p>Down in South Africa, a baby cheetah was exploring for food. His mother had been taken by poachers earlier, and he was alone and unprotected. He raised his nose, and sniffed for food. In the distance he could smell a burning antelope. He slowly limped toward the smell, and found a wrecked plane. He waited until the fire burned out, then cautiously moved into it, following the smell of the antelope. As he was about to take a bite, a bolt of lightning struck, which instantly turned the antelope’s nose into blender. The cheetah cub died.</p>
<p>Then the rubble started moving. It shook, and then all flew away at... LUDICROUS SPEED! Where the rubble once was stood a single person. It was Bob, with cybernetic enhancements! He had cybernetic arms, cybernetic legs, and even cybernetic eyebrows! A helicopter propeller popped out of Bob’s head, and he flew all the way to New Zealand in seventeen seconds!</p>
<p>He landed and sent a bunch of smoke into the air, which caused thirty seven people in the nearby village to have asthma attacks and die. While Bob was bending over to tie his shoes, he felt a hard force go whammy into his shoulder. He turned around, and it was another cybernetically enhanced person!</p>
<p>Bob and his newfound enemy traded blows for about ten minutes, while a small child on the sidelines was shouting, “ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS!!!” at the top of his lungs. He turned around to his mother and looked up in to her face. Looking deep into her eyes, he asked with all the innocence of a child, “Mommy, why?” “Why what, dear?” “Why is there fighting? Why do people hurt each other?” His mother thought for a second and slowly replied, “Well, son... I... It’s like this.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth and spit out an amphibious grizzly bear, which had machine gun toenails that spit out M&amp;Ms at light speed and made the little boy have so many holes in him he looked like swiss cheese. He fell down with blood leaking from his body and dissolved into Kool-Aid mix.</p>
<p>Back to the fighting! Bob slammed his fist in the other guy’s nose, which shot out the back of his head! A black hole formed in the cavity of where the cyborg’s nose has previously been, which started sucking in everything around them, like grass, dirt, bushes, insects, and hot dog vendors. Bob’s cybernetic arm was also sucked inside the black hole. Suddenly, the nose hole turned into a mouth with razor sharp teeth, which cut his hand off!</p>
<p>Bob fell to the ground as he slowly bled, staining the grass brown, because red and green make brown. Seriously, try it yourself if you don’t believe me. The enemy cyborg pressed his belly button, and glowed bright pink. All of the metallic armor except for robotic contact lenses fell off, and standing before Bob was Little Bo Peep. She sneered cruelly and picked up Bob’s arm. Then she slammed it against the ground and watched it disintegrate.</p>
<p>She placed her foot on Bob’s chest and jabbed the heel of her shoe into him. “It’s time to finish off the job I never completed, you filthy cow!” she laughed maniacally. She then pulled out from her hair a curved, extremely pointy dagger. Little Bo Peep leaned close to Bob’s face and said, “I’m going to take this knife and grind it slowly and painfully in you until you can take no more! And then I will feed you baby food! Carrot flavored, in fact!”</p>
<p>Bob was grimacing from the pain of not having an arm, and spoke in shallow breaths. “Please... Why... What did I do to you?... Don’t... Stab...” His head went very dizzy as speaking became too difficult for him. Little Bo Peep moved the blade very close to Bob’s shoulder, an he braced himself for the pain. Just as she was about to stab him, she gave a grunt and went flying over Bob’s head.</p>
<p>Bob looked up to see Frank driving a tank. “What did I tell you, Bob? We’ll always be friends forever.” Bob weakly smiled and tried to get up. Frank said to him, “Here, let me help you. I just need to get outta this tank first.”</p>
<p>He looked at the control panel and saw a row of buttons. One was marked “battering ram”, which is what he had used on Little Bo Peep. Another was labeled “machine gun” and there was also “high-energy explosives”. There were also “heat up popcorn” and “defrost meat”. At the very end there were “fatal gas which will kill every living creature in the surrounding vicinity” and “eject”. “Ah, this looks good,” said Frank, spying the “fatal gas which will kill every living creature in the surrounding vicinity” button. He pressed it, then realized what a horrible mistake it was.</p>
<p>A gray gas slowly seeped out of the tank. Its noxious tendrils wound their ways into Bob and Frank’s lungs. Their eyes watered from pain, and Frank melted into yogurt. Bob rusted and stopped moving. Then he was run over by a passing Jeep. After that a bullet train came and ran over him. Then a whale ran over him too. Then a hurricane ran him over. Bob’s senses slowly dimmed, and then a fat jogger ran over him, which killed him.</p>

<p>OH BOY, RESURRECTION TIME. God and Brahmin were playing ping pong when God thought of something. “Hey, Brahmin. Now that we’ve got Zeus to resurrect Bob, why don’t we getteth him to do other things for us?” “Lke what?” asked Brahmin. “Well...” Zeus said, thinking. “He could do our grocery shopping, and laundry, and taxes, and stuff.” “Yeah, but we can materialize that junk outta thin air,” said Brahmin. “Look.”</p>
<p>He snapped his finger and the baby cheetah from chapter six appeared in a pile by their feet. Then with another snap, their was a live squid and a deisel truck. The truck slammed into the squid until it was a pile of pulp, then dissapeared. “See, cheetah chilli and squid applesauce.” God looked disappointed and hung his head. “Aw shucks, I always wanted a slave.” Brahmin went over to God and patted him on the back. “Hey, don’t be sad. I’m sure Zeus was busy with other stuff anyway.” God looked up and said, “Reallyeth?” Brahmin smiled and replied, “Yes, stuff like my laundry, not yours.”</p>
<p>Back on Earth, Zeus had tied one of Brahmin’s shirts around his neck like a cape. He painted the Superman triangle on it, except with a Z. “I AM ZEUSMAN!!!” he shouted fiercely. “NOW IT’S TIME TO SAVE PEOPLE!!! WITH MY TRUSTY...” he rummaged around in his pocket for a minute. “...GLUE STICK!!!!”</p>
<p>He flew over to the tank and spotted Bob’s arm. “Oh, that guy again. I MUST SAVE HIM!!!!” He swiftly pulled out his glue stick and speedily applied it all over Bob’s arm socket and glued the two parts of Bob together. He then summoned lightning bolts, which brought everybody back to life!</p>
<p>Frank got up and looked around. “Driew fo tros leef I...” he mumbled. “Og Peep Ob Elttil d’erehw!? Reh llik ot evah ew!” Bob shouted, rising to his feet. Zeus scratched his beard and said to himself, “I think something went wrong...” Bob angrily yelled to Zeus, “SDRAWKCAB gniklat er’ew taht tcaf eht s’ti ebyam, eeg!!!” “Ah yes, that must be it,” said Zeus to Bob. “Now, stand still and don’t move if you feel any pain.”</p>
<p>Zeus pulled out a hot iron and pressed it to Bob’s face. He ran it up and down with gusto, until the skull was fused to the skin. Then he took a pitchfork and cut a hole in Bob’s leg. He put it in and out vigorously as blood spattered everywhere. Zeus yelled over Bob’s screamings of pain, “This will fix your voice, I swear!” Bob replied to him, “ARRRRGHHGHGHEEEAAAGHUUURNKKKPOOPAEEEIAIIII!!!!!”</p>
<p>Bob then died an early death, making this chapter shorter than planned.</p>
