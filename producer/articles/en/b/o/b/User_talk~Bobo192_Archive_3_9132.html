<p>Hey Bobo! Someone's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cricket_9cf1.html#Chris_Taylor" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket">just found out</a> that you made two articles about the same guy, which obviously isn't ideal. Any idea on which should be where? I'd say the article should be at Chris (with a redirect from Christopher), I think he's usually called that even though CA insists on Christopher, but the article at Christopher is better. Thoughts? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> | <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Vimes_177e.html" title="User talk:Sam Vimes">Address me</a> 23:03, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening. Per the discussion about privacy concerns expressed at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Privacy_of_birthdays" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Privacy of birthdays</a>, date of birth should generally not be added to the biographies of living non-public or semi-public figures. So far, that policy has been interpreted fairly strictly with a pretty high bar being set for the definition of "public figures" who are assumed to have given up their rights to privacy.</p>
<p>By the same token, we should not be adding <a href="../../../d/a/t/Category%7EDate_of_birth_missing_4b5f.html" title="Category:Date of birth missing">Category:Date of birth missing</a> to articles unless we have made the case that the person meets the "public figures" threshold. Otherwise, we're just baiting new users into adding content even though the community has already said that we shouldn't include that particular data point. <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYear_of_birth_missing_f709.html" title="Category:Year of birth missing">Category:Year of birth missing</a> is okay but the exact date is often not. Thanks for your help. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The one I ran across was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Ryan_%28footballer%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90844405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Ryan_%28footballer%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90844405" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The recognition that we need to take extra precautions to protect the privacy of semi-public figures is fairly recent. But yes, it does represent a change in our intended standards.</dd>
<dd>So far, the definition of "public figure" has interpreted as people who are so famous that they are likely to have already taken extraordinary precautions to protect their own privacy. We're generally talking about people who have to hire bodyguards or extra staff whose job would include watching for identity theft against the principal - people the paparazzi chase. Bobby Ryan, on the other hand, looks like a reputable athlete but is unlikely to be employing dedicated people to protect his identity for him. Unless he's more famous than it appears from the article, we should probably not be including his exact birthdate on the article. And we should be using the "Year of birth missing" tag instead of the "Date of birth missing" tag. Thanks again. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:55, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bobo. There were two places which listed Steve Williams' details. Football Squads.co.uk (run by the RSSSF) has only recently added an Irish squads section, and has Shelbourne's squad <a href="http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/ireland/2006/prem/shelb.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/ireland/2006/prem/shelb.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Also, the DoB is on a different part of the official site that you linked to in external links. What seems to have happened is that your google search returned the "stats section" of the site - there is also a "Shels Penpics" under the squad section. See <a href="http://www.shelbournefc.ie/players.php" class="external text" title="http://www.shelbournefc.ie/players.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There was a brief mention of him in Dundalk's <a href="http://www.dundalkfc.com/History/1990S.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.dundalkfc.com/History/1990S.HTM" rel="nofollow">history section</a>, however I didn't see anything which confirmed when, or for how long, he was at Notts County. On loan maybe? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaledonian_Place_0f2d.html" title="User:Caledonian Place">Caledonian Place</a> 11:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that that you have deleted an article under CSD G1 that should not have been tagged that way. While the article is very possibly worthy of deletion under {{prod}} or AfD, I'm afraid in this case you have bitten a new user acting in very good faith to create a <i>sourced</i> article. Please take the time to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Shampoo_Effect" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Shampoo_Effect" rel="nofollow">the article</a> again, as well as the good-faith comment on the talk page.

<dd>hi there Nishkid64, yes I can perfectly understand the scepticism on whether <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristen_McMenamy_64e6.html" title="Kristen McMenamy">Kristen McMenamy</a> is a "notable personality" who meets CSD A7 criteria or not. I am new here on wikipedia and I understand that diligent administrators, like yourself, want to maintain the integrity of the database. I have done my best to describe Kristen's strong points, and you are welcome to cross check her references. You can check the "favourite model" citation from <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Meisel_8c1b.html" title="Steven Meisel">Steven Meisel</a>. McMenamy was a major player in the fashion world of the 1990s, and she has featured many times in Vogue. I have no personal relationship to her, and I am just interested in her contribution to the fashion world. The problem is, she is not a "household" name like Claudia Schiffer or Cindy Crawford, but that doesn't necessarily make her a nobody either. To be honest, I wish to expand and improve many articles for fashion personalities, but seeing my amendments constantly being reverted for no particular reason (such as SPAM) is very discouraging. All supermodels feature in advertisement campaigns, which can be viewed by looking at their external links (see <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudia_Schiffer_c6e0.html" title="Claudia Schiffer">Claudia Schiffer</a> who has featured in many advertisement campaigns). But these are usually historical adverts in a historical archive, and are not an attempt at spamming wikipedia or breaking copyright regulations.

<p>_ _ Hey, i'm as sentimental as the next guy! And time sure passes, doesn't it?<br />
_ _ As to what i wrote, sometimes i worry abt being <i>pretentiously</i> humble, but i think it's worth the risk -- especially after walking from the train station in <a href="../../../f/%C3%BC/s/F%C3%BCssen.html" title="Füssen">Füssen</a> to the foot of the big hill that <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuschwanstein.html" title="Neuschwanstein">Neuschwanstein</a> sits on (rather than waiting for the weekend local bus), and seeing Yanks just off their tour bus there, not being able to get into the pay toilet bcz they'd lost track of which country's currency was local there, and deciding they'd tour just dinky little <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenschwangau.html" title="Hohenschwangau">Hohenschwangau</a> since their bus wouldn't take them uphill to Ludwig's dream castle. I can't claim to be much of a citizen of the world in any dramatic way, but i guess it's worth caring about rising above the most glaring stupidities that seem typical of one's own nation. And as far as i can see, that's most needed (at least among the industrialized nations) where size, geographic isolation, income, war-winning, and brevity of national experience are combined. I estimate it's most significant in holding back madness in myself, but if something like posting that mini-essay turns out to succeed in welcoming a colleague, i'm very pleased.<br />

He is regarded by experts in the field as one of the top prospects for the NFL in the upcoming draft, see below.</li>

<p>"Greg Olsen, TE Miami Projected: Late 1st round, early 2nd round Good or bad move? While not a special talent, he has good hands and enough skills to be an exciting late first round pick. He's a good athlete who did the most he could with the shaky Miami quarterback play." from www.collegefootballnews.com.</p>
<p>Please unprotect this article. A similar player (probably less notable than Olsen) passed AfD in October.

<p>I am glad that the right decision was made by the community per Greg Olsen. However, a similar decision needs to be made for <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaal_Anderson_a594.html" title="Jamaal Anderson">Jamaal Anderson</a>, which you also SALT'ed. He has similar credentials as Greg Olsen, as he played at Arkansas, a major program and dominated at that level. Not only that, he is expected to be a first round pick like Olsen. I caution you not to delete pages about players that will most likely become high draft picks. These players are notable and deserve their own pages. In conclusion, please reinstate this article and any other college football player articles that you have also SALT'ed.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 16:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re this piece here:</p>
<p>Tillman resided at an assisted living center in East Hartford, Connecticut. Her death at age 114 years and 67 days around 10:10PM EST means that her title reign of just four days was the shortest ever, breaking the dubious distinction of 13 days held by Mitoyo Kawate of Japan. Her likely successor is Yone Minagawa, also of Japan.</p>
<p><br />
Please think for a moment. First, gaining the world's oldest person title but dying shortly thereafter can be considered a 'dubious distinction'...sort of like the ephemeral reign of a monarch. These people are held up as symbols of defying death. Dying right away, then, is metaphorically embarrassing, if not to themselves then at least to their image as 'world's oldest.'</p>
<p>Now, point two. In time, Nov 13 2003, Emma Tillman hadn't come along yet (so far as the records were concerned). Mitoyo, held up as Japan's example of longevity, died just 13 days after gaining the title...following Kamato Hongo's 18-month reign. Her title was, therefore, dubious.</p>
<p>Point three. In 2007, Emma Tillman's 4-day reign 'broke' the 'shortest title' record, meaning that Emma Tillman's "world's oldest person" title now bears the dubious distinction. After all, 'breaking the record' transfers the distinction from the previous recordholder to the current one. All of this is logical and should be inferred by the sentence as worded. Capiche?→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 02:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I suppose the new wording is more clinically correct, though now blanched of any judgment (which is, to some, a good thing). But if I were writing a book, I'd use 'dubious' distinction for two reasons:</p>
<p><a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:f5rXzvV6RT4J:www.thefreedictionary.com/dubious+dubious%2Bdefinition&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" class="external free" title="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:f5rXzvV6RT4J:www.thefreedictionary.com/dubious+dubious%2Bdefinition&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:f5rXzvV6RT4J:www.thefreedictionary.com/dubious+dubious%2Bdefinition&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us</a></p>
<p>ng or indicating lack of confidence or assurance;</p>
<p>subject to question</p>
<p>Obviously, if a titleholder held the title for only a week or two, their reign lacked in confidence or assurance. Also, the younger and shorter the title, the more subject to question it would be (it would be easier to find a 115-year-old that is real, than to find a real 123-year-old).</p>
<p>But one thing about Wikipedia is that it is the sum total of every contributor, not a personal work. Thus, I will go with your revision (although not your first version) as a compromise. The newer version is, ironically, less dubious in meaning than the old one.</p>

<p>Hi, Bobo192. Good work on reverting the vandalism to the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> article. However, before reverting an article, I recommend that you go back to make sure that the last version was not vandalized as well. In this case, two IP addresses vandalized the article and you only reverted the changes made by the last one. My system, which need not be yours, is to keep going back through the "diffs" until I find an edit by a member with a user page (a member whose name appears blue in the article history and in the diffs), because IP addresses and new users commit the vast majority of vandalism (unfortunately, not having a user page is currently the best indicator we currently have that a member is new). In addition, once the article is reverted, vandalism is much more likely to go undetected for long periods of time. If the vandalism is a deletion of a sentence or a paragraph, it may never be detected after a reversion. Actually, I examined the last 50 edits of the nuclear power article yesterday and found that 20 out of 25 of the last IP address edits were vandalism. Some of the edits were from the same person or source, so I also counted the number of unique vandals and found that 10 out of the last 13 IP address editors were vandals (assuming one editor per IP address). Also, three out of the last four editors with no user page were vandals. The one who was not a vandal had registered a while back, but the others were all making their first edits. These numbers have almost certainly changed somewhat since then because the article gets a ton of edits. This is a very small sample and nuclear power is a controversial subject, so the figures cannot be considered representative. Still, I think that they are in the ballpark for controversial articles. I would expect the average for all articles to be a bit lower. Thanks, <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
