<p>I thought this page would interest you as it is the prototype, if you will, for how the new Dad's Army episode pages might look.

<p>Bob,</p>
<p>Thank you for your GA review of the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Nielsen_a907.html" title="Leslie Nielsen">Leslie Nielsen</a> article. I actually agree with just about everything. I've not touched the article for a long time, and wrote all the sections up until those sections that you mentioned, when I sort of stopped editing the article (if you look at the peer review, I even admit those sections need work). I'm going to make an attempt to clean those sections up in the coming days, as I've been somewhat lazy and have been editing music related articles instead.</p>
<p>As for references, it's been difficult to locate non-Internet based articles on him (his "autobiography" is a work of fiction, for example), so I'll see what I can add there.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions and review. Hopefully, we'll have it up to GA quality in the coming week.</p>

<dd>I ask you to reconsider your vote. I have found an interesting twist to this whole thing. There is a Centralized Discussion about TV episode formats, which is how policies are adjusted and created. If you look again at the debate I have linked to the appropriate articles. This is not about preference, as we both know preference is an opinion and opinions are something else on Wikipedia. The articles detail that there are multiple formats for TV pages, and that season pages is one of them. It is no longer a question of who is right and wrong, but of who was there first. Selecting a format over another based on what you prefer is hardly NPOV. The season have been there for months longer than the list page, and they are complete (granted they need work to the tone of the article, but they are more complete than the list page) and technically have seniority over the list. Voted for the list, toward the deletion of the season pages, is promoting preference in Wikipedia. I ask you to read the Centralized Discussion page and think about what this debate is really about, now that other guidelines have been found. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a>
<dl>
<dd>That is what I meant about fixing them up (Which I am putting them in as we speak). They need the directors and writers of the episodes, after that the will be the exact same as the List of Episode pages, except they will have been created first. They only thing they are missing is writer and director. As for the individual episode pages (which the Centralized Discussion talks about) they are all already linked to their respective episodes in Wikia. You're voting to create a completely new page, that redundantly iterates what is said on a different format? A format that has been around 7 months longer than this one, and is accepted as part of the policy for TV shows? That doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a>
<dl>
<dd>I know that they are aiming for, and if the "List" format was first I would be fighting to keep that, but it wasn't. The season pages were first, and are merely a different format for the same job, except they keep the 100+ episode pages at bay, because they give a little more than 1 sentence summaries for the episode. I've gone through and added the *<b>Written By:</b> *<b>Directed By:</b> to all the seasons, they just need to be filled in. My understanding is that it isn't helpful to Wikipedia to have redundant pages, and that it is their belief that once they finish the List page they will merge the season pages (i.e. delete). I know they plan on deleting them because one of them already attempted to redirect the Season 1 page, after he completed the episode pages for Season 1 on the List's article. I'm curious as how this is "fair" in regards to pages that have been around longer, of different format (but accepted format), carrying same information as other pages? How is it that they automatically get the right to delete pages that have been in existence longer and carry the same things they are reiterating on their page? That's preference for a format. You're saying that if I find an acceptable format for another article, I can rewrite that entire article in another format, delete and redirect the original article, all because I like my format better. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 18:41, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Ah, yes, but once they finish creating a page for every single episode (even though policy states that not every episode is deserving of it's own page) they are going to call for a merge of the season page. As I said <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> has already attempted to delete and redirect Season 1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smallville_%28season_1%29&amp;diff=72158371&amp;oldid=71883118" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smallville_%28season_1%29&amp;diff=72158371&amp;oldid=71883118" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smallville_%28season_1%29&amp;diff=72158371&amp;oldid=71883118</a>. I'm sure they plan on deleting and redirecting every Season, completely disregarding anything anyone says. I mean, <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">ArmedBlowfish</a> stated that episode pages should not be created until the Season articles are well referenced, but Peregrinefisher went ahead and created a page for every episode in Season 1. I'm pretty sure there's a lack of respect going on here. The fact remains that List of Episodes, Episode Pages, and Season Pages all carry the same information, just each one has a different level of how much detail. Look at it like this, the "List" page contains everything that is already in the Season page and the Main article page, there is no difference in that information, it's only in List form. Making an article just to list what is already stated in the main article and the season page is kind of irrelevant. That could easily be merged to the main article page, where you just list every episode title/number/airdate, while the summaries could be left to the season pages. Or, I could see a page with nothing but the title/number/airdate and a link to "See descripions of Seasons and Episodes". That would be different than a page containing the same info with just a few sentences short of what is already being used. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></dd>
<dd>I wish you would see that Talk page for "list of episodes". Pere requested a vote to determine if the indy ep pages should be created (which I thought was clear on the other page), in the mean time he has gone ahead and created Season 2 pages and plans to go ahead with others, completely ignoring everyone. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></dd>

<p>Hello! Regarding the revert, no harm done! However, you've raised an interesting question as to whether the list should actually be in broadcast order. If it threw someone with a high level of editorial competence such as yourself (sincere comment), is the current order liable to confuse everyone else reading the article? ~~ <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">Peteb16</a> 13:09, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have an interest - note I have created a Category:Gerry Anderson to bring together all the related items that don't have their own categories - thus the existing Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet categories can be sub-categories of this one. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 00:49, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. The thing, though, is that the Gerry Anderson things have a connection - but not all are science fiction (The Protectors clearly isn't, Four Feather Falls feature magic feathers - so I guess it counts fantasy). The individuals shows should probably be in that category - Thunderbirds already is, and I will add the others with their own categories. But I am not sure about the GA category itself. Is Gerry a franchise&#160;? -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 17:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the quick response of reviewing and passing the Drew Carey article. After completing this one and the Samuel L.
