<p>This Wikipedia article treats the history of Boba Fett from fictonal material actually accumulated over time in popular culture. Wouldn't it be more consistent in a REFERENCE work, such as Wikipedia, to speak of the development of the character in culture? I understand the details of the chacracter are now important to many people, however, as a work of reference perhaps Wikipedia should treat these fans' details as secondary to the actual development of Boba Fett, first as a merchandized toy (I believe), then as a small role played in Empire Strikes Back. These facts are REAL whereas his birth in 32 BBY (whatever that means) is only fictionally accurate.</p>
<p>Is there a general Wikipedia guide to distinguishing truth and fictional truth?</p>
<p>I value Wikipedia to distinguish fact and fiction.</p>

<dd><i>born c. 32 BBY</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>32 BBY is not an approximation, it is the year Fett was born.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, books and comics predating</i> Attack of the Clones<i>, considered by many to be canon, state that Boba Fett was not a clone, nor was he born on Kamino. According to these sources, Fett was born Jaster Mareel on the planet of Concord Dawn. He was apparently exiled at age sixteen for killing a superior officer in the Protector's Guild. After his exile, he adopted the name Boba Fett and "bows to no one.". These aspects of his past have been extensively <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> since the release of</i> Attack of the Clones <i>(see below).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Both correct and incorrect information here. I've weeded out the bad and elaborated on the good.</p>

<dd><i>He was believed to be briefly under the custody of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Grievous_6859.html" title="General Grievous">General Grievous</a>, who was a friend of his father.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is false information.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is unknown at this point whether or not Lucas actually filmed the scene for the DVD before deciding not to include it, or if he has or will film the scene for a future release of his films. Because of Fett's rather high popularity in the fan community, and the fact that Lucas has shown interest in using the character of Boba Fett for the upcoming</i> Star Wars <i>live-action series, it is possible that Lucas may indeed wish to include this scene in a future release of the films, to cater to the fans, and to cash in on Fett's popularity.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The speculative nature of this paragraph makes its presence in the article unnecessary; there is no evidence to suggest it is even possible Fett's escape was ever filmed, and none to suggest that Lucas, having already considered adding such a scene but ultimately deciding not to, will change his mind in the future.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>(The only being on record to survive such an encounter)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Untrue.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>All the stories that contradict his origins as seen in</i> Attack of the Clones <i>are seen as simply alternate stories, spread by Fett and others, with the intent to hide his true origins and past.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>. . . <i>already making modifications to both the</i> Slave I <i>and the Mandalorian armor inherited from his father.</i></dd>

<p>Boba inherited both Jango's armor and Jaster Mereel's armor, as explicitly stated in <i>The New Essential Guide to Characters</i>.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Scream - Noted the "Wilhelm" in the Sarlacc scene in the RotJ section... it's also in the "Portrayers" section, but the ESB section had the various quotes and cited a total of four in the original trilogy, so seemed relevant to add a line to the RotJ as well. I was pondering editing this to five, but "Aaaaargh!" is arguable as a line, hence the designation being in quote marks. I've read varying reports of it being counted as a fifth line or not, notably in the official collector's magazine. It's definately a fifth utterance, though. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavedriver_9832.html" title="User:Slavedriver">Slavedriver</a> 11:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Check the picture in the Boba Fett page - there's Boba Fett and an Imperial stormtrooper behind him. Now think about it: those two will basically look like exactly the same under their armor. They both are just clones of some guy named Jango Fett. Thank you, George Lucas, for ruining Boba Fett's mystery!</p>

<dd>Eventually the Empire started using clones of other men, creating more diversity among clones. While Jango's DNA continues to be used, there are various other "types" of clones.</dd>

<p>Where can I find this "stormtroopers are clones" official confirmation? It will be valuable for me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You will not find that anywhere because it is not so, if it was then Han Solo is also a clone of Jango (since he was in the imperial navy and started as a stormtrooper). Also all the imperial officers should be clones then, since they at some point must have been stormtroopers. --Sneaking Viper 05:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Navy&#160;!= Army. He was never a stormtrooper, either.

<dd>And you also stated that he "started as a stormtrooper" - an Army thing. And similarly "Also all the imperial officers should be clones then, since they at some point must have been stormtroopers"- what is up with that? And as for Veers, why would he be a clone? Just because the initial Grand Army of the Republic were clones, why does that imply that ~20 years later, all Army personnel were clones? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 04:13, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So in your mind officers start in in Navy, Army whatever as a officer, you state "He was a lieutenant in the Imperial Starfleet" like he started in that rank?? And i thank you for agreeing with me on that Stormtroopers are not clone, as you say, "why does that imply that ~20 years later, all Army personnel were clones?" indeed why, when they have millions of planets to recruit from. And as a final note on this, if all stormtroopers are clones, why need training facilities? the Kaminoes didnt, Carida's training facility shouldnt really be needed, if they are cloned as the clone troopers were. --Sneaking Viper 00:19, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But searching through Star Wars material, it indeed seems we are both right. Carida (and other training academies) were in the beginning made for training non cloned officers and non commision officers in the 3 branches of the imperial forces (Army, Navy and Stormtrooper (please note that stormtroopers are not under the army command, they are a branch for them self)), later (however no specific time could be found) it was expanded to train standard troops, naval troops and storm troopers when the Empire stopped cloning Stormtroopers. the time period is never specified however Carida was destroyed 10 ABY (After Battle of Yavin) so it must have been long before that. --61.214.132.192 01:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Were stormtroopers a separate branch? I never really was too sure about that, since I kept coming across statements to the effect that stormtroopers were the cream of the crop of army troopers (and the cream of the stormtroopers were selected for Royal Guard duties, and the best of the Royal Guard selected for Soveriegn status, and the best of the Sovereigns were to become Dark Jedi.... at the time I was researching Star Wars hierarchies), which sorta implied that stormtroopers were a subsection of the army. But really, is it so hard to accept that initially all stormtroopers were clones, and as time wore on, increasing proportions of the militaries were manned by non-clones? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 02:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>from what i have read, the stormtrooper corps were not unlike the marine corps we have in america, they are their own branch but work through the navy, with most of their support units being naval(e.g. medics, things of that nature). could be wrong through, and if so then i stand corrected.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManwithbrisk_2534.html" title="User:Manwithbrisk">Manwithbrisk</a> 19:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not to put too nerdy a point on it, but that's a bad counter-example. Luke's a Jedi Master, who can draw upon the awesome power and strength of the Force, so age means less to him than others (remember Yoda? In only 20 years he went from a whirling dervish of lightsaber destruction to a doddering corpse- do you really think he aged that much? No; he simply stopped drawing so heavily on the Force, and his 900 years caught up with him.); ditto for Leia. Plus they are not in the same paranoid, strenuous, physically demanding profession Fett is. Nor does Fett have any little improvements tucked away, gift o' the Kaminoans. So, a lifetime spent battling and nearly dying, and all sorts of insults to the flesh, plus another 20 or so years, a few weeks or months in the Sarlacc, with no Force or special talents to prop him up, with every wannabe badass in the galaxy trying to kill him left and right (as well as certified badasses like IG-88 or Darth Vader)... I'm thinking Fett should either be A) Dead, or B) retired. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> 18:15, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In "The Last one Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett" by Daniel Keys Moran in the compilation "Tales of the Bounty Hunters" it is revealed that in about 26 ABY Fett is still bounty hunting, and that he captures The Butcher of Montellian Serat. It is also revealed that he runs into Han Solo a second time on Jubilar, attempting to kill him, but this conflict ends in a draw that both men walk away from. I'm wondering if this is considered a canon EU source or not. It doesn't seem to conflict with the movies at all. If it is canon, then perhaps information from it should be added to the article, such as what I put above. I'll add the info myself, but I want someone to tell me if it's canon first. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Sephiroth_116b.html" title="User:Lord Sephiroth">Lord Sephiroth</a> 01:08, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The quotes section of this page really needs to be cleaned up—especially the formatting. I've tried to format this section better, but for some unknown reason, my edits keep getting reverted to an inconsistent and less readable form. I also think a lot (maybe even all) of the quotes should be moved to Wikiquote, and a link to the appropriate Wikiquote page should be provided. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 01:05, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On most articles, I would agree, but, this is Fett, he did not speak very many lines, so that makes them notable in this article, and doesn't need another article for the quotes. As for the formatting, I was trying to make them in the same format as that for other star wars character articles, for example: <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 01:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>A while ago, I made a couple <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetics.html" title="Aesthetics">aesthetic</a> improvements to the page that I felt greatly enhanced both the look and readability of the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> article. Both improvements were quickly reverted with little comment. However, I feel that they improved the page and would ask that other contributors submit an agreement or disagreement. The changes were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The addition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boba_Fett&amp;oldid=24690116#Expanded_Universe" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boba_Fett&amp;oldid=24690116#Expanded_Universe" rel="nofollow">headers for subsections</a> in the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html#Expanded_Universe" title="Boba Fett">Expanded Universe</a> section:</b> Right now, the page uses very non-standard and inconsistent Wiki formatting. The section is very long and, in my opinion, warrants subheaders. Right now, the "subheaders" are a simple bulleted point; however the rest of the content is not bulleted. Either the entire section should consist of bulleted points (which, in my opinion, would be ugly), or they should have subheaders to increase readability <i>and</i> navigability.</li>
<li><b>Quotations format</b>. I had edited the format of the quotes to look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boba_Fett&amp;oldid=24594800#Quotes_of_Boba_Fett" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boba_Fett&amp;oldid=24594800#Quotes_of_Boba_Fett" rel="nofollow">this</a>; however, my edits were reverted for some reason. Now the quotes lack consistency and readability, as well as having improperly-used semicolons thrown into the middle of them. I see nothing wrong with my quote formatting, and think that it enchances the page. If nothing else, the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html#Quotes_of_Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Quotes section</a> needs to be cleaned up, or ported entirely over to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org" rel="nofollow">Wikiquote</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had considered putting a {{cleanup-date}} on the front page to resolve this issue, but I think it can do without (for now; if this request does not get enough attention, I'll put it on for a while). I also didn't want to simply unilaterally reinstate my edits because I see no need for a <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">childish edit war</a>.</p>

<p>"It is of interest to note that, though Fett's Sarlacc escape is official and did "happen" in the Star Wars canon, had Lucas inserted that particular scene into the movie, it would have made Fett's escape part of the highest level of canon, which is G-canon. Arguably, this is still the case, as Lucas's comments imply it happened in the film, simply off-screen."</p>
<p>Isn't this kind of like a fan's hoping wish that Boba Fett surviving the sarlac is canon? Last I checked, if something is in the movie, it's canon, if it's not, it's not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, his survival still is canon, as it is depicted in the later novels and comics. But you are referring to G-canon, I believe. No, it is not fan wises in particular.

<p>From Protrayls: "...The stormtroopers in Episodes IV-VI are not all clones of Boba's father, Jango, as revealed in Battlefront II. [should end here] <i>Though this has been established in Star Wars continuity, Lucas still has the ability to change this in a newer release of his films. He still may dub Morrison's voice over the stormtroopers in the original films.</i>"</p>
<p>I don't think this <i>potentially</i> snarky slight to Lucas' nature of changing his films is necessary. Of course he could change it; that goes without saying. You could add that line after every sentence on any article. For example, "Luke and Leia are siblings. Though this has been established in Star Wars continuity, Lucas still has the ability to change this in a newer release of his films." Of course he could! He could add a British Tauntaun driving a Sandcrawler through the clouds of Bespin if he wanted. More importantly, it's pure conjecture to say that Lucas is even considering using Morrison's voice for the Stormtroopers in another future version. Where's the cite for the interview he said it in? I'm all for including it <i>if</i> it's true.</p>
<p>"...The reason behind the controversial move of replacing the voice of Wingreen is that as a clone of Jango, Boba should sound like him as well [should end here] <i>(although this makes little logical sense, since an individual's way of speaking is shaped - and constantly changed - by the voices they hear around them).</i>" Is that unanimously accepted in science? Even if it is, why is that personal editorial remark needed for this aticle? As soon as you mention something like that, you have to cite its truthfullness for other readers.
