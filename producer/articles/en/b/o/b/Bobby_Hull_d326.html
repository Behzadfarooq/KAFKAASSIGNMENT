<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hull_d326.html" title="Edit section: NHL career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NHL career</span></h2>
<p>Hull quickly blossomed into a star, finishing second in the rookie of the year balloting his first season. Hull originally wore numbers 16 and 7 as a Blackhawk but would later switch to his famous number 9, a tribute to his childhood idol <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordie_Howe_0dc3.html" title="Gordie Howe">Gordie Howe</a>. By his third season, he led the league in goal- and point-scoring. Nicknamed the "<i>Golden Jet</i>", he went on to lead the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Blackhawks_a40d.html" title="Chicago Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960-61_NHL_season_da7f.html" title="1960-61 NHL season">1961</a> — their third (and most recent) overall and first in 23 years. Hull was famous for his blinding speed and possessed the most feared slapshot of his day. He and teammate <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Mikita_4d1a.html" title="Stan Mikita">Stan Mikita</a> were the most formidable forward duo of the Sixties, notorious for curving the blades of their sticks. Armed already with a blazing, heavy shot, his curved blade caused the puck to veer high and at all different angles. Hull's ability to harness the blade's unpredictability would make it one of hockey's most memorable signatures.</p>
<p>Although he was only 5'10" in stature, Bobby had a solid build and his playing weight was 185 pounds. His flowing blonde hair, good looks and electrifying style would make him one of hockey's first international superstars and arguably the NHL's marquee star of the Sixties.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, he became the first <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">NHLer</a> to score more than 50 goals in a season, surpassing <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Richard_8908.html" title="Maurice Richard">Maurice Richard</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Geoffrion_495f.html" title="Bernie Geoffrion">Bernie Geoffrion</a>'s hallowed mark of 50 goals. His 51st goal against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Rangers_3878.html" title="New York Rangers">New York Rangers</a> earned him a seven-minute standing ovation from the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Stadium_4cf2.html" title="Chicago Stadium">Chicago Stadium</a> faithful. He would go on to score 54 goals that season, the highest single season total of the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Six_43ce.html" title="Original Six">Original Six</a> era, and led the league in goal scoring seven times in all in the Sixties. Despite Hull breaking his own record by four goals in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968-69_NHL_season_75a7.html" title="1968-69 NHL season">1968-69</a>, the Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since his rookie season. By his final <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971-72_NHL_season_e58a.html" title="1971-72 NHL season">NHL season</a>, he had scored 50 goals or more a remarkable five times, only one fewer than every other player in history who had done so combined to that date.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hull_d326.html" title="Edit section: WHA career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">WHA career</span></h2>
<p>Long unhappy because of his relatively poor salary in the period when he was hockey's preeminent superstar, Hull responded to overtures from the upstart <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hockey_Association_fb62.html" title="World Hockey Association">World Hockey Association</a>'s <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Jets_a34d.html" title="Winnipeg Jets">Winnipeg Jets</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972-73_WHA_season_dd8b.html" title="1972-73 WHA season">1972</a> by jesting that he'd jump to them for a million dollars, a sum then considered absurd. Gathering the other league owners together to contribute to the unprecedented amount on the grounds that inking such a major star would give instant credibility to the new rival league that was competing directly against the entrenched NHL, Jets' owner Ben Hatskin agreed to the sum, and signed Hull for a contract worth $1,000,000 over ten years. Although his debut with Winnipeg was held up in litigation by the NHL, Hull instantly became the WHA's greatest star, and with Swedish linemates <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anders_Hedberg_f50b.html" title="Anders Hedberg">Anders Hedberg</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/f/Ulf_Nilsson_a28d.html" title="Ulf Nilsson">Ulf Nilsson</a> formed one of the most formidable forward lines of the 1970s (known as "The Hot Line"), leading the Jets to two <a href="../../../a/v/c/Avco_World_Trophy_34a7.html" title="Avco World Trophy">AVCO Cups</a> during his time with the club. His best year was <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974-75_WHA_season_fcfc.html" title="1974-75 WHA season">1975</a>, when he scored 77 goals to set a new professional mark.</p>
<p>Because he joined the rival league, Hull was not allowed to represent <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Canada_70cf.html" title="Team Canada">Team Canada</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_Summit_Series_f0e5.html" title="1972 Summit Series">1972 Summit Series</a>. However in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974-75_WHA_season_fcfc.html" title="1974-75 WHA season">1974</a> he got his chance to play on the international stage when he suited up for the <a href="../../../w/h/a/WHA_75c5.html" title="WHA">WHA</a> team representing Canada in a series against the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a> national team. The WHA lost the series four games to one (three ending in a tie), despite Hull's seven goals. He was a key member of the Canadian squad that won the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Cup_92cb.html" title="Canada Cup">Canada Cup</a>, though, scoring five goals in seven games.</p>

<p>Slowed by injuries and age, Hull played only a few games in the WHA's final season of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978-79_WHA_season_adf1.html" title="1978-79 WHA season">1979</a>. However, after the 1979 merger of the two leagues (including the Jets) and reportedly in financial straits, Hull came out of retirement to play once more for the NHL Jets. He played in eighteen games before being traded to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartford_Whalers_f6a5.html" title="Hartford Whalers">Hartford Whalers</a> for future considerations, and played effectively in nine games and three playoff games before retiring once more to care for his partner who had recently been injured in an automobile accident.</p>
<p>Hull ended his career having played in 1063 NHL games, accumulating 610 goals, 560 assists, 1170 points, 640 penalty minutes, three <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Ross_Trophy_6ac1.html" title="Art Ross Trophy">Art Ross Trophies</a>, two <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart_Memorial_Trophy_7de9.html" title="Hart Memorial Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophies</a>, a <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Byng_Memorial_Trophy_6f2c.html" title="Lady Byng Memorial Trophy">Lady Byng Memorial Trophy</a>, a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> Championship and adding 102 penalty minutes, 62 goals and 67 assists for 129 points in 119 playoff games. He played in 411 WHA games, scoring 303 goals, 335 assists and 638 points, adding 43 goals and 37 assists in 60 playoff games — 80 points.</p>
<p>In 1978 he was made an Officer of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Canada_843d.html" title="Order of Canada">Order of Canada</a>. In 1983, Hull was inducted into the <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame_1a24.html" title="Hockey Hall of Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>. His #9 jersey has been retired both by the Blackhawks and the Jets (and is still honored by the Jets' successor team, the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Coyotes_ccc2.html" title="Phoenix Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a>.)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_sports.html" title="1998 in sports">1998</a>, Hull got involved in a controversy with the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> media when he allegedly made pro-<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> comments. He later claimed the interviewer misunderstood him in the translation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hull_d326.html" title="Edit section: The Hull family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Hull family</span></h2>
<p>Bobby's younger brother <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Hull_6d6d.html" title="Dennis Hull">Dennis</a> (sometimes referred to as "<i>the Silver Jet</i>"), starred alongside him with the Chicago Blackhawks for eight seasons, scoring over 300 goals in his own right. When Bobby was excluded from the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_Summit_Series_f0e5.html" title="1972 Summit Series">1972 Summit Series</a> because he played in the WHA, Dennis initially planned to boycott the event as well as a show of support for his brother, but Bobby persuaded him to stay on Team Canada.</p>
<p>Bobby's son, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Hull_4913.html" title="Brett Hull">Brett Hull</a> (the "<i>Golden Brett</i>"), was a more glittering star yet, finishing his own illustrious career with the third-highest goal total in NHL history. Bobby and Brett are the only father-and-son tandem to achieve the marks of more than 50 goals in a season and more than 600 NHL goals. They are also the only father-and-son tandem to win the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart_Trophy_a49d.html" title="Hart Trophy">Hart Trophy</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Byng_Trophy_46dc.html" title="Lady Byng Trophy">Lady Byng Trophy</a>.
