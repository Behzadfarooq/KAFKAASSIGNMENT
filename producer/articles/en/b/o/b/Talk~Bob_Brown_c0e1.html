<p>The notion that Bob is Anti American is an entirely contested concept. Like much of the Australian population Bob has NOT expressed anti american sentiments, but rather sentiments oposing the behaviour of the US administration. The ideas are quite different, and key to understanding the conceptual modalities of the 'left' ideologies.</p>
<p>Feel free to adapt the text to reflect your conceptual modalities. If I disagree I will conceptually modalify it back again.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:12, 29 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>*rolls eyes* Yes, it's necessary. As a queer woman myself, it's nice to be able to see the successes achieved by other queer people, and quite inspiring at that. Thus, the category system is useful for navigating with such things. Anyway, if you disagree with the category: go take it up on the category page itself, and not here.

<p>A minor change, I think. Bob was the "unoffical" leader of the Greens because they did not have enough seats to qualify. Now, with the smaller parliament they do, and Peg Putt is the leader. see <a href="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/GreensCab.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/GreensCab.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/GreensCab.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MP_State_Federal.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MP_State_Federal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MP_State_Federal.htm</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Nyet. Peg Putt was the Greens leader when she was the only remaining member left in the Assembly. Brown was the unofficial leader of the Greens firstly because they didn't exist as a party at that time (five "independent Greens" were elected in 1989, who later formed the Tasmanian Greens); he then became leader when the party decided to have one. For the same reason, the federal party doesn't have a leader because the membership have not agreed to it - something which I'm told they're currently consulting about changing. Number of seats held has nothing to do with it. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 23:48, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nyet, Nyet! Number of seats held has everything to do with it. You don't get a "Party Leader" without having Party Status, and the Greens do not qualify as a parliamentry party in any jurisdiction except Tasmania, where they have only qualified since the size of the Parliament was reduced from 35 to 25 (I believe this is correct, but I have no reference for it - corrections appriecated). Federally, the requirement is five members. The Greens currently have four, and so do not qualify as a parliamentry party. Likewise, the Australian Democrats now only have four members and no longer have a Party Leader.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your history of the party in the Tasmanian Parliament is a little off as well. Brown was first elected in the seat of Denison in 1983 as an independent. At the next election in 1986, he was re-elected as a Green and joined by 1986 Gerad Bates (Franklin). Christine Milne (Lyons) Lance Armstrong (Bass) and Diane Hollister (Braddon) arrived at the 1989 election to bring the total to five. Browse <a href="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MHAs_since_1909.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MHAs_since_1909.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/datasheets/MHAs_since_1909.htm</a> for confirmation - Brown is listed as "IND/GREEN" everyone who follows is simply "GREEN". This indicates that the Tasmanian Greens were registered sometime between 1983 and 1986. The fact that the party was registered does not imply they they had party status in the Parliament.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, you're almost half right about what the party's 'proposed' changes are. The "changes" are not to create the position of leader, but to formalise the establishment of a Party Room and confirm that the elected representatives have the authority to appoint the Party Leader, the Party Whip, allocate portfolios and other procedural matters. (I can't proved an online reference for this, but I got the notification about this in the mail yesterday.)</dd>

<dd>Ultimately, this is a minor point, but I have provided authorative references to support my edit which have not been rebutted and I have shown that Ambi's justification for reversion contains factual errors.

<dd>I may have been off on some of the details, but you're still completely off on the actual point. The Greens have leaders in some states, but do not in others - official parliamentary party status has nothing to do with it. You appear to be forgetting that Peg Putt became leader when she was the only MHA - by your logic, they would have been leaderless after the 1998 election. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:02, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Party status" in Canberra is a discretion granted by the Government. I don't believe there is a fixed protocol in place for according it. Howard gave it to the Democrats because he wanted to. He is not likely to give it to the Greens, whether they have four, five or more members. Irrespective of this, any party can designate their own leader - as demonstrated by Family First giving Stephen Fielding leadership status - even though he is leading only himself. The Greens have recently confirmed the process for electing the parliamentary leader, and have exercised the process to select one (Bob Brown). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 10:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im supposing my alterations won't stand, knowing how precious many Green party supporters are. I deleted 2 references to Brown's sexuality becuase it is irrelevant. Its already mentioned twice, and thats enough. He never stood as a homosexual campainger, and in his time in the Tasmania parliament it was never an issue. By littering the reference to what his sexual inclination is 4 times takes away from why and what being a Green is, and his broader stance on things. The article is, in my opinion, does him no justice at all. Whoever wrote it is probably gay themselves, as has used their issue to hijack the full story of Browns acheivments. I made reference to what Gunns is. Not everyone knows. Brown also no longer lives in Hobart, but I see that clarrification didnt stand either.</p>

<dd>Censorship doesn't stand? It does so if I have made sensible suggestions for change, but they are reverted back to what they were! Ignoring the many homosexual references for a minute, I thought clarrifying what Gunns is, and correcting the fact Brown doesn't live in Hobart anymore was a sensible addition. Obviously not hey!

<p>What you said there didn't make any sense. Do you mean clarify them without my political bias? I did, but you ignored them and wiped out my changes. I have no bias, I am actually a member of the Greens. I won't be attempting to make any further changes but I hope you'll take my opinions on board and maybe do them yourself. I'm sure potential Green voters come to look up at Brown on wikipedia and walk away with the view that his main claim to fame is being a homosexual crusader. Wrong. Not a representative view of who is, or what he stands for. Lastly, change the Hobart residence bit at the end if you want to be accurate. He lives with his partner 50km away now. I also think referring to the fact he will be 69, if he wins his Senate seat at the next election, and if he serves that full term, is irrelevant. Thats all I got to say. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 61.68.169.56 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.68.169.56_a136.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.68.169.56">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I made a final comment here 4 days ago but it looks like it has been censored. Why censor my opinions? I have a problem with many Greens restricting the freedom of speech of others. They tend to be that way. What I will again say, in the interest of others, is there is no point in me altering anything, even carefully, because the changes and efforts I make will be reverted back again. I pointed out the big flaws in the article. Fix them if you will Ambi, and please leave this comment in this time without censoring me yet again!

<p>Where is the reference that supports "In federal Parliament, however, he became more active on this issue, particularly when a second gay . . . "? Brown has not campaigned on gay issues/rights as far as I know. Michael Organ (Greens, Cunningham) spoke in Parliament on same sex marriage, and campaigned on that issue, not Brown. The phrase "During his parliamentary career in Tasmania, Brown was not particularly outspoken on gay rights issues, although he never concealed the fact that he was gay." is out of place - it should be back with his Tasmanian parliamentary service section. Also , the "never concealed" bit is entirely redundant as it is previously stated that he had "publicly come out". I am considering making some edits to sort this out. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 10:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the statement "he would be 69 by the end of his third term" because I suggested it was not neutral point of view.

<dd>I say lose the age reference. Who cares how old he'll be in 2310? It's not like he's breaking any records or anything. I don't see what it adds to the article. --<a href="../../../j/g/r/User%7EJgritz_6f2d.html" title="User:Jgritz">Jgritz</a> 10:16, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It makes clear, for starters, that his next term will almost certainly be his last - indeed, many commentators I read thought that he would retire as early as 2007. I really don't see why this presents an image of weakness on Brown's part, as he's still as active as he was twenty years ago. I think this is being just the slightest bit overzealous. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And he'd be 75 at the end of a fourth term. So? Even Johnny Howard's got 5 years on Bob. The average age of a legislative council member in Tasmaina is about 165, so it's nothing new down here.

<dd>Looking back in the history I see it was first included in the context of speculation whether he would run again, especially given his age. He has announced his intention to run again so there isn't the same need to include a reference to his age which is a remnant from the speculation. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 10:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, there is, really, as he's very unlikely to run for another term after this one - it's relevant that he's getting on (heck, if he were in the Labor Party, he'd be forced to retire as he'd be past compulsory retirement age). Personally, I hope he hangs around for as long as he can, but that doesn't make his age any less relevant. I really think you're reading too much into this. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I checked <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>'s page to compare mentions of his age. The last mention of Howards age I can see is "scored a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections over Keating to become Prime Minister of Australia at the age of 56". And there is no mention under the heading "For as long as the party wants me" where his age would be a relevant factor. On Kim Beasley's article, there is no mention of his age, but "By October 2005 he had spent 25 years in the House of Representatives and become the equal fourth longest-serving current member of the House" is mentioned. I agree that the focus on Brown's age is not really appropriate and should be removed. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 11:40, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont think that the information "and became recognised as the national leader of the anti-war left." is either accurate or NPOV. I think this part of the sentence should be deleted. Who is the "anti war left"? (no reference is provided). I am not aware of any such group that would regard Brown as their national leader.

<dd>Technically, Brown was the first Green MP - he was elected as an independent Green, whereas Sanders was elected as a Democrat.

<dd>Maybe, instead of referring to him as the first Green, you could refer to him as the longest-serving Green MP. He served 10 years in the Tasmanian Parliament, which only ranks behind Peg Putt, Jim Scott and Ian Cohen for longest term, and once you include his 10 years in the Senate (still counting), he is by far the longest, outstripping his successor in Denison, Peg Putt, who is second with almost 13 years. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Braue</a> 03:48, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for not clarifying on this earlier (thought it was fairly self explanatory), but I disagree with the opening "Despite his rather dour and humourless public manner, he is widely admired as a man of courage and conviction, even by those who disagree with him. One example of Brown at his most tolerant (as well as an indication of a dry sense of humour) is his welcoming of Fred Nile's intention to run as a Christian Democratic Party of Australia candidate for the Australian Senate in the 2004 federal election. Brown was quoted as saying "He will give the opportunity to highlight the Greens' humanitarian policies which have doubled the vote for the Greens in the last three or four years." Unless this is cited/cleaned up, I don't believe it should be in the article.</p>
