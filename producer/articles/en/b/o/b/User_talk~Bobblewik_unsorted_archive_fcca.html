<p>what is this "units possibly using google converter" i keep seeing? you should make the edit summary a link to a short description. keep in mind that google converter is wrong sometimes, notably with calculations involving <a href="../../../k/b/p/Kbps.html" title="Kbps">kbps</a>. convert with care. - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 13:58, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you can see, I do a *lot* of conversions rapidly. I do try to take account of the many constraints that people request but it is impossible to comply with all of them. In general, think that I do convert with care. However, there is always room for improvement so I am keen to here more. I don't understand what you mean by a 'link'. Are you suggesting that I put a web page in there?</dd>

<dd>No, I mean write up a little thing on your user page and then enter your edit summary as [[User:Bobblewick#Conversions|units, possibly using Google converter]], like I do for [[User:Omegatron#Spell_checker|Spell checker]] - using US English - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a></dd>

<dd>I am editing pages at an extremely fast pace and it is easier to use an identical summary. I thought that you were suggesting different summaries for each page but it is clear that you aren't. Know that I understand it, your suggestion is an excellent idea. I will do it.

For instance, on that edit you only changed &amp;deg to a degree symbol (excepting one) and removed both links to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celsius.html" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> but left one to <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit.html" title="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>. Your edit summary left me wondering what you saw wrong in the first place. I would appreciate if you changed it to be a little more descriptive or linked to an explanation.

<dd>You ask what I saw wrong in the first place. There is no such unit as 'Celcius'. It is a mispelling of 'Celsius'. That is what I saw wrong. In addition, there should be a space between digits and unit symbols. I removed the mispelt word and added spaces. I hope that sounds reasonable to you. If not, feel free to revert it or revise it to the way that you think is best.

<dd>I am also interested in what you say about it being wrong. I know that the google horsepower conversion is only the American one. I have never tried google with kbps but would be interested to hear of the issue. Can you expand on that? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 14:07, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. As you might know, units like <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobit.html" title="Kilobit">kilobit</a> <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_prefix.html" title="Binary prefix">are ambiguous</a> and can mean either 1024 bits or 1000 bits (which google calculator doesn't mention; it just assumes the 1024 values). In context of <a href="../../../k/b/p/Kbps.html" title="Kbps">kbps</a>, it is <i>always</i> 1000 bits, though, and google still returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=1+kbps+in+bps" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=1+kbps+in+bps" rel="nofollow">1024</a>. Other calculations like this have the same problem, so just be careful. There might be other errors lurking... - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 14:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not know that google did that. Interesting. Thanks. I have not used google to convert kbps at all. I have done plenty of replacements of the *unit term* 'kbps' to 'kbit/s' and 'Kbps' to 'kbit/s' (note lower case 'k'). I have done the same with mbps and gbps. I have also tried to convert 'K', 'kb' and 'KB' to 'kB' where I am fairly sure that is what was intended. I cannot recall an instance where I modified the associated numerical value. So what I have done is in line with what you say.</dd>

<dd>I am sensitive to the possibility of Google being incorrect. It is also possible that I will make errors. But I hope that an assessment of my performance overall would demonstrate a very low error rate. You will note that I say 'possibly using google converter'. I want to make people aware that google can help them with conversions. If they see this summary often enough, they might try it for themselves.</dd>

<dd>In many cases I don't use google at all, I am just suggesting that I *may* have used it. I have done so many conversions that I know many of them by heart. In addition, I sometimes don't use google to convert the units, but use google merely as an arithmetic calculator using the conversion value in official sources. For example, UK unit conversion values are defined in law at: <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm</a> <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 14:35, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have reverted it back to the version with <i>fill in</i>. I put back your spelling correction of 'Febuary' too. You could replace 'fill in' with &lt;!-- fill in --&gt; and that would make it invisible to ordinary readers but visible to editors.</dd>

<p>Bobblewik,</p>
<p>You recently updated a page I started (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Stone_Lake_7c05.html" title="Big Stone Lake">Big Stone Lake</a>) with unit conversions (thank you) and by changing the "References" section title to "External links" (no thank you). I labeled it references because those were the sources of information I used to write the article; therefore they are formatted as references and properly called such. "External links" is the same thing as "further reading"; those items are ones that may be of interest to someone wanting to learn more, but not necessarily used as an information source for the article. Therefore this change was inappropriate, and I have changed it back. Please don't make that change again unless you confirm whether or not the items listed were actually used as references.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The change from 'References' to 'External links' was a minor point for me. My main motivation for editing that page relates to units. I take note of your comment and understand your point. I do not mind at all that you have changed it back. I will not promise to constrain myself to confirm future changes with other editors, but I will certainly be less inclined to make this change in future and will be more likely to think of the point you have made. I hope that is in-line with the spirit of what you ask.</dd>

<p>Bobblewik, please read <a href="../../../e/m/i/Talk%7EEmitter_4557.html" title="Talk:Emitter">Talk:Emitter</a>.

<p>Thanks for your reply in <a href="../../../e/m/i/Talk%7EEmitter_4557.html" title="Talk:Emitter">Talk:Emitter</a>. I have answered there. But I also wanted to reply to a more general statement you made there:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a matter of philosophy, Wikipedia is an international resource, written by international contributors and targetted at international readers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I certainly agree with this statement. However, just because it's international doesn't mean that it should <i>exclude</i> points of view or usages that are restricted to some part of the world. Quite the contrary: the philosophy of NPOV encourages us to document a <i>variety</i> of points of view, but also admonishes us not to inject our own preferences about how things ought to be. PSI and kPa are both ways of talking about water pressure that are actually used in the world at large; lbf/inÂ² is technically correct, and appropriately used in some technical contexts, but much much rarer. It is POV to deem it superior to PSI and systematically expunge that usage. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 04:14, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bobblewik, I've looked over some of your other edits to understand your philosophy of units. If I'm not mistaken, it is to prefer SI units rather than other metric units, e.g. 1.20m rather than 120cm or 1200mm. This is a very sensible philosophy in some contexts -- notably physics articles -- but I do not think it makes sense in general. Different fields have different practices in their use of units in metric countries. For example, furniture designers in Europe use mm, whereas architects use cm. The size of plots of land (house lots, parks, cities) is usually expressed in hectares (hA) -- sometimes in ares for small lots --, not in mÂ² or kmÂ², but floor space is always expressed in mÂ². Beverages are usually measured in cl, not ml or l, while gasoline/petrol is measured in liters. Gasoline mileage of automobiles is expressed in liters/100 km, not in km/liter. etc. etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:13, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll throw my two cents worth in on a couple of points.
<ul>
<li>Millimeters and centimeters are SI, even if you'd spell them -re. Though centimeters (and anything else using the prefixes which are not powers of 1000) are SI, they are of limited utility and should not be used where there use is not well established, or where it is clearly a holdover from old <a href="../../../c/g/s/Cgs.html" title="Cgs">cgs</a> usage</li>
<li>It's okay to revert Bobblewik when he changes hectares. But use the proper symbol, ha, not hA.</li>
<li>Centiliters/centilitres and deciliters/deciliters are totally foreign to much of the world, and decreasing in use in Europe. Use the universally understood milliliters or liters. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 04:07, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks to all of you for your feedback and interesting points. I hope I do not miss anything when I respond as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>just because it's international doesn't mean that it should</i> exclude <i>points of view or usages that are restricted to some part of the world. Quite the contrary: the philosophy of NPOV encourages us to document a</i> variety <i>of points of view</i>.<br />
Good point. Inclusiveness is part of my motivation. Changing a single non-international format to a single international format increases inclusiveness. A change in the other direction decreases it. Additional supplementary formats optimised for particular languages and regions seem unnecessary if the international version is comprehensible. But I have objection in principle to supplementing an international format with a variety of additional non-international formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>your philosophy of units. If I'm not mistaken, it is to prefer SI units rather than other metric units</i><br />
That is a fair summary, although not as I would put it. My primary preference is for SI instead of non-SI. People seem to agree about the definition of SI but not about the definition of 'metric'. For example, since 1968, the SI authority has said that SI is the 'modern form of the metric system'. It may no longer be 'modern' and you could interpret their statement as meaning 'SI' and 'metric system' are synonyms. Other than the SI authority, there is no metric system authority. But that may be an esoteric point. Your summary should predict my edits. If somebody writes 2.2 quintals claiming the 100 kg version of quintal is 'metric', I would change it to 220 kg.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>SI units rather than other metric units, e.g. 1.20m rather than 120cm or 1200mm</i>.<br />
Not quite. All three (1.2 m, 120 cm, 1200 mm) are correct SI and are consistent with my primary preference for SI. I have a secondary preference for powers of 1000 in unit formats. I think it can be traced to an ISO standard. The newer SI prefixes are consistent with that but not the older ones. As you might expect, I care more about my primary preference than my secondary preferences.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Different fields have different practices in their use of units in metric countries.</i><br />
Indeed. I am glad you mention that. It is a popular misconception that the USA is 100% wrong and 'metric countries' are 100% right. Even 'metric countries' differ. Many have widespread non-compliances that would be criticised if it were America e.g. use of 'dunams' and 'quintals'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As far as hectares are concerned, this has been discussed at length and I don't think there is much new to say. Hectares are widespread when addressing certain audiences. In some cases either unit is used for the same area, sometimes a piece of text will include both. But they are not as comprehensible to the general public as SI units. If I understand Gene correctly, he will tolerate hectares for areas less than 10 kmÂ².</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>For example, furniture designers in Europe use mm, whereas architects use cm...Beverages are usually measured in cl, not ml or l,</i><br />
Hmm. It is not true to say that 'European architects use cm' and drinks are in cl not ml. The European architects that I have encountered use mm and not cm. I expect for the same reason that I do. The suggestion that drinks throughout Europe are always in cl not ml is also unsupportable. I do notice that countries differ in this respect. Some countries use 'dl' and in others it would be regarded as incomprehensible. Perhaps you could name the European country you are thinking of.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Gasoline mileage of automobiles is expressed in liters/100 km, not in km/liter.</i><br />
I know. This does not fit with the idea that multipliers should be on the numerator. SI expresses volume in cubic metres and length in metres and we could reduce it to units of area. Then we might suggest that fuel should really be in units of energy just like it is when you recharge an electric vehicle or fuel your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>I 'touch' a lot of articles at a fairly high rate. So it is inevitable that lots of people see my edits. There are a lot of weird and wonderful formats used but there are a few people that try to raise the quality of unit formats throughout Wikipedia. I hope that number of people is increasing. Hopefully, responses such as 'hmm that edit seems odd to me' or 'that edit is wrong' are less common than satisfactory acceptance. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 14:13, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed your RfC and went to take a look, and it seemed like a big mess. Have you tried to communicate with the anon contributor? What's been the result, if any? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">âMorven</a> 04:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have not tried to communicate. I guess that as a matter of etiquette, I should have done that before mentioning it. Mea culpa. It was just one of those experiences that makes me sigh. My main priority, as I am sure you know is correct use of units. The has been no real opposition to correct use of units. So I am reluctant to enter into a debate with a user about issues that do not rank first on my priority list. I should let it go, as I did the first time I was reverted.</dd>

<p>Several weeks ago, you voted in the WikiProject Aircraft Specifications Survey. One of the results of the survey was that the specifications for the various aircraft articles will now be displayed using a template. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricg_f5fa.html" title="User:Ericg">Ericg</a> and I have just finished developing that template; a lengthier bulletin can be found on the <a href="../../../a/i/r/WT%7EAir_e39a.html" title="WT:Air">WT:Air</a> talkpage. Naturally, we will need to begin a drive to update the aircraft articles. However, several topics in the survey did reach establish consensus, and they need to be resolved before we implement the template. It is crticial that we make some conclusion, so that updating of the specs can resume as soon as possible.

<dd>My two cents. In the case of dates of lifespan (or some other things such as regnal dates) immediately following a person's name, that is one situation in which replacing an en dash with the word "to" is really stupid and should not be done. I agree with the replacement in the case of many measurements, but this particular usage is well established, conventional, and nearly impossible to confuse with a minus sign. I will revert such changes whenever I run across them. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:48, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for uniforming the units and links on this article, but I've restored the tables you changed. Basically, when u turned the tables into lists, it ended up distorting the continuation of the article. The tables were placed there as a sidenote to the reader since several people complained of not being able to keep the victims straight as they read, they're not ment to be lists with their own section, but sidenotes; the list of victims has its own article. Also, the location of pictures has caused a distortion in which half the list was off center than the rest. Most of all... it just made the article look ugly (no offense). Your other edits are still there, since I thought they were great and I appreciate them, but just wanted to let you know about the lists/tables. Thanks! <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 18:58, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The table edits were the lowest priority of my edits. In fact, I started editing the table partly to because I thought it would be better to replace the top style section with class="wikitable". I also thought the text was a bit small to read. Then I considered that mandating left-align is redundant because that is the default.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>After various changes I just thought that a single column is hardly a table, it is a list. I then noticed that the layout was messed up and I did not want to get further involved. Sorry about that. I don't mind at all that you reverted it. The other edits were less dramatic, but actually I think they added more value. Thanks for the feedback.

<p>They don't work. A redirect that points to another redirect will only take you as far as the second redir, not to the article. There are several reasons for this, one is to prevent loops, another is for performance, another is just to encourage tidiness. Anyway, that's the way the software works, and I don't think there's any proposal to change it.</p>
<p>Three redirects already pointed to watt electrical, and were broken by your making it into a redirect, affecting a long list of articles that linked to them. So before making an existing page into a redirect, please check for redirects that already point to it, and change them to point to the new target. You don't need to change the articles, just the existing redirects. Then no links will be broken. I've fixed these ones.

<dd>Incidentally, there a big cleanup and reorganisation of units of measurement articles. This is being discussed at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnits_of_measurement_7c0f.html" title="Talk:Units of measurement">Talk:Units of measurement</a>. The changes to <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt.html" title="Watt">watt</a> subarticles is part of that. SI unit (candela, watt, farad, seconds etc) articles explain their own multiples (microwatt, milliwatt, kilowatt, gigawatt etc). However, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megawatt.html" title="Megawatt">Megawatt</a> is unique amonst Category:Units of power in having its own article. I tried to create a redirect but was reverted. If you have an opinion on the cleanup/reorganisation or just on <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megawatt.html" title="Megawatt">Megawatt</a>, I would be happy if you would share it in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnits_of_measurement_7c0f.html" title="Talk:Units of measurement">Talk:Units of measurement</a>.</dd>

<p>(back to margin)Yes, Bobblewik needs to be aware that there is little clear consensus for anything in those discussionsâand a certain wait-and-see attitude among those willing to consider the changes. There is ongoing discussion, with many areas not really agreed upon. You, Docu, should jump in with whatevery you have to say about it. It is an ongoing process; as various attempts at reorganization are attempted, there are often new little problems which crop up. Eventually it will probably sort itself all out.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to push the envelope in order to get something accomplished.

<p>Hi.

(which I noticed you changed) In the case of <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecule.html" title="Molecule">molecule</a> I guess it's quite arbitrary, but in the case of intercalation I think angstrems are more popular - people in molecular biology and chemistry are rather used to angstrems.

<dd>I agree with you that usage is somewhat arbitrary and varies by domain. I think it varies by region too. SI terms are more than valid and commonplace in science, they are universally comprehensible to scientists and specifically encouraged by scientific publications. In any case, Wikipedia is not a specialist publication limited to biologists or chemists. It is a reference source specifically intended to cross many domains and regions. Thus the universally accessible term 'nanometre' is better than a term such as 'angstrom'. That is how I see it anyway. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 13:05, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Bobblewik. Reference texts very often limit themselves to listing the field-specific units alone, with many authors being very reluctant to the SI unit "globalization". A suggestion: whenever you include the SI unit, it'd be both useful and educational if you left the field-specific unit enclosed in a parentheses.

<dd>Thanks for your feedback. Mea culpa. I don't use a bot. All edits are manual but I sometimes use editing tools (e.g. search and replace in a Word processor). So I am responsible for it all, good or not so good. My main motivation is almost always units. I sometimes do incidental things while I am there that I think are improvements, but they are rarely as important to me as the units.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the last line in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browning_Model_1917_machine_gun_2031.html" title="Browning Model 1917 machine gun">Browning Model 1917 machine gun</a> is concerned, I don't see the error that you see. I changed it to sentence case and added the metric weight in brackets. I also took the qualifying text out of brackets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-tank_rifle_wz.35.html" title="Anti-tank rifle wz.35">Anti-tank rifle wz.35</a> is concerned, what I did there was convert a hyphen to the word 'to'. I prefer the word 'to' for ranges because it does not get confused with a minus. That is more important in units than dates. In this case, my manual editing wrote over one of the square brackets by mistake.</dd>

<dd>As far as the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_page_content_894f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/page content">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Aircraft/page_content</a> standard is concerned, I think you are doing the right thing to follow the standard. I happen to think the page is improved by a removal of bolding so that is why I did it. But it is not a big deal for me. I appreciate the constructive manner in which you have given me feedback. Unfortunately, as a human rather than a bot, I cannot reprogram myself to avoid errors but I will try to take more care. Thanks for mentioning it. Feel free to put the articles the way you want, including reverting any of my edits.</dd>

<dd>I don't run a script. All my work involves my fingers on the keyboard. Land, sea and air vehicle articles usually contain units so if I see one in the 'Recent changes' list, I may check it.</dd>

<dd>As far as conversion is concerned, I already know the conversion of 20 knots. But in many cases I use the amazingly easy Google converter.

<p>Hi, on the above article, u removed the links for distinct years with the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">edit summary</a>, <i>Reduce overlinking: dates need linking for preferences to work but solitary years and solitary months do not have preferences so don't need linking.</i> However the links are not for the proper working of preferences alone; for example, a solitary year when clicked would lead me to the page of that year which mentions the most important happenings in that year. This gives the reader the choice to understand the temporal context under which those happenings occurred. regards, --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 16:39, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, the user has that choice. But I don't think that Wikipedia readers are unsatisfied in that urge. Nor do I think links to years are provided for that reason. They almost certainly exist because of a misunderstanding of date preferences.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, Americans like to see April 12, 1981 and Brits like to see 12 April 1981. If square brackets are added, the Wikipedia software amends the format so that the sequence matches that chosen by the reader in the preference settings. It should not really be called a 'link' at all, the actual 'link' to the article is merely a secondary effect.</p>
<p>Date elements that are unambiguous across cultures (such as a year on its own: <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>) do not involve date preferences and so do not need the square brackets for reformatting. It is explained (not very well) at: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Date_formatting" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Date_formatting</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Internal_links" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)#Internal_links</a></p>
<p>This issue is widely misunderstood. Lots of dates get linked on Wikipedia and some people think that means *all* must be linked. However, this is not supported in any Wikipedia guidance. There is no assertion that reader access to date articles is insufficiently satisfied.</p>
<p>I think linking of solitary-years and solitary-months is overlinking. If that is what people want, it is fine by me but I think it has just become one of the things that editors do without thinking too much.</p>
<p>The issue is discussed from time to time. For example at: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Dates_linking_convention_currently_ludicrous" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Dates_linking_convention_currently_ludicrous</a>. Anyway, if you want the links to solitary years in the article, feel free to put them back. Although you might wish to consider whether an article needs more than one link to the same article. Thanks for bringing this here. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 16:56, 12 October 2005 (UTC) <a name="Linking" id="Linking"></a></p>

<p>So I'm still not clear what software you use to do these conversions. I asked in <a href="#google_units" title="">#google_units</a> that you include a link to a short description in the edit summary (like "Units, maybe using Google converter" that is a link to <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html#Units" title="User:Bobblewik">User:Bobblewik#Units</a> or something), but doesn't look like you have.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started writing some javascript to do automatic unit fixing, and then remembered yours, and don't want to waste my time writing something that you've already written. Is it anything I could use? â <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 01:20, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For a while, I did include a link to a section as you suggested. Then I gave up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Google calculator really is simpler and more powerful than any converter I have seen. It is also universally available. You don't have to do anything special with google to get it to convert. Just do a 'search'. For example do a search for '5 feet' and see what happens. Try it. Once you have done that, I will tell you more about what it can do. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 09:34, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was probably a mistake to pick that out. The standard airliner parking bay allows for a wingspan of 200' 6" as I understand it (the E350 is 200' 5" wingspan). It would fit in the general rule of "measurements for air, rail and sea transport". <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 11:42, 31 October 2005 (UTC) Oh right, your change is good. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 11:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no <i>general rule</i> exempting air transport. Exemptions are specific. There are legal documents that include the requirement for aircraft altitude to be in feet. But no legal document (as far as I know) requires aircraft parking bays to be described in feet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, such an exemption is unnecessary. The description of an aircraft parking bay in feet and inches is no more remarkable than the description of a bed in feet and inches without reference to metric units. Both are entirely legal. In fact, the article mentions this situation when it says:<br />
<i>Thus, a fence panel sold as "6 foot by 6 foot" will continue to be legal after 2009 but a pole sold as "50 pence per linear foot" is illegal.</i><br />
It is odd to mention the legal status of something as specific as aircraft parking bays, when something as mundane as furniture has the same status.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes I agree. And it's probably not the <b>A</b>350 anyway... However it's not merely a description, I believe it's governed by an international agreement, because of the required interoperability of aircraft and airports, imagine if the parking space was two inches too narrow... And the reason I put it in was that Airbus had (as I recollect) gone to within a very small distance (1 inch?) of the maximum size. But it probably would be better with a source, and in a different article.</dd>

<p>I would love to fix those errors, but it would probably find too many false positives, I'll keep an eye out for them though as there don't seem to be too man left now. thanks [23:06, 21 November 2005 Bluemoose]</p>

<dd>Thanks. Presumably anything between equal signs (==) can be regarded as a section heading. So I can't see how false positives would occur. Although I have no experience of bots.

<p>Bobblewik, good job on your spacing work on some of the film pages, but please be careful about uncapitalizing external links, as you did for the Fuji link on <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_stock.html" title="Film stock">Film stock</a>. When the caps are in the file name for .jsp and similar file extensions, as that one was, uncapitalizing the link makes the link invalid.

<p>Hello, I see you've edited the Canon lenses to update the spacing between the focal length and 'mm'. However, this is not correct, as these are the official lens names Canon give to their lenses and do not have spaces in them as you can see in these examples <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Zoom_Lenses/index.asp?ComponentID=25223&amp;SourcePageID=26112#2" class="external text" title="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Zoom_Lenses/index.asp?ComponentID=25223&amp;SourcePageID=26112#2" rel="nofollow">here (UK)</a> and <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ProductCatIndexAct&amp;fcategoryid=148" class="external text" title="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ProductCatIndexAct&amp;fcategoryid=148" rel="nofollow">here (USA)</a>. Whether Canon should use a space is another matter, the fact remains they have not; would you please revert or edit the Canon lens pages back to their originals - thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, thanks for your feedback. Is the measurement being used as a description of a characteristic or is the absence of a space an inherent/essential part of the identity? I looked around for other examples but I only found <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Luger_Parabellum_85d8.html" title="9 mm Luger Parabellum">9 mm Luger Parabellum</a>. It isn't a big deal though.

These articles are all about the products that Canon offer, whose actual names (as Canon label and sell them) contain no spaces. Therefore, the articles should all be without spaces (otherwise I guess you could say they're just not canon... *sigh*). As incompatible with SI units as the names may be, and as commendable as going through Wikipedia and changing all SI units is, I feel strongly that Wikipedia cannot (in these instances) just change the name of products as it is quite simply not correct. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergyBlades_b2a1.html" title="User:SynergyBlades">SynergyBlades</a> 23:29, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. Actually, SI does not mandate a space, although the SI authority uses a space in publications. I think it is a recommendation in ISO 31. I agree with you that names should not be changed.

<p>Without in any way wishing to detract from your contributions on the subject of metric abbreviations, I would suggest that km if used as an adjective is correct as in a "30 km walk", but if used as a noun it should be "kms" as in "the distance from Athens to Thessaloniki is 505 kms." harfo32 23.57 Eastern European Time, 18 April 2006</p>

<dd>It says:

<li><i>If the date does not contain a day and a month, date preferences will not work, and square brackets will not respond to your readers' auto-formatting preferences. So unless there is a special relevance of the date link, there is no need to link it. This is an important point: simple months, years, decades and centuries should only be linked if there is a strong reason for doing so.

<dd>If you look at the top of your page, you will see 'my preferences'. You can choose to 'January 15' or '15 January'. Thus the date in 'Abolitionism' that is written as [[March 25]] [[1807]] will appear for some readers as '25 March 1807'. That is why people are supposed to put square brackets round the date. It is not because readers need to read the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a> article to understand abolition in the way that they might need to read the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_Abolition_Act_27be.html" title="Slavery Abolition Act">Slavery Abolition Act</a> article. Unfortunately, the mechanism for making preferences work happens to look the same as the mechanism for hyperlinks.</dd>

<dd>Bobblewik, I noticed you have edited several articles in this way. I too am a date delinker; except in special circumstances and to help the formatting of complete dates, they should not be linked. This is, as you know official policy, but I'm not sure if you know there has been some discussion on this and the policy now allows the use of linking years: "There is less agreement about links to years. Some editors believe that links to years are generally useful to establish context for the article. Others believe that links to years are rarely useful to the reader. Some advocate linking to a more specific article about that year, for example <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_sports.html" title="2006 in sports">2006</a>". While I firmly agree with your policy (there must be millions of superfluous year links out there still!), I wanted to point this out. My suggestion is that <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">WP:CONTEXT</a> is a better justification for removing superfluous links of any kind, including date links. Anyway, keep up the good work, <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 17:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bobblewik, <b>please</b> stop delinking dates. You chose not to participate in the discussion about delinking dates, but the result went against you - there was a general consensus that mass-delinking is <i>not</i> appropriate, even from supporters of delinking in general. I've rollbacked some now and will do the rest when I'm not running late for a job interview. This is a complete violation of Quadell's remedy, which you signed, and I really don't know what to do anymore. Do I have to propose arbitration to stop you from making these edits? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Ambi</a> 22:44, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your (Ambi) comment seems bizarre to me. You were the only one out of four editors that failed to acccept Quadell's remedy. Having failed to accept it, you say others should be bound by it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, two of the four editors are not editing any more so it is just you and me. A bilateral remedy cannot work with only one side accepting constraints. I still think the remedy is worth accepting and if you now do, that is progress. In the interests of conflict resolution, are you willing to sign Quadell's remedy? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 18:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I signed the portion of the statement that said I'd accept any consensus on the matter, as did you, yet you're making edits that weren't even supported by quite a few of the anti-date-linking folks. I'd not needed to have anything to do with date links since that agreement was signed until you restarted your against-consensus automated edits, in violation of a portion of Quadell's remedy that you <i>had</i> actually signed. Please just stop. You made a bunch more this morning which I won't revert in the interests of good faith, but if it starts again tomorrow morning I'll begin drafting an arbitration request. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Ambi</a> 01:19, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bobblewik: My personal recommendation to you would be to completely stop delinking years prior to 1900, possibly even those prior to 1970 (post-1970 or so being the most heavily-overlinked).</p>
<p>Specifically, i'd suggest changing the post-1970 years to specifics if they exist, and delinking if they dont. eg in your most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Embraer_E-Jets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52382782" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Embraer_E-Jets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52382782" rel="nofollow">recent</a> batch, change the link to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_aviation.html" title="2002 in aviation">2002 in aviation</a>, instead of delinking <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps, concentrate on delinking only dates that appear in tables (like long discographies, where the excess linking is most vexing), and similar. As opposed to links within article prose.</p>
<p>Or, ignore years and concentrate on delinking weekdays and solitary months, for which there IS a consensus to delink <i>almost</i> all occurances.</p>
<p>I fully agree with you that the excess year links are annoying, but less-so than having to re-argue the point each time. (and ambi is right, you <i>are</i> violating point#3 of Quadell/remedy by resumming mass-delinkings).</p>
<p>There are simply more important and less-contentious things you could be doing with the power of automation (like trans-wiktionary moves), than delinking eg <a href="../../../1/6/8/1683.html" title="1683">1683</a>. I hope all this helps.&#160;:) -<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 20:22, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never sought out conflict on this issue. If you concentrate on delinking weekdays and solitary months (and don't go back to this in a month's time), and don't encourage anyone else to start up in your place, there's nothing to revert, and thus no need for #4 at all. I simply refrain from signing #4 in the event that, like this week, you go back on your word and ignore the rest of the remedy. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Ambi</a> 00:56, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you suggest, Quadell's remedy cannot work if people do not accept it in full. Your fear became self fulfilling. You did not accept it because you feared it would fail through non-acceptance. It failed because you did not accept it.</dd>
<dd>Please trust Quadell, Talrias, Bobblewik, SlimVirgin, Quiddity, Farmbrough and any other well wishers that it can work. If you accept it, we can bring it to life again. It will end the conflict. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 17:44, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I notice that Ambi has added a signature with a caveat. The caveat negates the commitment. That won't work. Let us be clear, Point 4 is all about constraints following an allegation of a breach. If an allegation of a breach voids Point 4, then the remedy must vanish in a puff of circular logic. We are so close. Ambi, if you can accept Point 4 without voiding it, that will be very welcome and Quadell's remedy can work. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 15:35, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I noticed that you made many edits to several pages putting a space between the number and the unit (IE: 8 mm as opposed to 8mm), is this part of an official Wikipedia Style Sheet? Generally, especially in regard to film formats, in technical publications you will see no space 35mm is more commonly used than 35 mm.

<p>I just wanted to let you know that I think simply referencing <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> in your edit summaries can be misleading (implying that such links are forbidden when <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-L_d1af.html" title="WP:MOS-L">WP:MOS-L</a> clearly states that the linking of years is a judgement call based on context).

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>thank you very much for the date tool! I've tried it on a couple of articles and I'm enthusiastic. A real time saver. Incidentally, I'm wondering what does "dontcountme=s" do&#160;:-).

<p>Hi - I note that you have (correctly) converted the reference in this article from "4.7 million hectares" to "47,000 square kilometres". It may be advisable to retain the "4.7 million hectares", at least in paranthesis following the 47,000 sq.km. The reasons for this are that (a) official statistics on the ALR are reported in hectares; and (b) those of us involved in agriculture and agricultural land preservation normally converse in hectares or acres.</p>

<p>I'd have gladly explained (but really, you can read that in the Stravinsky article) that that date marks a change in Stravinsky's output, i.e. starting to compose in the neo-classical style.

What you might not know, and that is why date delinking is even more something not to be performed by clueless <s>hillbillies</s> contributors, is that that date (Stravinsky publishing <i>Pulcinella</i>) marks one of the most commented upon career moves in music history. If the <i>Sacre</i> (his last major ballet before <i>Pulcinella</i>) and the neo-classical style of Pulcinella ring no bells for you, then what "<a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>" were you exactly trying to make? --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 12:53, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accept your apology. Thank you. So now we can continue.</dd>
<dd>The paragraph about 1920 being a change in Stravinsky's output is interesting and probably belongs in the article. It is certainly not in the 1920 article. None of the other instances of 1920 are linked and nor is 1923. So I still do not see what added value the reader gets from the link. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 13:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, pending more details about the career move being included in the Stravinsky and/or 1920 article (but possible deficiencies of the 1920 article is not the *context* of the Stravinsky article), the fact that this date is linked is an indication given to the reader that this date *is* important in the context. That's where it should have stopped you being clueless. But it didn't.</p>
<p>So, we have two persons here:</p>
<ul>
<li>a person admitting he's clueless on the issue, insisting the date is not relevant in the context.</li>
<li>a person maybe not the ultimate authority on Stravinsky, but knowing enough about that composer to know the significance of the date in the context, and insisting the date *is* relevant in the context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, who should accept whose words, given this context?</p>
<p>So, if you can't revert your changes, you should at least admit you should have done, before getting blocked.</p>
<p>Anyway, again, you keep silent about the Sylvia article. If you'd have reverted there, and admitted it was an <i>undisputed</i> disruptive edit, irrespective of the <i>context</i> issue, I wouldn't have pushed the issue. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 14:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not understand your reasoning. You say <i>the fact that this date is linked is an indication given to the reader that this date *is* important in the context</i>. Links are not highlights to <i>indicate</i> value, links are intended to provide access to articles that add value.

<dd>I have just taken a look at the Sylvia article. I see now what happened. The dates were linked incorrectly and did not work with date preferences. That is the answer to your question.

<p>Anyway, what I'm looking for is a commitment to undo the contentious edits as described above. I don't see that commitment. Sorry, I can't help you with your block under these circumstances (if that is what you'd like â I'm not even certain about that). On the contrary, I'd recommend to extend the block to indefinite, there is even no commitment to refrain from such contentious edits in the future, although you've got plenty of people that have explained to you exactly what is so contentious about them. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 15:04, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Last chance, Bobblewik. I'm fed up with your restarting of the same edits every few weeks in the hope that people might have forgotten, even though it has now been quite clearly established that there is no consensus to make them. <i>One</i> more edit along these lines (at least without some new development on the consensus front, or even some participation from you) and I <i>will</i> begin drafting an arbitration request, and asking for an injunction that prohibits you from making any date-related edits. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:15, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody just undid all the wikilinks of standalone years (like <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>) that you put in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">gramophone record</a> - and rightly so, I think. Turning a year into a link rarely accomplishes anything, because the "year" articles are so incredibly broad that they usually have no connection to the article you're reading; following them teaches you nothing. Links to year topics (like <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_music.html" title="1975 in music">1975 in music</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_literature.html" title="1975 in literature">1975 in literature</a>) are useful, and of course links to full date (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>) are OK because they allow people's date-setting preferences to kick in. But otherwise, I'd save yourself the effort and not put any wikilinks on standalone years.

Your three-rule set seems a bit of a travesty of the agreed-upon guidance to me.

<p>I'm afraid the agreed-upon approach to guideline-writing is quite different from the scheme you try to put forward.

<p>Because a few nominators of FACs have appeared to need/desire a formal explanation of how they can improve their prose, I had the idea of writing an <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a_02d4.html" title="User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 2a">article</a> dedicated to this purpose. It would be a complement to Taxman's and Jengod's articles, and "Great writing" and "The perfect article". I wonder whether you'd mind having a look at it and letting me know what yout think, in terms of the overall concept and the effectiveness and appropriateness of the training aspect. I've completed only the introduction and the first area, "Redundancy", for which there are about 30 exercises. The remainder is just a messy paste-in of notes.</p>
<p>I don't want to continue until I have other people's opinions on the approach.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<dd>Actually I did notice those errors. But I haven't taken on the task of fixing such errors (with one exception, see below). This is because there is an huge variety of errors. There is another editor that does fix errors and our work is generally compatible.</dd>

<p>The unit script is very useful! Just one thing though. Instead of adding a regular space to 60km to make 60 km, it should add a no-break space (<tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt>), so the units don't wrap over lines, causing 60<br />
km to appear occasionally in the text. <font style="color:#77AAAA"><b>s</b>murrayinch</font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#77AAAA">ster<sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 18:54, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

It was also doing some other things that I had occasionally seen but not resolved. I discovered a small error in the code that had a significant effect. The error had been there for a long time and your report allowed me to identify it. Thanks. I have now fixed the error.

<p>Hi, Is there a page that discusses WP's standards for unit conversions? The reason I ask is I see you changed <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlaw_%28roller_coaster%29.html" title="Outlaw (roller coaster)">Outlaw (roller coaster)</a> to generalize the metric conversions. The one that really made me ask was 2800 feet, which has been listed as 853.5 meters but you changed it to 850 meters. Since the actual answer is 853.44 meters, what level of precision are we striving for? 3.5 meters seems significant to me. I can see dropping the decimal, but was surprised at dropping it down to 850. Anyway, if you can point me to some standards that would be great. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_fischer_fdad.html" title="User:Tim fischer">Rehcsif</a> 19:26, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Conversion is more an art than a science. If you think it is precise to the nearest metre, just change it to 853 m. Hope that helps.

<dd>Thanks for the quick response. I'm not sure if "The Outlaw" is precisely 2800 feet, or if that's just someone's approximation. If it were precise, I'd feel more accurate with the 83 meters.

<p>please see what 'dates' monobook does to 'List of battles 1901-2000'. I believe it is removing 'month day' entries that we are not supposed to remove (yet). Thanks <a href="../../../h/m/a/User%7EHmains_e270.html" title="User:Hmains">Hmains</a> 23:51, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I presume you are remarking on the fact that it delinks '[[May 26|26]]'. The design objective of the code is that it delinks dates unless the links are used for preferences. The dates in 'List of battles 1901-2000' do not operate correctly with preferences and are 'broken'. So the monobook tool is behaving correctly. It is the article that is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, the monobook tool should go further and delink more of the article. It should turn formats like [[May 25]]-[[May 26|26]] into May 25-26 because that is the only way it will avoid being broken. They currently look stupid like '25 May 26' with a European preference setting. However, I gave up trying to cope with all the permutations of broken dates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't understand what I mean, try changing your date preference to the second option (non-US format) labelled '09:12, 8 April 2001'. Let me know what you think.</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for the dates and units tool. I've just played with it quickly (without saving changes to articles) and it seems very useful â it will undoubtedly save a lot of time. I'll use it when I get time! <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 06:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I used the code in your unitformatter.js and modified it. It has been very successful. So thanks for that.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look and use any of the code in there. See <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_monobook.js_ee81.html" title="User:Bobblewik/monobook.js">User:Bobblewik/monobook.js</a>.

<dd>I guess we should really be doing these with nbsp's in between the numbers and units. I wish there were a less ugly solution... â <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 20:59, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I went down the nbsp route for a while. As you say it is ugly, but more importantly, it made the code more complicated and didn't always do what a human might want. So I took it out of scope. Furthermore, I don't care as much about the issue as other people seem to. If somebody else wants to take that task on, it is still possible.</dd>

<dd>Please feel free to compare my code with yours. I would be happy to work with you on improvements and then we can share it with the wider community.

<dd>What do you mean by "it didn't always do what a human might want"? The numbers and units should always have a non-breaking space between them, according to SI and our own Manual of Style. The only problem is that it makes the source code for the page ugly and difficult for non-technical types, which is why I wish there were a non-ugly syntax for non-breaking spaces.</dd>
<dd>I'll check out your additions when I have some time. â <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 15:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, I can't remember what the other issues were. I just remember that this human (me) was not satisfied with the code. That may be merely a feature of the code and perhaps that is the point i.e. I was not willing to do the extra work beyond the scope of unit formats themselves.</dd>

<p>You asked if the monobook tool would work with the classic skin and I said it would not. Would you considered going to the 'Monobook default' skin just to test it? Regards <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 17:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the tool well enough, but for some reason or another I've never made much use of automationâeven when I liked the idea. If you could figure out a way, it'd be great if you could develop a way to do it in Classic. (Or maybe I'll tryâI resolved to learn JavaScript this summer.)

<p>You seem to be putting in abbreviated units, like "kmÂ²" instead of "square kilometres". Formal English entails and the MOS states that the units ought to be spelled out in the body of an article.

<dd>For square kilometre, you are not replacing "square kilometre" with "kmÂ²", but you are replacing "hectares", "kms", and "sq. km" with "kmÂ²" when in most cases it should instead by "square kilometre(s)"</dd>

<dd>There are many cases where I agree with you that the full form would be better. I don't want to take on the task of expanding abbreviations.

There was no consensus for that change, with three editors stating positions that oppose it, and three supporting it, one tentatively, one you the implementing editor and one other editor who made a single comment in the discussion. This discussion reached no conclusion, though the last comments were a support of leaving it to individual editor decision and a revert of an edit that contained this change among others. A discussion long after, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29/archive38#Percent:_space_or_no_space" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29/archive38#Percent:_space_or_no_space" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, has two other editors who were not involved in the previous discussion recommending "percent" as standard style.</dd>
