<p>I removed all negative comments on Bobby Trendy - they dont hold much weight, and aren't needed. -youblewmahmind69times</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I understand, but I think it is important to mention Anna's true view of him because he is going on Fox News and CNN and claiming that the two of them were good friends. The clip SHOWS that she hates him which is very important. He shouldnt be allowed to misrepresent himself, and the clip proves it. Please keep it in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there is no consensus about real name (Ray Muro or the more liklely possibility Bui Trang), I'm going to remove the senetence.</p>
<p><br />
His real name is <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Trendy_5cff.html" title="Bobby Trendy"><i>Robert Trienh</i></a>.</p>
<p>It is either Bui Trang, RObert Trienh or the more likely Ray Muro.</p>
<p>Bui Trang does not sound correct as a Vietnamese name. Trang is a female name, and it is never a surname while Bui is always a surname. Trienh is not a Vietnamese surname. More than likely it is Trinh, a common Vietnamese surname. Whatever his birth name is, he has no talent other than shameless self promotion.</p>
<p>I disaggree, I think he's a brillant decorator. I also think the negative comments are untrue and uncalled for. They don't follow wiki format. The bio needs to be re-written properly without opinions. Especially negative ones. It looks like someone has just tried to piece together negative information. Linking up to sites that are based on opinions.</p>
<p>Since Smith's death I saw him interviwed on CNN and he said it seems to be more than a coincidence that the lawyer Howard K Stern was there when both Anna Nicole Smith and her son died. He must have some inside information.</p>

<p>I agree with the editor above. The article appeared to be very biased against Mr. Trendy. I have made some substantial changes, removing malicious remarks such as "He was fired from K-Mart." It would appear that some editors may have a personal vendetta against Mr. Trendy. I would caution them that Wikipedia is not a vehicle for harassment and the propagation of potentially libellous statements. I would suggest that they take their dispute with Mr. Trendy someplace other than the pages of Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> &amp; <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 21:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>1) Trendy's side of the story must be presented in order for the article to present a nuetral point of view. I, personally, think his remarks about Stern are outrageous and inflammatory; however, that is his defense for the discord seen on the show. In fairness, we must present his point of view.</dd>
<dd>2) The citation you provided is unclear. What clip? Which clip? The source you are providing is neither verifible nor accessible. This is petty over kill, and really unnecessary. Frankly, I think that the preceeding paragraph makes it very clear that there was discord between them. The fact that he did appear on the majority of the episodes, however, speaks to the fact that there was a substantial relationship between them.</dd>
<dd>3) Trendy appeared in THIRTEEN EPISODES. His was the ONLY ongoing plotline that I can see in the series. Can you name another ongoing plotline in season one? I don't think there is one.</dd>
<dd>4) The word homosexual is more proper than the term gay.</dd>

<p>-- All I am attempting to do is leave up actual footage from the anna nicole show. It seems like you have finally agreed and have left up the link. In response to your comment #2 above - since I am apparently not allowed to comment below you (though you did it to me) I am talking about this clip - which is currently citation 10. I simply moved it because it was out of context. I gave it a few words context like "in this clip". It's hardly an ad for amazon.com if that's your next argument. I don't think amazon.com needs advertisement on here. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP3EQG/ref=atv_dp_ep_series/105-4018483-6346046?ie=UTF8&amp;season=1" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP3EQG/ref=atv_dp_ep_series/105-4018483-6346046?ie=UTF8&amp;season=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP3EQG/ref=atv_dp_ep_series/105-4018483-6346046?ie=UTF8&amp;season=1</a></p>
<p>-- To your point # 3 - I inserted several other plotlines that were also "major" and did not involve bobby trendy summarized directly from the wiki entry on the anna nicole show. Therefore, we no longer need to refer to Bobby trendy as a major plotline. I don't think they belong in this entry, but since you insist on seeing other plotlines, there they are.</p>
<p>-- To your point # 4 - One does not act "flamboyantly homosexual" - that is a derogatory stereotype. Homosexuality is the attraction to a member of the same sex. One can act effeminate, not homosexual. The term "flamboyantly gay" is used on occasion, and "gay" has less of a clinical connotation than homosexual. Perhaps you are too heterosexual to understand these subtle differences, but they matter. By analogy, what would happen if I say that he "acted increasingly Asian"? Does that clear it up for you?</p>
<p>-- To your point # 1 - How many encyclopedia entries are filled with quotes about one's opinion of a friend of a friend? They don't belong here. You say you're "telling both sides of the story" but this is not the entry about anna nicole's death controversy. It doesn't belong here. How is it central to bobby's biography?</p>
<p>In general, it should be noted that nobody in the entire reality tv universe likes this person. I don't have a vendetta - he was listed as one of the most hated reality tv characters of all time like omarosa. What I said about his clients in 2000 is true. The article you posted was in <i>present tense</i> though the article was from 2000. You cannot claim someone's clients from 7 years ago are their current clients (unless you are trying to artificially make them look good). Also, as far as bobby being hated (which I never even posted per wiki's policy) This is not MY bias. Just look around:</p>

<p>I don't run these websites. I have never met him. I just don't like the fact he goes on Fox and CNN and makes little snide comments about Howard, so I thought I'd set the record straight by posting the clip to the anna nicole show. Bobby is quite hated for his behavior, failure to deliver, and attitude. He was hated by anna, and the clip makes it clear. They were not friends, despite his quote from Howard Stern that you posted.User:66 13:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the second time this article has been nominated for deletion. The first was in 2006, and Bobby Trendy has not satisfied the notability criteria any more today than he has in the past. Just because Anna Nicole died does not make him more notable beyond the initial media storm that is happening. He is simply anna nicole smith's ex decorator who appeared on a dozen episodes of a TV show on a cable channel over 3 years ago. Nominated for deletion per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29</a> User:66. 12:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC) We can discuss this here.</p>
<p>I disagree, there are many articles about fictional figures in television and not only is Trendy a real person he has notability besides the show through his occupation. Whether one agrees with his style or not. With the current focus on Smith this is even more apparent - I went to her page to see if the case that went to the Supreme Court would continue on behalf of her daughter, then saw a link to this page and remebered him and wanted more info so came here and the first thing you see is a nomination for deletion from an editor who didn't even bother to sign in.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 18:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree too, he is becoming a household name. He's had many more articles written on him by third parties. So keep the article, but someone should upload a picture(s), I couldn't figure out how to do it. --<a href="../../../9/d/b/User%7E9dbfg.html" title="User:9dbfg">9dbfg</a> Tuesday, Feb 27, 2007</p>

<li>Bobby himself claims to be 18. Even though there's no possible way it's true, it should be worth mentioning since that's his "official" stance on the matter.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a> 23:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks Alcy. Hmmm, when did he claim to be 18? If it was recently, then he had to be 14-ish at the time <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Anna_Nicole_Show_bc2d.html" title="The Anna Nicole Show">The Anna Nicole Show</a> was produced. I'm almost willing to bet that in 10 years he'll claim the show came out before he was born... No reason for my little blurb really, I just find what he says to be so incredibly odd that it ends up being funny if I think about it enough (not that there's any reason to do so but still). Hmmm... If he did graduate from <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valencia_High_School_c930.html" title="Valencia High School">Valencia High School</a>, then there should be some kind of alumni association that may be able to dig up a photo/senior portrait(?).

<dd><a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a>, I assume that you are refering to the TMZ article about "Bobby's" doll line. I think it's pretty safe to say that Trendy's my space posting regarding "his" age and height are either A) a joke or B) in reference to the doll. FYI - I have removed the statement about a doll line. The TMZ article is pretty clear that they are only speculating based upon Bobby's My Space page. Neither strikes me as a "reliable" source. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 21:52, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am leaving in the article in the state that IP User 66 has left it for the moment. I have asked an administrator to take a look at the article, which I believe has become heavily biased against Trendy contrary to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. I have also suggested that the article be locked from anonymous IP editors, as there appears to be an ongoing problem with the insertion of vandalism and unsourced POV statements. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 20:17, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
