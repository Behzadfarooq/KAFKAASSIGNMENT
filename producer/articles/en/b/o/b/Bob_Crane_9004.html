<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, Crane started his broadcasting career at WLEA in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornell%2C_New_York_f61c.html" title="Hornell, New York">Hornell, New York</a>, from which he quickly moved to WBIS in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol%2C_Connecticut_2788.html" title="Bristol, Connecticut">Bristol, Connecticut</a>, followed by <a href="../../../w/i/c/WICC-AM_600_3a45.html" title="WICC-AM 600">WICC</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeport%2C_Connecticut_494c.html" title="Bridgeport, Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, a 500-watt operation where he remained until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, when the CBS radio network plucked Crane out to help stop his huge popularity from affecting their own station's ratings, and then Crane moved his family to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> to host the morning show at <a href="../../../k/n/x/KNX_33eb.html" title="KNX">KNX</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. He filled the broadcast with sly wit, drumming, and guests including <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a>, and it quickly became the number-one rated morning show in the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">LA</a> area, with Crane known as "The King of the Los Angeles Airwaves."</p>
<p>Crane's acting ambitions led to his subbing for <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Carson_bdcc.html" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a> on the daytime game show <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Do_You_Trust__afc0.html" title="Who Do You Trust?">Who Do You Trust?</a></i> and appearances on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twilight_Zone_97ab.html" title="The Twilight Zone">The Twilight Zone</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_e1cc.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_Theater_a5e5.html" title="General Electric Theater">General Electric Theater</a></i>.

<p>In 1965, Crane was offered the starring role in a television comedy pilot about a German <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">P.O.W.</a> camp. <i><a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogan%27s_Heroes_7d21.html" title="Hogan's Heroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></i>, with a spirit resembling that of the films <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalag_17.html" title="Stalag 17">Stalag 17</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Escape_22a2.html" title="The Great Escape">The Great Escape</a></i>, became a hit and finished in the Top Ten in its first year on the air. The series lasted six seasons, and Crane was nominated for an <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> twice, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.

<p>Following the cancellation of <i>Hogan's Heroes</i> in 1971, Crane continued to act, appearing in two Disney films and a number of TV shows, including <i><a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_Woman_%28TV_series%29_3cd0.html" title="Police Woman (TV series)">Police Woman</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy%2C_M.E._5fb8.html" title="Quincy, M.E.">Quincy, M.E.</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Love_Boat_244d.html" title="The Love Boat">The Love Boat</a></i>. A second series of his own, 1975's <i>The Bob Crane Show</i>, was cancelled by NBC after three months.</p>
<p>During the run of <i>Hogan's Heroes</i>, Crane met John Henry Carpenter, an electronics expert who sold <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_cassette_recorder.html" title="Video cassette recorder">VCRs</a>. Carpenter is alleged by some to have lured Crane into a life of sexual decadence. Although Crane's family contests this version of the story, it is a fact that Crane made home videotapes of numerous sexual orgies, using video technology supplied by Carpenter, with Carpenter also usually participating in the orgies. Crane is known to have made pornographic films as early as 1956, so Carpenter was an enabler of Crane's addiction rather than an original corrupter.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>For several years Crane led an increasingly dissolute life which affected his public image and his ability to get steady work. Finally, one late night in 1978, Crane allegedly called Carpenter to tell him that their friendship was over. The following day, Crane was discovered violently bludgeoned to death with a weapon that was never found but believed to be a camera tripod at the Winfield Place Apartments in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona_bd9b.html" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>, where he had been appearing in a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinner_theatre.html" title="Dinner theatre">dinner theatre</a> production of a play entitled <i>Beginner's Luck</i> at the Windmill Dinner Theatre.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_Network_d385.html" title="A&amp;E Network">A&amp;E</a> program on the subject, initial police investigation turned up few clues but a large number of suspects, due to the dozens of homemade <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornographic</a> videos found at the murder scene. Countless female participants and their spouses were questioned. Although Carpenter was the prime suspect, he wasn't arrested until 1992 - fourteen years after the murder. During Carpenter's trial in 1994, the prosecution showed videotape of Crane and Carpenter engaging in sex with the same woman to demonstrate their close relationship and hopefully shock the jury into convicting Carpenter. But the strategy backfired, and Carpenter was acquitted. Both the murder and the motive remain unsolved. Carpenter maintained his innocence and continued to hope for a solution to Crane's murder until his death on September 4 1998.</p>
<p>Crane's life and murder were the subject of the 2002 film <i><a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Focus_eef6.html" title="Auto Focus">Auto Focus</a></i>, written and directed by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Schrader_62f2.html" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>. The film portrays Crane as a happily married, churchgoing family man and popular L.A. disc jockey who suddenly becomes a Hollywood celebrity, and just as rapidly becomes a sex addict, hanging out at strip clubs and participating in orgies. He documents his exploits on video tape, and is compelled by his addiction into ever more salacious excesses, which eventually crowd everything else out of his life: marriage, family, non-sexual friends, career.</p>
<p>Crane's second wife and their son Scotty (a.k.a. Bob Jr.) objected to the way Crane was portrayed in the film, and took to the media to present their side of the story. Shortly before the film's release, Scotty also started the website <a href="http://www.bobcrane.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bobcrane.com" rel="nofollow">www.bobcrane.com</a> to provide documents and testimony that would contest the movie's version of his father's story. The website notably featured clips from a pornographic home video Bob Crane had made in 1956, before his meeting with Carpenter. (Scotty later removed the pornographic clips from the site.)</p>
<p>In an interview posted to the site, Scotty stated, "My father had been having extramarital affairs and photographing hundreds of nude women engaged in sexual activity since the 1940s. He did not suddenly become a 'sex addict' when he met my mother. We have amateur home erotic movies of his that date back to 1956, and I can assure you that the women in those movies were not his wife at the time. [...]</p>
<p>"My father did attend church -- when people died. He wasn't religious and he didn't raise me to be religious. The whole mythology about him being this church-going saint that was brought down and corrupted by the evils of Hollywood -- is really just a dramatic way to dress up a story. But it's totally untrue. He was an overly sexual person from an early age. In the twelve years that my mom knew him, he went to church three times: my baptism, his father's funeral and his own funeral. He never had a family priest for a ‘buddy’ as <i>Auto Focus</i> depicts".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
