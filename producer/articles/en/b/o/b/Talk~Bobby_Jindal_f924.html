<p>Jindal's position on abortion should be reported in a non-partisan manner. The phrase "no abortions, no exceptions" is from a negative campaign mailer sent out by the Louisiana Democratic Party in the 2003 Gubernatorial campaign.</p>
<p>Here is a fair-use quote from a newsstory on capitolwatch.reallouisiana.com (a website of the Gannett News Service) from 12NOV2003</p>
<p><br />
"<b>Abortion again an issue in gubernatorial runoff</b></p>
<p>"The abortion issue arose Monday.</p>
<p>"A state Democratic Party mailer sent to women voters calls attention to Jindal's "no abortion, no exceptions" position. "Bobby Jindal is willing to let Louisiana women die to protect his extreme agenda," it says.</p>
<p>"Jindal said he was offended by the mailer.</p>
<p>"But Democratic Party Chairman Mike Skinner said the mailer's point "is simply to let Louisiana voters know Mr. Jindal's stand on the issues, and that is it in a nutshell."</p>
<p>"Blanco and Jindal both oppose abortion, but Blanco supports the exception for rape, incest and to save the life of the woman.</p>
<p>"Jindal opposes the exceptions but said if a procedure to save the life of the woman is performed that results in an abortion, that's OK. Gambit newspaper in New Orleans also said Jindal told it he supports the use of emergency-room contraception for rape victims who request it.</p>
<p>"The Blanco campaign said someone is making telephone calls in the Lafayette area saying Blanco is pro-choice."</p>
<p><br />
It is reasonable to presume that the Gannett News Service is a credible source from which to derive Jindal's abortion position.</p>
<p>Also, the word "controversial" in the passage title is subjective (it can be as negative as the word "popular" is positive), so let us just use a neutral phrase, like "Policy positions".</p>

<p>While this term may have been used in a mailer that some people may view as negative, it is a truthful statement to state that this is Bobby Jindal's stance on the abortion issue.</p>
<p>When I cited those three sources, they confirm this position. It is a truthful statement and there is nothing wrong with stating the truth. Notice the second link provided where Jindal states this in his own words "'I am 100 percent anti-abortion with no exceptions.".</p>
<p>He embraces the platform of "no abortions, no exceptions", he is not ashamed of it, so why should that not be the explanaton of his stance?</p>
<p>And since when has refering to "no abortions, no exceptions" been a partisan explanation of his stance on abortion? It is a description of the stance embraced by many in the pro-life community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.prolifepac.com/html/who1kcoll.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prolifepac.com/html/who1kcoll.htm" rel="nofollow">prolifepac</a> clearly uses such a phrase to describe itself. The <a href="http://www.all.org" class="external text" title="http://www.all.org" rel="nofollow">American Life League</a> is also clear that they wish to have no exceptions in any abortion law/amendment that is passed.</p>
<p>When it comes to the word "controversial", this is an area in the Jindal encyclopedia entry that deals with the issues that he supports that cause controversy. Will you deny that the three issues cited in this portion of the entry are controversial? Are there arguments over wether r not abortions should be allowed for rape cases? Yes. Since there are, there is controversy.</p>
<p>I could see the argument of being unbiased if the terms "radical" or "extremist" where used, but not controversial because those are issues that are, in fact, highly controversial.</p>
<p>For example, if I was discussing Michal Moore's theatrical release of F911, I could describe it as being controversial. This is a true and unbiased statement. There was much controversy surrounding that film. The same could be said for any issue that invokes emotional debates, such as a Jindals stance on abortion.</p>
<p>I would note that the wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> includes the term controversy. "Abortion has sometimes been a bitterly-fought battle in politics, particularly in the United States. The real <b>controversy</b> in the U.S. started in 1973 with the case of Roe vs. Wade, when the Supreme Court ruled abortion to be a constitutionally protected right. Specifically, they ruled that states could not forbid a woman to terminate her pregnancy in the first three months (the first trimester) of her pregnancy."</p>
<p>-sources</p>
<p>One report on his stance on abortion can be seen <a href="http://capitolwatch.reallouisiana.com/html/BC4983D2-AC99-421E-83DC-00FD0707A94D.shtml" class="external text" title="http://capitolwatch.reallouisiana.com/html/BC4983D2-AC99-421E-83DC-00FD0707A94D.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> where it states "Blanco and Jindal both oppose abortion, but Blanco supports the exception for rape, incest and to save the life of the woman. Jindal opposes the exceptions but said if a procedure to save the life of the woman is performed that results in an abortion, that's OK."</p>
<p>Jindal is directly quoted on his stance on abortion <a href="http://www.siecus.org/policy/PUpdates/arch03/arch030075.html" class="external text" title="http://www.siecus.org/policy/PUpdates/arch03/arch030075.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where it states "On abortion, Jindal told the paper, 'I am 100 percent anti-abortion with no exceptions. I believe all life is precious.' "</p>
<p>The Gambit Weekly sites his stance as <a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2003-11-04/commentary.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2003-11-04/commentary.html" rel="nofollow">"he is anti-abortion -- with no exceptions"</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the Wikipedia pages for other U.S. Representatives, they usually don't go into the political beliefs of the officeholders. The few times they do, the mentions tend to be brief and are not characterized as "controversial", unless, like with <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynthia_McKinney_087e.html" title="Cynthia McKinney">Cynthia McKinney</a>, a controversy over the views made national news. Even then, "controversial" doesn't get called out in a heading.</p>

<dd>None of the other Representatives from Lousisiana have a policy positions section of any kind. None have their specific positions on any political issume mentioned. Out of the entire House delegations of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, abortion is mentioned only in two other pages. One of those is for the House Majority Leader (and his approach to exceptions is not detailed), in the other, abortion is mentioned en passant. The comparative emphasis relative to the other Representatives seems, if not non-neutral, at least disproportionate.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps more should be done to add more information to other member pages in Congress. Education is never a bad thing and the more people can know about a person, the better informed they can be about who is representing him/her.</dd>

Given that general approach to issues in other Representatives' pages, putting this particular Representative's abortion position in a section with a heading that declares it "controversial", with repeated references cited, certainly gives an impression of saying "Can you believe he thinks this!", rather than a simple attempt to inform. That the choice of wording in the entry is the same as that used by political opponents, and is one that the Representative objected to, the impression is even stronger.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Bobby Jindal does not object to the label of "no abortions, no exceptions". I cited that fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you go back in the history and look at my initial posting of Jindal's policy positions you will see that I stated his stance on abortion in one line and one line only.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason I posted the references to prove that he, in fact, supports that policy position is because other people kept editing those statements out as not being factual.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would say that moving the quotes about his stance on abortion to the talk page and just saying "jindal supports a policy of no abortions with no exceptions" would be an acceptable edit. In fact, I will probably do that now to get rid of the perception of "I cannot believe he believes this".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I described my feelings on the term "controversial" earlier in this page. Stating that something is controversial is not taking a stance for or against that position. I could say "the death penalty is a controvercial stance" and you would not know if I am pro or anti death penalty.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Calling something controversial in one enty and not calling it controversial in other entries suggests that there is a unique degree of controversy where it is so labeled. I note both <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_DeLay_86e9.html" title="Tom DeLay">Tom DeLay</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_Jackson_Lee_edb5.html" title="Sheila Jackson Lee">Sheila Jackson Lee</a> have abortion mentions and sections on controversy in their entries, yet the abortion positions of both are not mentioned in the controversy sections.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, in general, that controversial is not a necessarily loaded term. But calling out Jindal's abortion position as a "controversial policy position", when the abortion stance for every other Representative in Louisiana and the bordering states is either unmentioned or not described as controversial, implies that Jindal's position is uniquely controversial.</dd>

I'd recommend eliminating the word "controversial", and reduce the discussion of his position to "He opposes almost all abortions, with only a partial exception for proceedures to save the life of the mother that result in termination of the pregnancy."</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I cannot reduce the abortion position to anything other than his publically stated stance. To do otherwise would not be keeping the article factual. I will probably word it in 2 sentances. Saying he supports "no abortions, no exceptions" but does not include those pregnancies terminated by the "double effect" in his definition of abortion.</dd>

<p>The wording was changed, removing the endorsement of the Republican Party and stating his endorsement by Republicans and Democrats. The discussion that took place at that time was that the state party would typically not endorse a candidate if there are other Republican candidates in the race. The fact that they endorsed Jindal when Mike Rogers was still in the race was a change. Stating that Democrats supported Jindal while Mike Rogers was still in the race just doesnt make sense.</p>

<p>He may very well be the most popular Republican candidate and the Republican frontrunner in the 2007 Governors race. However, is this something that occured after Katrina/Rita.

<p>Basically, I am asking for a source for the statement showing some polling data that he is the "most popular Republican" in Louisiana and that he is the "frontrunner in the 2006 Election". I also want to see why Hurricane Katrina and Rita would have anything to do with said polling data.</p>

<p>A section was entered showing several votes in the 110th congress (but only those where he voted with the Democratic party line... neglecting those where he voted against the Democrats). If we include all votes, these sections can get very lengthy.</p>
<p>I removed the editorial comment where the person made the claim that Bobby Jindal has "bipartisan credentials". That sort of thing violates WP:NPOV, since one persons "bipartisans credentials" could be another persons "political maneuvering". I think that the sections stating his votes should be removed because there are already webpages committed to showing what Bobby Jindal voted on and when. This wikipedia page already points to those pages. Someone who is concerned about Bobby Jindal's record has every opportunity to use the links provided for them.</p>
<p>I will wait at least a week and if there is no objection I will delete both sections on the congressional votes. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 07:30, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Votes on particularly notable or controversial bills could be mentioned in the positions section. His voter against embrionic stem-sell research, for instance, is related to his strong pro-life position on abortion. But the seperate sections need to go as they duplicate information better listed elsewhere (like the House web site). In fact, seeing your comment, I am going to boldly remove them right now. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 13:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't remember specifically which information I used; this was an edit I did almost a year ago. I know it was information concerning his early life and career before the 2003 gubernatorial election. I'm sorry I can't be more specific; I was new to Wikipedia then, and didn't always provide full footnotes.

<dd>I agree that we shouldn't be restricted to online sources, especially if certain information is only available in "print". I also see no policies/guidelines requiring only sources that can be linked to. With that said, I am fairly confident that any information included in that printed document could also be found in several of the pages that have been linked to by the other contributors and see no reason to include a redundant source. The article will also be "cleaner" without unlinked sources. If you can find that one peice of information that was found in that reference that is not referenced other places then by all means, that source should be kept. However, if you cannot find the peice of information that was found in that source, i suggest we delete it... because there is no proof that the item is actually a source for this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielZimmerman_2820.html" title="User talk:DanielZimmerman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DanielZimmerman_052a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DanielZimmerman">contribs</a>) 21:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Conservateur added that "Jindal's narrow loss has been cited as an example of the Bradley Effect". I went ahead and provided a link to a webpage that does "cite" this. However, is this an encyclopedic fact? Or is this just the opinion of the user and the webpage I linked to? Can we verify that this was indeed the "Bradley Effect" in play? If we cannot verify it, then should that comment be included in the article? Or is the statement of "fact" that someone has claimed it, regardless of the actuallity of the claim? Thoughts? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 20:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My thoughts . . . It is now sourced that at least one person thought Jindal's narrow loss was due to the Bradley effect. However, as the source cited seems to be a political blog (and not an especially notable one, unless I'm wrong), I don't think it should be in the article. To me, it comes down to this--why is it notable that some random person out there thinks this? If I can see that it isn't just some random person, then I'll favor having it in the article. I mean, lots of people can say things on the internet. If it was in a major newspaper editorial column or in <i>Time</i> or something like that, then that would be completely different. Right now it doesn't seem especially notable. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 10:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I reject the concept of notability in the discussion of what should be in articles, I still removed the information from the article. On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bradley_Effect" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bradley_Effect" rel="nofollow">Bradley effect talk page</a> I showed data that proved that Jindal's loss was not an example of the Bradley effect, so I removed the information there and here. To be fair, this article wasn't claiming that the loss WAS because of the bradley effect, it just stated that some people believe it to be an example of the bradley effect. However, citing those people here would seem to take away from the encyclopedic content of wikipedia. Why include the "fact" that people believe incorrect information about the loss? And you are correct, a lot of people say "things" on the internet. That does not automatically qualify them for inclusion in an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 21:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There have been edits back and forth about whether LA01 is "conservative" or "republican". To me, stating that LA01 is a "Republican District" is false. There is a plurality of Democrats in LA01. The fact that they HAVE voted for Republicans who are conservative does not change the voter registration of the district, it just changes the political leanings of the district. I say that it should be reverted back to "Conservative" until voter registration records show a plurality/majority of registered republicans in the district. I will wait to revert it back to give people time to comment. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 08:40, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree--nearly all of the 1st's state legislators are Republican, and the district has not supported a Democrat for president since 1980. More importantly, despite the Democratic plurality, Democrats have not made a serious bid for this district since Bob Livingston won it in that '77 special election. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck ... <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a> 15:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand that the district has voted for Republicans and predominantly so. However, this is an encyclopedia and it is the duty of those who edit the encyclopedia to give facts. I have a problem saying that it is the "most Republican district" when there may very well be another district with a higher percentage of Republicans in it. Basically, I think we would need the statistics to show that the percentage of republicans in the district is higher in LA01 than any other district for someone to assert that it is the "most republican district". Stating that the district has a plurality of Democrats and stating that the district tends to vote for Conservative candidates is the "better" way to say it. To have any other assertion made, we would need to see the hard facts that prove it. Otherwise, the entry becomes unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 05:21, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quoth the article:</p>
<p><i>Jindal was a Hindu but converted to Catholicism in high school at Baton Rouge Magnet High School.</i></p>
<p>It's not clear to me from the high school's article, but generally in the US schools called "magnet" are public schools. Thus, I'm assuming that he didn't convert to Catholicism as a result of religious instruction at high school, though the sentence sort of gives you that impression. I imagine that a couple of things have been conflated -- (a) that he converted to Catholicism while he was of high school age, and (b) that he attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School. I'd like to separate them out to make this clearer, but just wanted to make sure I had my facts straight before doing so. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> (<a href="../../../j/f/r/User_talk%7EJfruh_8e72.html" title="User talk:Jfruh">talk</a>) 21:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say that unless the conversion happened at the school, that you would be correct in making two sentances out of that. Sentance one would be that he attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School and sentance two would be that during high school he converted to Catholicism. And <a href="http://brmhs.ebrschools.org/" class="external text" title="http://brmhs.ebrschools.org/" rel="nofollow">Baton Rouge Magnet High School</a> is a public school. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 20:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
