<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Ross_753a.html" title="Edit section: Television show">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Television show</span></h2>
<p>Ross is best known as the host of the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_television.html" title="Public television">public television</a> series <i>The Joy of Painting</i>, which ran from 1983 to 1995. During each half-hour segment, Ross would instruct viewers in the art of oil painting by painting an entire landscape over the course of the program, usually also providing a running commentary on the process as he worked. He was known in particular for, like his predecessor William Alexander, frequently <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphization.html" title="Anthropomorphization">anthropomorphizing</a> the inanimate subjects of his paintings and describing them in such terms as "happy little trees" and "pretty little mountains". Ross acknowledged that the appearances of the landscapes he painted (typically mountains, lakes, and snow and log cabin scenes) were strongly influenced by his years living in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where he was stationed for the majority of his Air Force career.</p>
<p>He repeatedly stated on the show his belief that everyone had inherent artistic talent and could become accomplished artists given time, practice, and encouragement, and to this end was often fond of saying, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy little accidents." Ross later founded his own successful line of art supplies and how-to books, and also offered painting classes taught by instructors trained in the "Bob Ross method". When asked about his laid-back approach to painting and eternally calm and contented demeanor, he once commented: "I got a letter from somebody here a while back, and they said, 'Bob, everything in your world seems to be happy.' That's for sure. That's why I paint. It's because I can create the kind of world that I want, and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Shoot, if you want bad stuff, watch the news."</p>
<p>Ross utilized the <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wet-on-wet.html" title="Wet-on-wet">wet-on-wet</a> oil painting technique, in which paint is applied on top of still-wet paint (as opposed to the more traditional method of waiting for each paint layer to dry before applying more paint). Combining this method with the use of large painting knife and fan <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brush.html" title="Brush">brushes</a> allowed Ross to paint trees, water, clouds and mountains in a matter of seconds. On the show he often credits <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Alexander_%28television_painter%29_bc37.html" title="William Alexander (television painter)">Bill Alexander</a> for teaching him this method.</p>

<p>In March 2006, The Bob Ross Inc. announced plans to license rights to develop a Bob Ross video game. At the time, it was reported that AGFRAG Entertainment Group would receive the license and planned on developing the game for PC, the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_DS_b235.html" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a>, and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s next-generation video game console, the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>. The Wii was chosen because its <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_Remote_0463.html" title="Wii Remote">Wii Remote</a> is unique in its ability to sense 3D control, allowing the player to use the remote like a paintbrush, aptly suited to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joy_of_Painting_8f28.html" title="The Joy of Painting">The Joy of Painting</a></i>.</p>
<p>At first, the announcement was believed to be an early <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a> joke. However, it was confirmed by several websites including <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>.com, the official Bob Ross website and the <a href="http://www.agfrag.com" class="external text" title="http://www.agfrag.com" rel="nofollow">AGFRAG homepage</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, it was reported that the game had been cancelled. A short while later, however, the company announced that those reports were inaccurate, and that they were looking for another development company, as AGFRAG had left the project. <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/bob-ross/bob-ross-game-still-on-folks-219920.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/bob-ross/bob-ross-game-still-on-folks-219920.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Stated that his favorite part of painting was cleaning the brush (specifically, the act of knocking paint off the brush head by rapping it against the easel frame). Bob Ross can be seen smiling and even laughing out loud consistently during this practice as he, in his words, "Beat the devil out of it".</li>
<li>Appeared in two self-parodying promos for <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> which featured him working on paintings of the MTV logo and describing MTV as "all fluffy white clouds" and "the land of happy little trees".</li>
<li>Stated in one episode of <i>The Joy of Painting</i> that he did not wear shoes to school until the sixth grade (Series 15, Episode 10).</li>
<li>Though he never studied at any upper-level design academies or fine arts schools, he did admit that he had attended art school "as a pup" (contrary to the popular belief that he never received any formal artistic training).</li>
<li>Although he adopted and rehabilitated numerous wild animals, Bob Ross did not believe in keeping them as pets. He released every animal back into its natural habitat, despite his loving bond with said critters.</li>
<li>Bob Ross was a vegetarian.</li>

<li>Ross was spoofed on the Fox television show <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i>. In the opening of the second season episode "<a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteen_Minutes_of_Shame_e1f4.html" title="Fifteen Minutes of Shame">Fifteen Minutes of Shame</a>," he paints a bush and tells the viewer, "We're just gonna put a happy little bush down in this corner, and that'll just be our little secret. But if you tell anybody that bush is there, I will come to your house and I will cut you!"</li>
<li>On an episode of the cult series <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_Hill_b2c9.html" title="Mission Hill">Mission Hill</a></i>, main characters Andy, Jim and Posey are watching a parody of Bob's show in the same manner one would watch a game show or sporting event. Jim and Andy ask "Palette knife or fan brush?" Posey yells out "Thin it with turpentine!" When Bob pauses on screen wondering what to paint next, Andy chants "A happy little tree" and Bob paints a happy little tree. Andy kisses the screen, proclaiming "I love you man!"</li>
<li>On the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dana_Carvey_Show_a8bf.html" title="The Dana Carvey Show">Dana Carvey Show</a></i>, Ross is portrayed by cast member <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Smigel_b135.html" title="Robert Smigel">Robert Smigel</a> painting a double portrait of the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menendez_brothers.html" title="Menendez brothers">Menendez brothers</a> embedded into a frosty mountain typical of Ross's style while saying, "They're going away for a long time; give 'em a tree."</li>
<li>The Seattle Television show <i><a href="../../../a/l/m/Almost_Live_bea6.html" title="Almost Live">Almost Live</a></i> spoofed Ross in a holiday skit. Comparing the shades of colors he is using, he remarked that they reminded him of "big, fat Uncle Ed" choking on a turkey.</li>

<li>The May 22, 2006 episode of <i>Attack of the Show</i> included a trailer for a nonexistent movie called <i>The Bob Ross Code</i> (a spoof of <i>The DaVinci Code</i>). It discusses how Bob Ross left clues in his painting concerning "Happy Little Twees."</li>

<li>Mexican comedian <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenio_Derbez_6e5b.html" title="Eugenio Derbez">Eugenio Derbez</a> has a character called Bob Atroz (atroz meaning "atrocious"). His sketches consist of Bob teaching how to paint and saying things about the "happy trees" and "happy clouds" while cursing, all in a soothing voice. In these sketches, Derbez speaks English and viewers hear a "translation" in Spanish that isn't totally accurate and tones down some of the things Bob said.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Trip_ac0e.html" title="Road Trip">Road Trip</a></i>, a motel clerk (<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Dick_8b16.html" title="Andy Dick">Andy Dick</a>) watches <i>The Joy of Painting</i> behind the reception desk, and attempts to imitate Ross using a ballpoint pen and a pad of paper.</li>
