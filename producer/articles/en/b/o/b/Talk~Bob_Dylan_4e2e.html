<p>I feel that this is a very exhaustive article regarding Mr. Dylan but in my opinion I feel that it should be condensed. Also, some of the paragraphs are EXTREMELY long and could possibly be broken up into subparagraphs. Doing so would make the article more aesthetic and easier to read.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrillwhite_fb55.html" title="User:Terrillwhite">Terrillwhite</a> 09:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don’t agree. This article has just been through exhaustive review whether it’s still worthy of Featured Article status. Consensus verdict was ‘keep’ (by a slim majority). Review looked at structure, quality of prose etc. One comment by administrator <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> was that some one sentence paragraphs should be eliminated, not that paragraphs were too long.

<dd>I also don't agree. I just had a bad experiance with the John Smith entry on Wikipedia. It was all broken up into different periods, so instead of just reading one long article, I had to read four long articles. If you think that breaking it up keep the fragments short, think again. Infromed readers would take it upon themselves to expand each article and provide new information, so the articles would blow up at a quick rate. By having a long article now, readers are less motivated to add small pieces of information then they would be if there were, say, six shorter articles detailing seperate periods of Mr. Dylan's life. I think it should be kept the way it is. -Notahippie76</dd>

<dd>Totally disagree. If Wikipedia writers were to robotically adhere to these injunctions (which, by the way, are almost all subjective guidelines, *not policies*) no one would read our articles because they would have all the personality and sparkle of printouts produced by machine and proofed by hidebound comittees. Thank goodness we have writers willing to stand up to this sort of Sophist browbeating and to go on including interesting, insightful original prose. Yes, I said <b>original</b>. Many, like "Extraordinary Machine", conflate original prose with "original research" and are on a mission to destroy their mistaken target... Also, each and every thought in an article, particularly in a non-sci/tech article like this one, does not require a citation. To do so would be to compile towers of needless references that bloat the byte length and, when inline, seriously interfere with the movement of the eye along the line. The Wikipedia writer has room to bring in his own thoughts and observations, so long as they make no sweeping, value judgments on the subject's life and career divorced from the public's POV. In the total absence of these thoughts and observations, once again, you will end up with a lifeless document that literally may as well have been compiled by machine... Perhaps Extraodinary Machine, who is so concerned about being "encyclopedic", would do well to read and reflect upon the first sentence in Britannicaa's Dylan article, which reads: "Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan sold more than 58 million albums, wrote more than 500 songs recorded by more than 2,000 artists, performed all over the world, and set the standard for lyric writing." Now-- you <b>know</b> Ex Mach and many others like him would jump all over that sentence if it had been written here rather than in the Enc. Brit., screaming POV! and deleting it until their index fingers went blue. Yet it is the lead in from the most recognized encyclopedia of our times. Really - think about it. Arts, Entertainment and Humanities subjects are qualitatively different from Science, Math, Tech and the other subjects Wikipedia first cut its teeth on. Let's show some subtlety and intelligence here. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 04:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Encyclopedic Britannica comparison of Dylan to Shakespeare would probably be considered POV by a handful of people until a reference was cited, which could be easily done, then no one would touch it. As a matter of fact, you just cited a reference, so post it if you don't believe me. As for the rest of the excerpt, do you consider "Dylan sold more than 58 million albums, wrote more than 500 songs recorded by more than 2,000 artists, performed all over the world, and set the standard for lyric writing" to be objective facts or "interesting, insightful original prose"? Looking at the recent history of this article, I see that your major contributes to it lately have been deleting readers' requests for citations, and have even gone so far as to delete citations people have provided. All I can say is if you don't like Wikipedia's policy on original research, stop trolling and try Geocities; the username dylanisg0d!!! might still be available. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoballyn_153b.html" title="User:Roballyn">Roballyn</a> 03:40, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is just a silly response and I should let it stew and stink in isolation. But I have to point out that the portion of the Enc. Brit. quote that, more than any other portion, would bring on the withering attacks of the OR fanatics is "set the standard for lyric writing". A simple, honest and true statement like that would never survive in Wikipedia because of these people, unless it were in the form of a quote frm a recognized authority (in other words, one of these hallowed "citations"). But Wikipedia is not, and should not be, Wikiquote, so stop trolling to make it so... Your 'Tangled Up In Blue' reaction, described by you below, is even more ridiculous. I never asserted that I, JDG, declare "Tangled' one of Dylan's 3 best songs. I wrote that it is included in many lists, formal and informal, as among the top 3. I have seen so many editors like "Roballyn", who otherwise seem possessed of generally normal intelligence, suddenly lose their ability to reason when this issue comes 'round. For the hundredth time: this is not the editor describing or putting forth his own position—it is the editor describing the public's, or a particular audience's position, as documented in citable sources... Finally, on the dylanisg0d tripe: If you cared to isolate my contributions to this article (including attempted contributions) you would find some of the most critical statements of both the man and his work made during the article's construction. Some of them were summaries of professional criticism and, yes, some sprung from what I am calling "original prose". It's a shame most of these statements have been shown the off-ramp.... And finally finally, I invite you to submit this article for peer review and for reconsideration as a FA. Like many before you, you'll be roundly rebuffed. This article, due primarily to <a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">user:GWO</a>, was one of the first non sci/tech FA, has been included in every stable WP release, and is among the top 5 or so of all WP articles in positive reviews/mentions outside of WP.

<dd>Yeah, I have to agree. I remember reading on here that "Tangled Up In Blue" is considered to be one of Dylan's three best songs and thinking what a silly statement that was. I really believe that this article should be peer reviewed and reconsidered for featured article status, mainly because I'd personally like to see it cleaned up a little bit. I've seen people complain that certain statements in this article don't do their subject justice. That's not really the point here.

<p>Pretty obviously Wikipedia has changed somewhat since Mr.Dylan's article reached prominence. Today's editors have hammered out guidelines and policies to fit a wide range of articles. One of the mainstays is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which states, <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability</b></i>. Briefly, if a statement appears in an article which an editor is fairly sure has never been published, then said editor may remove the unpublished statement. An alternative is to place {{Cite}} (Citation needed) immediately after the questionable statement. Another alternative is to copy and paste the statement to the discussion page for discussion and citing. This is insurance of good, reliable information. This is also insurance against individuals coming to Wikipedia to toot their own horn. In this Dylan article, for example, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> would prevent a close friend of Dylan's from editing the article and inserting unpublished, unknown information about him. It also acts as a brake to personal <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a> by an editor who would exaggerate good information. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 01:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The opening section compares Dylan to Stephen Foster, Irving Berlin, Woody Guthrie, and Hank Williams. I'm not a musicologist but (weasel term) it seems to me (/weasel term) that have been a few important musicians that were not white. Shouldn't we add someone like Muddy Waters or Miles Davis to the comparison to broaden the scope and avoid ethnocentrism? -Tom</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. When Dylan published his "Writings and Drawings" volume in 1972, he dedicated it to two people: Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 10:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement currently reads "His enduring contributions to American song are often compared, in fame and influence, to those of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Foster_7a97.html" title="Stephen Foster">Stephen Foster</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Berlin_13c5.html" title="Irving Berlin">Irving Berlin</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Guthrie_66d5.html" title="Woody Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Williams_0e2e.html" title="Hank Williams">Hank Williams</a>." What all of those artists (except Williams, to my knowledge) have in common is that they have single-handedly penned several songs that are American standards today. Although Waters, Davis, and Johnson are certainly influential, their work is known primarily among enthusiasts and fellow musicians, while just about every child in America knows at least one song by Foster, Berlin, and Guthrie. Besides, the point of the statement is not to promote the artists mentioned, but to make a point about Dylan's music. Plugging more names into it "to broaden the scope and avoid ethnocentrism" is definitely ill-advised. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoballyn_153b.html" title="User:Roballyn">Roballyn</a> 05:32, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You suggest the reason that Foster and Berlin are listed is that "every child in America knows at least one song by Foster, Berlin...". But how many of those children (and adults) of America could tell you that Foster and Berlin were the ones who wrote the songs. We are currently assuming readers will realize who those people are and the magnitude of their work by name association, not by having them listen to and recognize a musical tune they wrote. Since we are listing names of musicians, and not providing audio samples, I think Miles Davis would be a better inclusion. I think far more people know the NAME "Miles Davis", even if those same people know more melodies by Foster or Berlin. -Tom</dd>

<dd>As I've said, "the point of the statement is not to promote the artists mentioned, but to make a point about Dylan's music." Name recognition is not important here. The reader is not assumed to know any more about the artists mentioned than they are to know about Dylan himself. What do you think this article and all its <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">blue</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words.html" title="Words">words</a> are for?&#160;;) Look, if you really want to see non-write musician on the list, you might want to start by suggesting an actual <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a> known for one of more songs, like <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Marley_60be.html" title="Bob Marley">Bob Marley</a>.

<dd>"The reader is not assumed to know any more about the artists mentioned than they are to know about Dylan himself." So what's the point of listing the names at all then? If there's a good chance, as you acknowledge, that the reader doesn't even know who the people we are comparing Dylan to are, why make a comparrison at all? I thought a comparrison served the purpose of given context. It seems pointless to give context if the context being developed is unknown, or unnecesarily esoteric. You're right, I don't listen to much jazz, but I still know who Miles Davis is, unlike Foster or Berlin. Maybe the difference of opinion here is because I'm looking at the opening as a way of suggesting that Dylan played a strong role in transforming our music and culture, while others are suggesting he writes catchy songs that we whistle at work. Is the primary impact of Dylan a cannon of recognizable songs, or the lasting effect of those songs on music and culture in general? -Tom</dd>

<dd>I have never heard of Foster and I have no real idea of Berlin. Looking at their articles, I can understand the reason why this is. I am equally uncertain of what constitutes an "American standard". I do know that Dylan's influence extended far outside of his own country and that his style was (and still is) somewhat unique — although heavily influenced by Guthrie by his own admission. Comparing him with Foster and Berlin or, indeed, limiting any comparison to only American artists would not be to this article's benefit. -- <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlias_Flood_895d.html" title="User:Alias Flood">Alias Flood</a> 03:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If they don't, it certainly is no hardship to click on the blue words to find out, especially if they are considered important enough to place in the opening lines of the article! I agree that the recognition of Dylan's music is more comparable with recognition of Berlin's or Foster's than with that of Davis. It makes no sense to include a less-valid comparison simply for the sake of having a token non-white on the list. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplejuicefool_3159.html" title="User:Applejuicefool">Applejuicefool</a> 14:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are probably four or five big banner disclaimers that could be fairly applied to the article; I'm not sure that there is a Wikipedia content policy that this article isn't violating.

<dd>It looks like one or more anon hooliganish guys came arounnd and put up two tags, NNPOV and WEASEL, and you decided to blow away one and keep weasel. On the strength of the vote above, I think it's fair to have no such tags at present... About your "there are probably four of five big banner disclaimers that could be fairly applied to the article"... which ones, and why? This article has been cited for excellence many times over and I really don't see these violations. The biggest drawback right now is the lack of new-style references (with the &lt;ref&gt; tag), but that will be addressed shortly. The article was selected by committee for inclusion in the Version 0.5 release of Wikipedia, pretty much the highest accolade an article can receive. Only a subset of FAs are selected for this release, so the selection of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> makes this a kind of beyond-FA article. Hard to argue with that... In light of these facts and on the authority of the poll above, I'm again removing the current (weasel) tag put there by SECProto.. SEC, two tags (NNPOV and weasel) <i>were</i> put there by anon fly-by-nighters. JKelly knocked it down to one and says he is "not invested in the tag staying there". If you want to go against the Version 0.5 committee and the voters above, you're free to put it back. But I would expect an in-depth account here describing your reasoning. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 11:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not going to do it, largely because I don't think that they are helpful in general, and especially in the specific. Incidentally, I am under the impression that the 0.5 criteria is the importance of the subject, not the quality of the article. I am certain that articles that are not FAs have a 0.5 template on them (see <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_of_Ireland_c399.html" title="Talk:Republic of Ireland">Talk:Republic of Ireland</a> for instance). <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 20:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do not believe each and every thought or word needs an inline citation, or that Wikipedia should turn into Wikiquote (quotes can be paraphrased anyway), but I do think that statements like "Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona" certainly do need citing. Who said this? Was it Dylan himself, a friend or family member, a biographer? We're not supposed to "bring in our own thoughts and observations"; that's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If the <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">peacock</a> terms present on this article really do reflect "the public's, or a particular audience's position, as documented in citable sources", then it shouldn't at all be difficult to cite reliable sources supporting them. Otherwise, stuff like "playful sense of humor that has often reappeared over the years" and "Whether through necessity or opportunism, Dylan used an extended convalescence to escape the pressures of stardom" looks like the author's own interpretations of events in Dylan's life and career.</li>
<li>What the Encyclopedia Britannica has written about Dylan is neither here nor there in the development of this article. NPOV is a <a href="../../../p/a/g/WP%7EPAG_9804.html#Key_policies" title="WP:PAG">key policy</a> on Wikipedia, and is non-negotiable: we're here to present the facts in an unbiased and neutral way. You have no right to tell readers of this article that Dylan is an "undeniably a fine interpreter of traditional songs" or that <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> is a "classic record" and "a successful mix". I don't think anybody likes having somebody's personal opinion (and yes, that is just opinion) being presented as fact; it's at best presumptuous, and at worst insulting. We've managed to create some truly excellent articles that abide by this policy, and I don't see why this article (or any about arts-related topics) should be treated differently just because of the subject matter. Statements like "Hard-working elder statesman" are simply unacceptable. NPOV is also a requirement for any featured article; if the article stays as it is, it will likely be defeatured and have a lower chance of appearing on any future physical release of Wikipedia. If you want it to be kept featured, I think you should accept that it is not up to FA standard in its current state. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 22:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Minor edit to the all important opening sentence. Bob is currently a disc jockey. I added this to what he is. Someone took it off. Why? 86.139.53.220 21:25, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure who took it off, it might have been me. This is because he is not best know for being a disc jockey - it's not where he got his start or what he is most famous for. Many famous people might take up celebrity golfing when they get older, but it's not what they're most known for, so it wouldn't say that in their introduction. Equally, he is not best known for his disc jockeying, so it doesn't really belong in the introduction. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 13:47, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with SecProto. Bob Dylan is, and has been, many things, but you don't need to mention them all in the opening sentence. The opening sentence (I'm just pondering here) should really sum up why this person is being included in Wikipedia, ie what is <i>notable</i> about him, and everything else should get shunted to the body of the article. Of course, I'm saying this without having consulted the official WP policies on intro text, but I imagine that this is a reasonable rule-of-thumb. After all, if Bob had retired and was now working as a bank teller, we wouldn't describe him as "an American singer-songwriter, author, musician, poet and bank teller". <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeborkman_778f.html" title="User:Leeborkman">Leeborkman</a> 05:27, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, this external links collection is kind of horrendous. Not in that they are bad links, but it is just very large and has a fair proportion of redundancy. I'll go through the ones that I think are not necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Boblinks" - Very good links and concert info. Contains links to many of the sites which are on here, so it could be used as a sort of directory so that they don't all need to be on this page.</li>
<li>"Bob Dylan's American Journey" - This is a link to some dead page on the "experience music project" website, which seems to me to be a commercial site, and not a very interesting one at that. The actual museum or whatever is probably quite good, but this link doesn't belong.</li>
<li>"Bobdylanroots.com" - Might be interesting, but has not been updated in 5 or 6 years. (as far as i can tell at least.) I find it difficult to see the significance.</li>
<li>"It's not a house it's a home" - This site is terrific. But I don't know why it is called this? I don't see that name anywhere on the site. Great site, just needs retitling.</li>
<li>"Dusty old fairgrounds" - stopped updating in 2004, and all it's info is redundant in that it is all found in the next link:</li>
<li>"DVDylan" - site is no longer called that, it is called His Bobness Info. It lists setlists for i think every concert he has done, and is still updated quickly after every concert. Just needs to be retitled.</li>
<li>"Searching for a Gem" - A useful site to a very select crowd. Not many people are going to be in search of them. So i don't think it really belongs in a group of links which we (me?) is trying to cut down.</li>
<li>"Project '74" - doesn't exist, and if it did, how much more than the other concert recording sites could it have?</li>
<li>"1978 Tour Guide" - site was started in 2003, and was last updated in 2003. Doesn't seem to contain any more information on the 78 tour than the other concert directory (his bobness info).</li>
<li>"The Gospel Project" - contains setlists from about 30 concerts in 1979, along with a lot of detailed information about them. But again, it looks to have not been updated since 2002, and is only interesting to a very select crowd (not the average wikipedia biography crowd. Only the very complete collector).</li>
<li>"Bob dylan discography at rwin.nl" - a very incomplete discography, apparently with the same thing as the official site&#160;:except less complete. Doesn't even include bootleg 7.</li>
<li>"Olof's Files" - the first one is fine, the second one has gotta go. It is a direct link on the first "olof's files" page. It is on the same site, and has the same information? people will be able to find it for themselves.</li>
<li>"tangled: a recording history of bob dylan" - a purely commercial site, dedicated to selling a book. no information whatsoever.</li>
<li>"hisbobness.info" - link is already linked further up, under another name.</li>
<li>the magazines section - "the bridge" and "judas!" don't appear to contain much information on the actual websites; I'm sure the magazines themselves would deserve a link if you could do such a thing, but a link to their website doesn't really fit.</li>
<li>"Cambridge Unversity library site" - you could do the same at any library site by typing "bob dylan" into the keywords or subject space. Not really needed here.</li>
<li>"Bibliography" and "Academic series: bob dylan all alone on a shelf" - these sites are probably notable, but need some sort of explanation, such as "this site has a list of books that have had bob dylan as a major portion of their subject" or somehting. I don't know much about the sites, so I can't write them.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous section - several of these are quite good (google archive of rec.music.dylan, the dylan mailing list archives.) Several others are just too minor to be important (PBS masters site, which basically advertises no direction home; the copyright free review of no direction home; the collection of bob dylan quotes (that's what wikiquote is for!); covers of bob dylan songs by others (its on the bjourner site, which is the same site as the first two olof's files links. redundant link.) ). Other links are interesting (his youth in hibbing one, kind of gives another perspective.) and should stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the links section has a lot of redundancy and unneccessary/unnotable links. I'm not a big follower of WP:EL or anything like that, I just think the list is long and unmanaged and needs some work. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 13:27, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a complete mess. it has almost no references, changing the header for the list of books about Dylan won't wash. WP:BIO requires that sources for derogatory comments about living people be well-sourced and cited, saying that BD stole records from his friends and didnt live up on his record contract are derogatory.

<dd>This isn't wikiquote. If you're unfamiliar with some of the more frequently referenced works in this article, perhaps you should find articles in which you have greater expertise. Direct citations after every statement would make this article a mockery of the featured article it once was. I'd completely revert all of these references, particularly since they are hindering more progress in the article, but I don't want to establish an all-out edit war.</dd>
<dd>But seriously - educate yourself before you start this - Bob Dylan openly admits to "borrowing" records on last year's documentary. It is also very accurate to say that he did not live up to his record contract. This, in fact, is why the 1973 album "Dylan" was released of mostly outtakes - to fulfill his contract by releasing a final album.</dd>
<dd>And if this is some personal battle between you and JDG, as it would seem from below, please take this to some video game, or something else - this is no place for it.</dd>

<dd>I'm glad you are responsive. I see that your editing difference does show a large number of citation needed tags added. Why didn't you simply point to the procedure for requesting a citation which my previous-to-this-posting points to and removed all 89 tags? The tag, after all, has a specific purpose and article disruption is not the purpose. The purpose is to ask for a citation or two, not to disrupt an otherwise fine article. I'm glad you took responsibility for what appeared to be your insertion of 89 'citation needed' sticker, but please leave them out and insist that an editor who requests a citation do so by approved procedures rather than by disrupting an article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 02:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's nothing inherently disruptive about asking for a citation for every expression of personal opinion during an article review. There is no "approved procedure" other than seeing something that needs citing and asking for a cite. I don't think that the tags should be removed, which is why I included them in that complex revert, and why I reverted your stripping of them. Instead of worrying about whether the tags were applied correctly, it would be a lot more productive to track down references for statements like "his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment". That should be relatively easy to source. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 02:20, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As one of the early authors, and the only one to stick with the article all the way from `02 to `06, I admit it has needed a sourcing overhaul for quite a while. But this should, without doubt, be happening in a /temp directory. Somebody above mentioned "all the tools being all over the place". Well then the light should be tuned on inside and the garage door closed. It's like changing one's clothes in public. Hundreds of people are reading this while this is going on... Also, it seems that whenever the new sourcing occasions a rewrite of a sentence or paragraph, the writing is quite shaky.. But all-in-all I do wish you success.

<p>Can I ask why "citations are needed" for statements that have been pretty much done to death in every single book ever written on the subject? Do we REALLY need a "citation," for instance, for the young Dylan adopting a Huck Finn persona, and telling tall tales about what he'd done? Doesn't everybody KNOW that? Can we at least assume that regular editors of an article have read one book on the subject?

<dd>Um, I didn't know that. You can't assume readers have read any of the bios published on him. After all, they're coming here to learn about him. However, you might want to bring up your question on <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>'s talk page. My grad school training on citing sources was that if it was in at least 3 reputable books I didn't need to cite it as it can be assumed to be common knowledge. I have no idea if WP follows the same rule of thumb, so you might want to ask there. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 23:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Readind WP:CITE it looks somewhat ambiguous. But it implies that cites are needed for opinions, or for info that someone is likely to dispute. The "citations needed" in this article often do not fall under those categories, like my example above. <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 23:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, many of the "citations needed" are unnessary. I was actually surprised that a lot of the statements that could be disputed were looked over. For instance, "Dylan and Lownds divorced in July 1977, though they reportedly remained in regular contact for many years and, by some accounts, even to the present day." Statements like this (weasel words, probably rumors, and unencyclopedic) are the reason why the POV of this article is being disputed in the first place. I think whomever put all those {fact} temps there should explain his/her criteria for including them if they want to keep them there. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoballyn_153b.html" title="User:Roballyn">Roballyn</a> 00:41, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put the "citations needed" tags in if I saw a factual dispute in the history, if the statement appeared unlikely or needed clarification, or if the statement mixed fact and opinion. I hoped editors would go through them and clean the article up. Good work is going on now, in reaction to it. I think lots more work needs to be done, especially (like I think somebody else said) in making sure the citations match up to the text (Example: the Masked&amp;Anonymous review reference, where the page cited shows the majority of critics had mixed reactions, not overwhelming bad reviews). The problem with mixed fact and opinion isn't really being fixed yet, citing one review doesn't make one critic's opinion a fact. If I googled "Dylan best album" I could probably find a valid cite for a dozen different albums, but the article would really be silly if I put them all in. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmonica_Wolfowitz_6b67.html" title="User:Harmonica Wolfowitz">The editor soon to be formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 19:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Outside opinion here: I do a lot of reviewing at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>. Because Wiki has come under such intense media scrutiny since the Siegenthaler incident, readers need to be able to locate a source for every claim we make. No, IMO we shouldn't assume any facts are a given, and if something is in 3 books anyway, it's not hard to cite. I never knew Dylan assumed a Huck Finn persona, and that is exactly the sort of thing I would want to see cited, because Wiki has been such a source for fueling rumors and speculation. (Wiki conferred upon one controversial political figure a Master's Degree he never had, and no one noticed for several years. Since seeing that, I say everything should be cited.) Wiki readers shouldn't be asked to "take our word for it", even less so when considering that anyone can edit here. Wiki has to have a higher standard on referencing that other information sources, because anyone can edit. Also, I've found that as soon as an article is scrupulously referenced, vandalism and nonsense edits decline, as new editors see the level of referencing required. Personal life, details about divorce? Absolutely need to be cited, because it's personal details that are too easy to get wrong and can be too damaging. I like to see everything cited except "the sky is blue". That's what I'll be looking for on the FAR.

<p><br />
I’m puzzled by the great mess this article has become. By adding roughly 80 x [citation needed] the article looks like a joke. I’m puzzled for 2 reasons.</p>
<p>I looked at Miles Davis, another Featured Article about a major figure in 20th century culture. It’s a good article but it has dozens of sentences that could be regarded as opinion and yet there is not one [citation needed]. For example:</p>
<p>“The quintet’s approach to improvisation came to be known as “time no changes” or “freebop”, because while they retained a steady pulse, they abandoned the chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach.”</p>
<p>I think that’s good, but why does it not need a citation and yet we have [citation needed] next to: “Dylan’s 1978 album <i>Street Legal</i>” was lyrically one of his more complex and absorbing.”&#160;?</p>
<p>The second reason I’m puzzled is that 90% of the [citation needed] can be answered by reference to one of the major Dylan biographies: Sounes, 2001, and Heylin, 2003.</p>
<p>To take 4 random examples from the article:</p>
<p>1. “<i>Street Legal</i>… suffered from a poor sound mix (attributed to his studio recording practices).” [citation needed] Heylin, 2003, pp 480-1 details the defective recording technique of this album.</p>
<p>2. “That summer Dylan stoked the drama of his legacy by performing with…Mike Bloomfield, guitar, Sam Lay, drums, Jerome Arnold, bass, plus Al Kooper, organ, and Barry Goldberg, piano. [citation needed]” Heylin, 2003, pp 208-216 tells the oft repeated story of Dylan’s 1965 Newport set.</p>
<p>3. “The relaxed atmosphere (of Big Pink) yielded renditions of many of Dylan’s favored old songs and some newly-written piece. [citation needed]” Sounes, 2001, pp 222-5 tells the very familiar tale of the Basement Tapes.</p>
<p>4. “In August 1965, at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience who… still demanded the acoustic troubadour of previous years; their reception on September 3rd at the Hollywood Bowl was more uniformly favorable. [citation needed]” Sounes, 2001, pp 189-90 details the Forest Hills and Hollywood Bowl concerts.</p>
<p>If we’re talking about critical evaluation of Dylan’s songs, then Ricks, 2003, and Gray, 2006, contain many insight into lyrics that correspond to this article. For example:</p>
<p>5. “<i>A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall</i> marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with time-honoured folk traditions to create a sound a sense that struck listeners as somehow new and ancient simultaneously. [citation needed]”</p>
<p>Ricks, 2003, pp 329-44 contains this insight and many more.</p>
<p>6. “The Brechtian influenced <i>The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll</i>, a highlight of the album, describes a young socialite’s killing of a hotel maid. Never explicitly mentioning race, the song leaves no doubt that the killer is white, the victim black. [citation needed]”</p>
<p>Ricks, 2003, pp 221-233 makes this point and many others.</p>
<p>Would 80 references to the works of Heylin and Sounes and Ricks enhance the authority of this article? I’m not sure. I’ve added 10 web-based references to this article in the last week but indexing Sounes and Heylin and Ricks may be a step too far. When this article was externally reviewed by The Guardian on 24 October 2005, Derek Barker, editor of leading Dylan magazine Isis rated it 8/10. That shows it’s factually solid.</p>
<p>btw, I’m not brilliant at footnote software but if anyone wants to turn the above points into footnotes for the article, they’re welcome.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge the points Sandy makes above answers some of my puzzlement. (I was writing this while he posted)</p>

<p>More notes: please don't compare to any other current FA. Standards have changed, articles deteriorate, and the FA process allows some articles through that don't meet criteria.</p>
<p>Also, if one book can be used to reference a number of statements, easy: do it. Using named refs makes it very easy to repeat references. End of problem. Don't assume the Wiki reader has read the book: tell them exactly where to find the info.</p>
<p>Why do you need a referece for <i>“Dylan’s 1978 album Street Legal” was lyrically one of his more complex and absorbing.”&#160;?</i> Because that is obviously a POV statement. We need to know if a reliable source said those words; that is, we need a reference, or else the statement is original research and POV. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:50, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I fixed the lead. It now gives the reader an objective sign of Dylan's "stature" as somebody wanted, but it does it with statemetns of fact not unsourced opinions.

<p>I noticed lots of progress&#160;! A couple of comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first reference currently used is from BBC: that's good. But the unfortunate use of cite web obscures the fact that a good reference is used. It comes across in the footnotes as a generic website, rather than a reliable news source. That footnote should give (for example) an author (if available), publication date (BBC always provides), and be refd to BBC news. Using cite news in place of cite web will make the reliability of your sources more apparent to reviewers. I don't like to have to click on a reference to find out if it's a personal website or a reliable source, so please expand citations to full bibliographic style, and use cite news or better templates where appropriate. The strength of your sources will be more apparent if you use a complete bibliographic style. It'stroubling to see BLPs referenced to personal and non-reliable sources, and full entries will remove that doubt.</li>

<p>I recently read a book "Redwing, A Year And A Day" written by a former inmate of a juvenile reformatory in Minnesota. It contained a chapter that details Bob Dylan's arrival there in 1958. This is the first time I had read anything of this nature with regard to his formative years in Minnesota. Could this be Dylan's deep, dark secret of his past and troubled teenage years? My research concerning his life story indicates that this may be something of a revelation. My question would be: Why was this brief period of Dylan's young life not revealed in any previous publication? Perhaps the author (Larry Haugen) could shed some light on this (apparently unauthorized) version of a young Bob Dylan. It would seem to me, that without the inclusion of that portion of his life, any biographical (or autobiographical) account of his life is incomplete.</p>

Clinton Heylin (Bob Dylan, Behind the Shades Revisited, 2003) writes that Dylan may have spent time at a "country club reform school" in Pennsylvania called Devereaux in the summer of 1959. Heylin thinks this episode may have inspired Dylan's song 'The Walls of Redwing' which was recorded for Freewheelin' and released on Dylan's Bootleg Series Vol. 1 -3 (1991). In his liner notes for the Bootleg album, John Bauldie says it's definite Dylan never spent time in Redwing, though Heylin claims Dylan told Al Aronowitz he'd served time in Redwing. (Heylin, p 27-28) The lyrics of 'The Walls of Redwing' can be found on Dylan's website www.bobdylan.com <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 17:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Extraordinary Machine, I’ve reverted the lines about Dylan’s song The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll to their previous formulation because I don’t think your version is quite right. A lot of critics have written about the racial aspect of the song and how it is implicit in the narrative. The point has been made by Gray, Heylin and Marqusee to name just 3 of the critics cited in references and further reading. People have commented on it before Christopher Ricks’s book and after Christopher Ricks’s book. I think it’s valid to suggest that the song works in this way and then give a concrete citation to Ricks because his discussion of the racial angle of Hattie Carroll is particularly good. But to attribute the idea to Ricks alone – as you do in your version – distorts this point. I could also give citations for 5 critics who have called Hattie Carroll a highlight of Dylan’s song-writing career, so I think it is valid to call it a highlight of the album. I've addded some further thoughts on the note I've posted on your User page.

<li>Right, but it would be more in line with Wikipedia policy to introduce the statement with <i>"many sources wrote that the song..."</i>. The song's lyrics are still being interpreted by these people, and it's more opinion than fact that they are about race (the article says it doesn't mention race); therefore, we can't simply state that <i>"the song leaves no doubt that the killer is white, the victim black"</i>.</li>
<li>Providing there's a reference, it's fine to say critics consider the song a highlight of the album; it's not fine, however, to say that it is a highlight of the album, because again it's opinion rather than fact. See <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#A_simple_formulation" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#A_simple_formulation</a>. The same things applies with calling Dylan "hard-working". I left the "elder statesman" statement in because I didn't really know what that meant (or that it implied a POV), but I suppose would make just as much sense to change the header to something like "Later career". <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 14:59, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Someone has posted a list of the episodes Dylan has aired on his radio show. Since Dylan's discography (which is central to understanding his work) has been removed to a separate Wikipedia entry, would that not also be appropriate for Theme Time Radio Hour?

<p>I’ve been trying to add as many citation/references to this article as I can. However, I can only give citation/references for paragraphs I believe are true, or critical opinions I think deserve to be substantiated. In the 1980s section there was a long rambling discussion of Dylan’s religious values in this decade. Administrators have added <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> next to practically every sentence. I can’t supply these references because I basically don’t agree with this paragraph. It treats Dylan’s religious values as though religious commitment arrived in Dylan’s work with Slow Train Coming, and may have departed some time in the 1980s. I think this is a misunderstanding of Dylan. I think his work is drenched in religious imagery and the language of the King James Bible from his earliest recordings to his most recent. Certainly Blowin’ In the Wind and When the Ship Comes In are written in the language of Biblical parables. Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying that I’ve deleted this paragraph, but if an editor wishes to re-instate it and provide the citation/references necessary to substantiate it, they are very welcome. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 10:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Many of the citation needed tags seem to be going overboard - by those same standards we would delist most of the FAs I have read recently, and reject most of the scientific papers I read. Example: "<i>The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, surreal litanies of the grotesque flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar, a rhythm section and Dylan's obvious enjoyment of the sessions.[citation needed]</i>" Surely if Dylan's enjoyment is "obvious" it doesn't need citing? Is it really controversial to say that the songs were in the same vein as the hit single?" I agree. The chief evidence of Dylan's obvious enjoyment is the way he giggles while singing 'Highway 61 Revisited'. I suppose if I continue to scour the extant literature I could find something, but I think <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> has a valid point. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 07:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why has my posting that Dylan is Jewish repeatedly been deleted, when my source/reference is a valid one? The one who deleted it has obviously not taken the time to read through my linked article. I was planning on contributing a lot to Wikipedia, and I do accept constructive criticism, but not plain deletion without warning or discussion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi. Do you have a User name? Are you Lespaul? The only thing I deleted was an edit by Lespaul calling Dylan an American Jewish artist in the first sentence of the lead para. I commented “I’d argue American, rather than American Jewish, in first para.” I read the linked article. Larry Yudelson tries to claim Dylan as a Jewish artist. He’s entitled to his opinion but I don’t think his article is totally convincing. He writes: “Sixty-one biblical references have been counted on the next Dylan album, John Wesley Harding. "All Along the Watchtower" transformed Isaiah's images into a rock hit. But what was a nice Jewish boy singing that "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine"?”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What indeed? There are several websites that claim Dylan as a Christian artist. This article properly states that Dylan was born to Jewish parents who were part of a close-knit Jewish community in Duluth &amp; Hibbing. Dylan uses Old Testament references. He uses New Testament references. He also references Egyptian &amp; Greek mythology, Shakespeare &amp; romantic poetry in his songs. Above all, he’s steeped in the language &amp; the history of the blues &amp; country music &amp; gospel music. I think it’s false to characterise Dylan as a Jewish artist or a Christian artist. That limits him. That’s my opinion. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 14:18, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I’ve toned down fulsome tribute to Ramblin’ Jack Elliott’s massive influence on Dylan. Partly, because pre Chronicles Dylan was not so respectful towards Elliott. In Izzy Young’s Journal from October 20, 1961, Young writes down Dylan’s words: “I’ve been with Jack Elliott. Jack hasn’t taught me any songs. Jack doesn’t know that many songs. He’s had a lot of chances.” (Published in “Younger Than That Now: The Collected Interviews with Bob Dylan,” ed. James Ellison, New York: Thunder’s Mouth Press, 2004, p.12) In Scaduto, Dave Van Ronk recalls Dylan rolling around the floor helpless with laughter on discovering Elliott’s real name was Elliott Adnopoz. (Scaduto p. 67). I can find no authoritative reference to Dylan’s early concert being billed as ‘Son of Jack Elliott’. Surely a cite/ref is necessary for this ‘fact’. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 15:57, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello there, hope I'm doing this right, forgive me if not, I'm a newbie. I did the Jack addition to the Bob article. Thanks for your attention and editing of my contribution, it was a surprise that unseen angels had fluttered and fussed and fixed my hammerings while I slept. I'm quite chuffed to have made an addition that was allowed to let stand - it reaffirmed my faith in the wiki principle. Now, to specifics. First, the "Son of Jack Elliott" question. I know I saw this in a bio way before the internet, haven't had time to check my books. Nonetheless, Google gives 92 references albeit none with primary sources: <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22son+of+jack+elliott%22+OR+%22son+of+jack+elliot%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=lr%3Dlang_en" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22son+of+jack+elliott%22+OR+%22son+of+jack+elliot%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=lr%3Dlang_en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22son+of+jack+elliott%22+OR+%22son+of+jack+elliot%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=lr%3Dlang_en</a> .

<dd>Secondly, Dylan's dismissive tone towards Jack. This is a topic of long-standing fascination for fans of both men. Their relationship (sporadic -- intervals between meetings can be measured in decades) has always been fragile. Yet they are friends of a sort. The quote above with Bob seething acidic about Jack sounds perfectly accurate and perfectly Bob. Yet at the start, Bob stole a bunch of rare Jack LPs recorded in England from friends so he could learn from them (cf: various Bob bios -- too late in the night for me to dig 'em out, but if you can't, let me know and I will. It's well known.) Furthermore, Mick -- have you read the citation in Chronicles? Bob admits to being gutted by hearing Jack's voice on record. Pulling out a dumb Bob quote like the above is weird -- it suggests unfamiliarity with your flibbertigibbit subject, with all due respect.</dd>

<dd>PS: The Van Ronk story of Dylan helpless with laughter at hearing Jack's real name is one of my favourite Bob/Jack stories. The point of the story is that Bobby Zimmerman's all-American cowboy hard-travellin' hero, pal of Woody, Jack Elliott was a son of Brooklyn NY, and the son of a Jewish big-city doctor. Jack was as much of a self-reinvention as was Bob! Jack was the first self-made man. Zimmerman discovered Adnopoz! No wonder he pissed himself laughing.</dd>

<p>Stanjarin 15:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC) Thanks Mick. Trying the tildes. As a personal observation, Jack was a huge influence on Bob in the early days stylistically. They hung out together and Bob absorbed Woody through Jack's interpretations. Woody was in hospital at this time. And Jack had a more mellow, almost surreal style of laconic rambling banter than Woody... Jack was a friend of the beats -- Kerouac, Ginsberg etc. Kerouac read the entire manuscript of "On The Road" to Jack over a wine-soaked three day period five years before it was published. The influence of Jack's humour is also heard in Arlo Guthrie's 'Alice's Restaurant'. But the BIG difference, and the parting of ways occurred after Bob started writing. Jack is an interpreter historian troubadour, Bob is the poet king of folk, rock and any other music that has words in the last half of the twentieth century. (Jack comes up with amazing stuff quite regularly in the course of a day, but never writes it down.) The humour of the earliest Dylan recordings is influenced by a mixture of Woody and Jack, with the surreal flavourings coming more from Jack. And while this is a page about Bob, I just realised a largely unsung aspect of Jack's life and work: the influence of his sense of humour, which is profound -- it touched Dylan, Arlo, Johnny Cash and many others and I don't think I've seen it defined as such until this very minute. Jack started as a kind of Will Rogers that eventually matured into a sort of a George Burns who occasionally slips a song into his observations of the universe.</p>
<p>Stanjarin 13:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC) I've been unable to find any *documented* primary source of the two "Son of Jack Elliott" stories either, after some effort. I still think they're true, but my belief is of no value to Wikipedia. I'm glad you got me off my butt to do some work rather than simply hand on folklore. Wish I could have brought home the bacon, but so far, no. Thanks for that, I learned something... that seeing mention of something repeatedly doesn't mean it has an actual documented primary source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Stanjarin. Thanks for your honesty. Without documentary corroboration we Wiki editors can’t include material. btw I agree with your interpretation of the story of Dylan rolling across the floor helpless with mirth, on learning Ramblin’ Jack Elliott was really Elliott Adnopoz. Obviously one self-invented Jewish hobo was amused to discover another.

<p>Each year Nobel Prize for Literature receives about 350 nominations for about 200 candidates. The Swedish Academy whittles this down to 5 finalists, then the winner is announced in October.

Dylan has been nominated every year since 1996 by Professor Gordon Ball, of Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Va. Christopher Ricks commented: "I don't think there's anybody that uses words better than he does. But I think his is an art of a mixed medium. I think the question would not be whether he deserves (the Nobel Prize) as an honor to his art.

<p>A paragraph has appeared at end of ‘Recent live appearances and the Never Ending tour’ section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Around 2000, and especially in 2001, Dylan began employing a vocal mechanism, which his fan base has dubbed 'upsinging', during sizable portions of his live show. While 'upsinging', Dylan ends a vocal phrase or phrases with a "high" note, which tends to be the root of whatever chord the progression resolves to at the end of any given measure. This unusual mannerism is unprecedented in the world of popular music. 'Upsinging' remains a part of Dylan's live show to this day. Dylanologist Doug Evans coined the term 'upsinging' after Dylan's 2002 concert at Newport, RI, which was laden with 'upsinging.'</dd>
</dl>
<p>I’m not a musicologist. My hunch is that this paragraph is bullshit, a parody of musicological analysis. I think that as Dylan’s vocal range has diminished dramatically over the last 20 years, he has developed a tendency to go ‘up’ at the end of each line. But I could be wrong. This could be an important insight by another (anonymous) Wiki editor. What do other people think? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 06:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mick, upsinging is a widely known and discussed vocal mannerism of Mr. Dylan's. It dominates his current live performances, taking up as much as a third of his overall vocal performance. Many fans find it quite bothersome and/or upsetting.</p>
<p>Also, Dylan's vocal range didn't significantly diminish until 2003.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear who are you? (This dialogue might be easier if you registered a Username.) I’ve been going to Dylan’s concerts for the last 30 years, I know what upsinging is. I asked Andrew Muir (author of “Razor’s Edge” – well regarded study of Never Ending Tour) his opinion on this passage. He replied:
<dl>
<dd>I think his voice deteriorated after 1981! That was the last real year of singing for me. As for the NET it was well before 2003. The thing with upsinging is all Dylan fans know what it means – that irritating fake emotion sham of raising his voice at the end of the line. I doubt it is a professional musical term but it is shorthand for referring to the abomination!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Did Dylanologist Doug Evans publish his discovery of the term ‘upsinging’ anywhere? Or is it an observation he made to his friends? If the latter, it would be more difficult to attribute to Mr Evans alone. best wishes <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 14:26, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering that Dylan's perceived split/feud with the folk music scene is a significant event in the history of music, something that Martin Scorcese's documentary reinforced and transmitted to a new generation raised on cultural pablum, I thought the article needed a bit more background on what all the fuss was about. This is my first time editing any wikipedia article so thanks for your forebearance. The addition consists of the last paragraph in the Protest and Another Side section (the former last sentence of the section is intact except for an added 'But as' at the beginning).

<dd>Hi AndoDoug. The point you make is an interesting one. Hope you don't mind if I edit it a bit. It is a bit dogmatic in tone: "The folk revival had predicated itself on the belief that life equalled art..." That's one component, emphasised by Georgina Boyes and Greil Marcus. I'm sure there were other factors at work, eg enthusiasm for a good tune. I think Dylan's "historical-traditional music" line is from Marcus rather than Alan Jacobs essay. But your Dylan quote about "roses growing out of people's brains" from Hentoff is great. best wishes <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 15:21, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Mick gold--it's better. The 'historical-traditional music' line is quoted in Marcus and elsewhere but couldn't trace it to a more original source. I do find the last sentence of this paragraph ("As Dylan wrote in the sleeve notes for Bringing It All Back Home, 'i accept chaos. i am not sure whether it accepts me.'") to be quite a tangential thought that doesn't really follow (it used to follow from the quote in the previous paragraph, "...But what of Bobby Dylan?... Only a non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel." As Dylan wrote in the sleeve notes for Bringing It All Back Home, 'i accept chaos. i am not sure whether it accepts me.'" I think it's a bit too slapdash a way of wrapping up the paragraph...</p>

<p>Being that Mr. Dylan has always been one of the most prolific songwriters, his collection of bootlegs is extensive, yet Wikipedia steers for the most part clear of any ascociation with them. The only references to Dylan bootlegs are those that speak of the Bootleg Series. I think some kind of listing of available/notable bootlegs should be put up somewhere, probably as its own article. This does not necesarily mean live bootlegs, it could also mean studio outtakes, unused sessions (like the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> session from May 1, 1970), or other demo tapes (like the Minnesota Hotel Tape from December 22, 1961).

<dd>I Agree, I think that some of his bootleg work is very importain, like the 'Great White Wonder' bootleg, only briefly referenced because it was latter partialy released as the basement tapes. I would like to see not only a listing of bootlegs under, for example a bootleg header or even a compilation and live recordings header aswell as the albums listed in the discography.

<p>"Some of his songs, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'",[1] became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements. Forty years later, his 2001 album "Love and Theft", reached the top five on the charts in the U.S. and the UK. His latest studio album, Modern Times, released on August 29, 2006, became his first US #1 album in thirty years, making him the oldest living person to top the charts at the age of 65."</p>
<p>I assume that this paragrpah was initially written before Modern Times, and then info about that album tagged on the end following it's release? If so, do we need Love &amp; Theft in there at all? It seems the point being made is of Dylan's longevity, so we only need to reference his latest album. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Infinitum_1a6b.html" title="User:Mike Infinitum">Mike Infinitum</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Infinitum_d9a6.html" title="User talk:Mike Infinitum">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mike_Infinitum_41f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mike Infinitum">contribs</a>) 17:12, 4 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I've restored links to 2 websites. Expecting Rain is updated daily &amp; constitutes the best resource for monitoring both Dylan's own activity, and critical commentary on it. It provides links to every major Dylan event in the press, in book publishing, on radio, and TV. This updating is done by a vast &amp; linked array of Dylan fans &amp; scholars. Bob Links provides Dylan set lists &amp; tour itineraries, as well as links to other specialist Dylan websites dealing with Dylan in movies, Dylan interviews, chord transcriptions of Dylan songs, the major archived Dylan features in the serious press. There are over 100 websites dealing with Dylan's lyrics, Dylan's paintings, Dylan's religious beliefs, etc. I believe these 2 sites are the best index &amp; archive of all that Dylan scholarship, some of which is very good. Both these web sites are regarded by serious Dylan scholars as indispensable in terms of Dylan research. In my opinion, and that of every major Dylan scholar I know, they are neither spam nor commercial websites primarily geared to marketing. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 08:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have reinserted the link to the article titled "Come In," She Said, "Ill Give You Shelter From The Storm" which had been wrongly removed at various times in the past. The reasons give for its removal were unfounded under the true Wiki principles, and I will address some of them as follows:</p>
<p>1. Some have said that it is self-serving. It actually falls under the catagory of "obscure" which is acceptable under Wiki policy.</p>
<p>2. Some have said that it is self promoting spam. The site it links to is not at all commercial, nor even solicates donations, as does Wiki, itself.</p>
<p>3. Some have said that it is original research. Yet the facts therein are not only facts of the very basics of the Hebrew language, but the premise of the femininity of the Holy Spirit/Holy Ghost has been long established in the Jewish Kabbalah and other Jewish writings.</p>
<p>Please be considerate of the true principles of a free exchange of ideas by not removing the link without a prior discussion. If it is maliciously removed, this matter will go to arbitration. Anyone7 03:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I reverted your edits because (a) I think Dylan is of only very marginal relevance to gospel music (although this is a debatable point), and (b) the material you linked to is only marginally about Dylan; it is mostly linguistic/religious speculation unrelated to his work. Also, this is a very important Wikipedia article that is already quite long; we do not want to make it longer unnecessarily. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it is valid to mention gospel amongst Dylan's musical resources, since he devoted two controversial albums (in my view, one of them was brilliant) to exploring that genre: Slow Train Coming &amp; Saved. I agree with <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> that website "Shelter From the Storm" is both very obscure &amp; speculative. We should only link most important Dylan websites, and that is not one of them. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 09:28, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>While you both are entitled to your opinions, you both are also subject to being wrong, and misusing the Wiki privileges and principles. There is a book under the Further Reading section titled "Tangled Up in the Bible: Bob Dylan and Scripture," another one called "Hard Rain: A Dylan Commentary," and another called "Bob Dylan and Philosophy." So what gives them weight to be in the article, and not the Shelter link? This is very important point, and deserves to be properly addressed. The Shelter link is inconsequential as far as the length of the article is concerned, and I see that argument as a sham (with all due respect). Brian...'s thought on the relevance of Dylan's work on Gospel music, is a mere opinion, and not based on any thing of weight. I have played his "Christian" songs before some very conservative Christians who would never have thought that Bob Dylan could have written such things, and not only did they like the songs, but loved the thoughts and music in the songs. They were not marginal in their responses, but whole heartedly appreciative of being exposed to the songs. And they were all Gospel singers themselves (about 80 of them, representing over 10 different denominations). Mick's statement that the premise of Shelter being speculative is, in itself, speculative. What evidence does he have that what is said in Shelter is untrue? Who was Bob Dylan talking about in Shelter, when he said "If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born"? Who is the subject of the song Precious Angel, and the others noted in the Shelter link. If you can't give a reasonable answer, and can't disprove what is written in the Shelter link about Hebrew thinking playing very heavily in Bob Dylan's experience and songs, then it is only fair to leave it alone, and let those who may want to investigate the matter themselves do so without obstruction from those who may not be interested in looking deeply into such things, or are already satisfied with what they think. Be fair. Wiki means "anyone," even those whom others may want to bully. I am actually amazed that nobody has removed the "Gospel" genre references I inserted at the beginning of the article. There has been such an ongoing debate in the editing of this article about Dylan religious (Christian) testimony that it took a long time for some to allow the matter to be even marginally represented. Tell me, why do either of you think that of all the editing has been done in the past has no one been honest enough to simply include Gospel as one of the genre he has performed in? Is it bigotry. Some would certainly see it as that way. I am going to reinsert the link now. If anyone feels that it should be removed, let them do it the right way by first discussing the matter. I am reasonable, and I also know by experience that some others are not. I you think you can present a reasonable excuse for suppressing the thoughts in the Shelter link, and that said argument will stand the scrutiny of candid minds, then present the thoughts before removing the link, as such is how that should be done.

<li>I have reverted your changes again. I went back to the link which you added and read through it. <i>It is not about Bob Dylan.</i> It quotes him at the beginning, it quotes him at the end and suggests an alternative reading of one verse of his. But the main purpose of the article is to establish the feminine nature of the Holy Spirit. I would suggest that you try to add the link to a theological article instead. As to the gospel music part: I am not opposed to that, if other editors than yourself want to add such links; I am not particularly a Bob Dylan expert, although I like much of his stuff. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:16, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've already said that I agree "Gospel" has been a significant part of Dylan's musical world. No argument. I still think the website you're trying to link is not a major Dylan website. I agree with <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a>. It seems to be an argument for an interpretation of the Holy Spirit as feminine, which mentions some Dylan songs. Wikipedia as an encyclopedia is going to be selective. It will not mention every book about Dylan, only the most significant ones. The books "Tangled Up In The Bible" and "Bob Dylan and Philosphy" attempt to engage with a wide part of Dylan's work from a religious &amp; philosophical perspective. They are much broader works than the very narrow website you mention. There are over 100 websites devoted to Dylan's work. Many are about his religious point of view. Some argue for a fundamentalist Jewish interpretation of his work. Some, such as the one you attempt to link, suggest an esoteric Christian interpretation. (I think it does. I don't find the website easy to understand. I'm slightly confused about The Lamb of God and The Red Heifer.) At the end of the day, Wikipedia proceeds by a process of consensus. Some edits stay. Some new stuff goes. You seem to be the only person arguing for one unusually obscure website. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 10:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Stranger still is the further fact that the title of this song is itself intended as a coded name-anagram of Sara Lownds' name:-</p>
<p><b>"SAd eyed lAdy of the LOWlaNDS"</b></p>
<p>(Though the "R" in "Sara" is missing, "LOWLANDS" is clearly a play on words of Sara Lownds' last name, as it was before she married Bob Dylan and became Sara Dylan.)</p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" rel="nofollow">song article</a>, Bob Dylan has never performed this song live. Sara was his inspiration, the love of his life, and his Muse, as is evident from the songs that Dylan wrote for her and with her and which made literary references to her. It is therefore poignant that the woman in the background who means so much to Dylan, and through the music inspired by her, to the world, is inscribed and enshrined in his name.</p>

I do not in fact put much stock in anagrams, and my silly little example was merely meant to show that while "Bob Dylan" could form "B. on B.

I doubt that Dylan chose his name with this anagram in mind, and, not being of a spiritual or mystical turn of mind, I don't think that the fact it can be rearranged that way <b>means</b> anything.

<li>Thank you, apology accepted! On whether this fascinating and remarkable correspondence (which I think it is) was intentional on Bob Dylan's part, while I was not claiming this to be the case, there is strong evidence that he did intentionally interweave his name with that of the person with whom he was enamoured. "Blonde On Blonde" has the acronym <b>"BOB"</b> - <i>his</i> name, while the remainder of "Blonde" is <b>"LO[W]NDe[S]"</b> - <i>her</i> name! The song/poem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" rel="nofollow">"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"</a> could therefore be described as Bob Dylan on Sara Lownds (in the "interpretation of the subject" sense, of course). Either it was the poet or fate that chose all of these correspondences - take your pick - but I find these meaningful anagrams fascinating either way. However, everyone is different, and it appeals more to the poetic mind than it does to the strictly rational mind, which prosaically exclaims: "So what!". But "Wiki" means "for anyone", so we should reasonably allow for both kinds of people or attitudes. I note that Bob Dylan, himself, is someone who belongs to the former category, rather than the latter, and who <i><b>has</b></i> employed the meaningful name-anagram <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Eyed_Lady_of_the_Lowlands" rel="nofollow">(as cited)</a> as a form of literary and poetic expression - I wonder how he would fare if interpreted from an exclusively prosaic and literal perspective? He would be misinterpreted, I think! --Elizabeth Jane 21:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Lowlands" has nothing to do with the name Lownds, just take a look at the geographical locations of New York and Delaware. Look at the picture of his passport in the book that comes with the Bootleg Series Vol 1 - 3. His height is incorrect, his date of birth is incorrect. Is it a genuine passport? No, it's one of the many jokes Dylan likes to play, including acting out his song titles in photographs. "Low - lands". Worked it out yet? BTW, this is a very good article.</p>

<p>Is there actual proof that Dylan is indeed a vegetarian? I've read in some places that he is and I've also read that he just likes to get vegetables a lot but he really isn't a vegetarian.

<p>A Wikipedia editor has added the information that Dylan first learnt his folk style of guitar playing from Marvin Karlins at University of Minnesota. I can find no reference to Marvin Karlins in any of the major Dylan biographies or reference books. I thought it worth adding that Dylan has always credited <a href="../../../o/d/e/Odetta.html" title="Odetta">Odetta</a> with turning him onto folk music, after youthful interest in rock'n'roll, and have left in a short reference to Karlins. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMick_gold_27ac.html" title="User:Mick gold">Mick gold</a> 08:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's valid to include Gospel in Dylan's genres, since he made 2 Gospel album, Slow Train Coming &amp; Saved, as well as many other songs that could be included in the Gospel tradition, eg Every Grain of Sand, Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar. Album of cover versions of Dylan's Gospel compositions by distinguished Gospel singers has been released: Gotta Serve Somebody.</p>

<dd>Dylan's work in the late 1970s and early 1980s was dominated by his becoming, in 1979, a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_again.html" title="Born again">born-again Christian</a>. He released two albums of exclusively religious material, exploring his own version of <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_music.html" title="Gospel music">Gospel</a> music. <i><a href="../../../s/l/o/Slow_Train_Coming_c789.html" title="Slow Train Coming">Slow Train Coming</a></i> (1979), is generally regarded as the more accomplished of these albums, winning him the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a> as "Best Male Vocalist" for his song "Gotta Serve Somebody". The second album, <i><a href="../../../s/a/v/Saved_%28album%29.html" title="Saved (album)">Saved</a></i> (1980), was not so well-received. When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980 Dylan refused to play secular music.</dd>

<dd>Two albums of non-secular music is not substantial or sufficient enough to make Gospel a main genre of Dylan's; the other genres represented (Folk, Rock, Blues, Country) are genres that have been enormously prevalent in his prolific career. If Gospel is mentioned, why not throw in Jazz, Showtunes, Pop, Singer-Songwriter, etc. etc. etc. etc., &amp; anything &amp; everything else he touched base on? He made two albums of non-secular music -- which is in &amp; of itself a stretch to call Gospel music just because it's religious -- that doesn't mean the genre has a place beside the genres that Dylan has helped to reinvent over the years. It should definitely be mentioned in the article, but it's bordering on ridiculous to place it beside the others. ————<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthonylombardi_b146.html" title="User:Anthonylombardi">Anthonylombardi</a> 00:15, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm puzzled. You state (twice) that "Dylan made two albums of secular music." Surely the opposite is true.

It's probably ludicrous to argue about genres and categories when it comes to an artist as inclusive as Dylan.
