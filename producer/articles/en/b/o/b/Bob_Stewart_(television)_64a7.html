<p>Stewart's early broadcasting career included stints first at <a href="../../../w/n/e/WNEW_%28AM%29_09b6.html" title="WNEW (AM)">WNEW-AM</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>, and then at <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s flagship TV and radio stations, WNBC-TV and AM, also in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>. In the book <i>The Box,</i> the native New Yorker said he got the first spark for <i>The Price Is Right</i> during his tenure as a staff producer at WRCA-TV (now <a href="../../../w/n/b/WNBC-TV_f43c.html" title="WNBC-TV">WNBC-TV</a>) when he happened to observe an auction taking place on 50th Street on his lunch hour. He developed the idea into the working title of <i>The Auctioneer.</i></p>
<p>Stewart joined Goodson-Todman Productions in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, after he bumped into broadcaster (and future game show producer-host) <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Hall_d082.html" title="Monty Hall">Monty Hall</a> on the street and Hall told him he knew Goodson-Todman's attorney. "You got any ideas?" Stewart quoted Hall as asking.</p>
<p><i>The Price Is Right,</i> using some of the <i>Auctioneer</i> concept, premiered on NBC <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cullen_a5cc.html" title="Bill Cullen">Bill Cullen</a> as host. <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s <i>To Tell the Truth,</i> emceed by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Collyer_550c.html" title="Bud Collyer">Bud Collyer</a>, hit the air less than one month later, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>. Stewart said he auditioned the concept to Goodson and his producers by trying to have them guess which one of three men had been in the infantry in World War II and was now managing a grocery store.</p>
<p>Five years later, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Stewart scored again with <i>Password,</i> a word-association guessing game emceed by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ludden_e453.html" title="Allen Ludden">Allen Ludden</a>. The show, the first game to pair celebrities and civilian contestants, became the top-rated program on daytime TV and popularized the concept of an end-game bonus round for additional money.</p>
<p>Stewart was one of a coterie of talented Goodson staff producers who came up with ideas for game shows and segments. Producers such as Stewart, Frank Wayne, and Gil Fates earned Goodson's respect not only for their concepts but for their skill in executing them.</p>

<p>After <i>Price'</i>s cancellation (the current CBS version did not premiere until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>), Stewart set out on his own in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. His first network game show as an independent producer, the memory game <i><a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_Guess_7d5a.html" title="Eye Guess">Eye Guess</a></i>, aired on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> daytime from <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and featured close friend <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cullen_a5cc.html" title="Bill Cullen">Bill Cullen</a>, who emceed <i>Price</i>, as host.</p>
<p>Stewart's next entry, the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> primetime celebrity game show <i>The Face Is Familiar</i> with host <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Whitaker_e075.html" title="Jack Whitaker">Jack Whitaker</a>, ran from <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. Another Stewart celebrity game, <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality.html" title="Personality">Personality</a></i> (hosted by <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Blyden_1933.html" title="Larry Blyden">Larry Blyden</a>), aired on NBC from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. Completing the decade for the packager was the short-lived <i>You're Putting Me On</i>, hosted first by Bill Leyden and later by Blyden, which ran from September to December <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>.</p>
<p>Other than <i>Eye Guess,</i> Stewart's other moderate early success was <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_on_a_Match_%28TV_show%29_d9d4.html" title="Three on a Match (TV show)">Three on a Match</a></i>, hosted by Cullen, which aired on NBC from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>Stewart's biggest success with his own production company, and one of TV's most honored and popular game shows, was <i><a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_%28game_show%29.html" title="Pyramid (game show)">Pyramid</a>,</i> hosted by <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Clark_%28entertainer%29_9e7b.html" title="Dick Clark (entertainer)">Dick Clark</a>, which, like <i>Password</i>, was a word-association game. Its <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> premiere on CBS marked the first time a quiz show mounted a five-figure or higher possible cash payoff since the demise of <i>100 Grand</i> in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p><i>Pyramid'</i>s network run would span 15 years, off and on, with escalating dollar amounts in the title reflecting raises in the payoff amount over the years. It has proven to be one of the most enduring game shows, airing almost continuously between first-run network/<a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">syndicated</a> airings and <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable</a> reruns since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, when the second CBS version began. Its nine Emmy awards for best game show rank it second to the current <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Trebek_48f4.html" title="Alex Trebek">Alex Trebek</a> version of <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a>,</i> which has 11.</p>
<p>The network version of <i>Pyramid</i> (hosted by Clark) ran from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> (moving to ABC for its final six years, after CBS cancelled it during a ratings panic in Spring <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>) and from 1982 to 1988 on CBS (with a three month break in the second run). It was also popular in syndication, running once a week on weeknights in many markets from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> (with Bill Cullen as emcee), daily from January to September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> (the tournament-format $50,000 version, Clark emceed this version), daily from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> (hosted by Clark and running concurrently with the CBS version), and again from January <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> to March <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> (with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Davidson_%28game_show_host%29_4ee5.html" title="John Davidson (game show host)">John Davidson</a>). The latter two sported potential cash payoffs of $100,000, which champion contesants could qualify to play for monthly.</p>
<p>Another version of <i>Pyramid</i>, not packaged by Stewart but by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>, which possesses the rights to most of the shows he created, aired in syndication from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, hosted by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donny_Osmond_7b51.html" title="Donny Osmond">Donny Osmond</a>.</p>
<p><i>Pyramid</i> nearly led to Stewart's one significant foray outside the world of TV games. Occasional panelist <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a>, who appeared on the ABC version from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> onward (alternately amusing and annoying Clark) and emceed a game-show pilot <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Riddlers_6f26.html" title="The Riddlers">The Riddlers</a></i> for Stewart, actually hired him to produce the daytime NBC show Letterman would host in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. However, due to creative disagreements, Stewart left the staff four days before the show's premiere.</p>
<p>Bob Stewart Productions was the last major game show production company to relocate from New York to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, with its first show there in full-time production <i>The Love Experts</i> for syndication. This had occurred by the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, but <i>Pyramid</i> actually continued first-run production in New York until its last taping of episodes there in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. As an odd incident of programming irony, during the first half of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, the company's New York-based <i>Pyramid</i> on ABC was competing in the same 12:00noon (Eastern) time slot against its Los Angeles-based <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_Reaction_%28game_show%29_3295.html" title="Chain Reaction (game show)">Chain Reaction</a></i> on NBC.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, almost all of the Bob Stewart games were originating exclusively from Hollywood. The exception was that the updated versions of <i>Jackpot!</i> and <i>Chain Reaction</i> that were produced for the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Network_9169.html" title="USA Network">USA Network</a> on cable during the mid-1980's were videotaped in the Canadian cities of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, respectively. Stewart, a native New Yorker, had resisted the move because he appreciated the intelligence and energy contestants from the Big Apple brought to <i>Pyramid</i>, as well to his other shows. Luckily for Stewart, the show's energetic format was familiar enough to potential contestants nationwide that it endured through the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and beyond.</p>
<p>Other game shows from Bob Stewart Productions -- mostly employing a word or puzzle format -- included <i><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackpot_%28game_show%29.html" title="Jackpot (game show)">Jackpot</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blankety_Blanks_%28US_game_show%29_7585.html" title="Blankety Blanks (US game show)">Blankety Blanks</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoot_For_The_Stars_2b99.html" title="Shoot For The Stars">Shoot For The Stars</a></i>, <i>Winning Streak</i>, <i><a href="../../../p/a/s/Pass_the_Buck_%28Game_show%29_f210.html" title="Pass the Buck (Game show)">Pass The Buck</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_Reaction_%28game_show%29_3295.html" title="Chain Reaction (game show)">Chain Reaction</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_%28game_show%29.html" title="Go (game show)">Go</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Talk_8fd6.html" title="Double Talk">Double Talk</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Jackpot</i> and <i>Chain Reaction</i> were moderate successes for Stewart in their <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> runs on cable TV, after having relatively brief runs on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>. A revived <i>Chain Reaction</i> series currently airs on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Show_Network_ad7d.html" title="Game Show Network">GSN</a>, hosted by Dylan Lane and produced in New York. Its packager is producer of the American <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_To_Be_A_Millionaire_9746.html" title="Who Wants To Be A Millionaire">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Davies_7734.html" title="Michael Davies">Michael Davies</a>.</p>

<p>In the mid 1980s, Bob Stewart began winding down his career and his son Sande gradually took over operations with all shows after <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> being known as under the Bob Stewart/Sande Stewart Productions banner. Stewart would fully retire in 1992 after the second run of <i>The $100,000 Pyramid</i> was cancelled with Sande taking over full operations. The junior Stewart later produced some game shows on his own, including <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/Your_Number%27s_Up_e243.html" title="Your Number's Up">Your Number's Up</a></i> (which went up against the elder Stewart's <i>Pyramid</i>), <i><a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquizition.html" title="Inquizition">Inquizition</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Showdown_1b77.html" title="Hollywood Showdown">Hollywood Showdown</a></i> (which featured elements of his father's <i>Jackpot</i> series), and <i><a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerball.html" title="Powerball">Powerball</a> Instant Millionaire</i>.</p>
<p>Bob Stewart Productions was sold to <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_148d.html" title="Sony Pictures Entertainment">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, and many of Bob Stewart's creations air frequently on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Show_Network_ad7d.html" title="Game Show Network">GSN</a>. Stewart himself has participated in panels and special events related to quiz shows, including the annual <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Show_Congress_fe88.html" title="Game Show Congress">Game Show Congress</a> gatherings in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</p>
<p>While Bob Stewart has not been an active producer since 1992, he serves as a Creative Consultant in his son's new production company <i>Stewart Television</i> and is listed on the official website as its founder.</p>

<ul>
<li>On one episode of the original <i>Price is Right</i>, a contestant won a grand piano. Along with the piano, the contestant won a bonus prize of a "real live African Elephant", this was meant as a gag as the actual bonus prize was $4,000. When the contestant demanded the elephant, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Goodson_013b.html" title="Mark Goodson">Mark Goodson</a> forced Bob Stewart to make arrangements to give the contestant the elephant.

<li>Up until 2006, Bob Stewart held a record for most Daytime Emmy awards in game show production.
