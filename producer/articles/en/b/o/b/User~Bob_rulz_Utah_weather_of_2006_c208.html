	    <p><b><a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>'s weather in 2006</b> was hot and relatively wet, especially across the south. January's temperatures were well above average with about average precipitation, which was followed by a very stormy, cold period from mid-February through mid-April, with much snow through mid-March. One major storm in mid-March brought snow to nearly all of Utah. However, the pattern dried out and warmed up by the end of April, and several successive heat waves occurred from early May through the end of July. The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsoon.html" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a> season was very active from mid-July through August, with widespread flash flooding occurring throughout southern and central <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>, although precipitation in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah_81c5.html" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City</a> was below average during the summer (although above average in August). The first cold fall storm moved into the state in mid-September, and several storms followed through mid-October. Widespread flooding hit southern and eastern Utah in early October, especially around <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanksville%2C_Utah_10eb.html" title="Hanksville, Utah">Hanksville</a>, and a very cold, Arctic airmass, accompanied by heavy snow, moved into the state in late <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a>. December had a few cold snaps and smaller storms, with one large storm in southwestern Utah around <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedar_City%2C_Utah_6f01.html" title="Cedar City, Utah">Cedar City</a>. Due to the generous snowpacks of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> winter seasons, drought was nearly non-existant across the state, creeping only into the far eastern border region and around the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Corners_b5fe.html" title="Four Corners">Four Corners</a> from May through October.</p>
<p>At least 9 weather-related deaths were reported throughout the state in 2006. One person was killed when his private plane crashed near <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanelle_Reservoir_2a81.html" title="Jordanelle Reservoir">Jordanelle Reservoir</a> in heavy snow in early January. Two people were killed by car accidents caused by heavy snow, one each in February and March, while two people were killed by <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalanche.html" title="Avalanche">avalanches</a>, one each in March and April. One person was killed in May when a powerful hail storm south of <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tooele%2C_Utah_a75c.html" title="Tooele, Utah">Tooele</a> caused their car to veer into oncoming traffic. Two children were killed north of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price%2C_Utah_2bad.html" title="Price, Utah">Price</a> in July when the car they were in was swept off the road by a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_flood.html" title="Flash flood">flash flood</a>.
