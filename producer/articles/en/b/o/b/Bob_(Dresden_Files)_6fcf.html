<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_%28Dresden_Files%29_6fcf.html" title="Edit section: Fictional Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fictional Biography</span></h2>
<p>Bob's original name is Hrothbert of Bainbridge. A powerful sorceror, he lived hundreds of years ago, apparently in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. At some point he authored a grimoire, a book of spells that contained, in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Dresden_%28TV_character%29_48b9.html" title="Harry Dresden (TV character)">Harry Dresden's</a> words, "some pretty nasty stuff," including something called a "Doom Box" (episode 101, "Birds of a Feather"). Hrothbert fell in love with a woman, another skilled wizard, by the name of Winifred. However, she was tragically killed, and Hrothbert used black, black magic to resurrect her several times. For this crime, he was condemned, presumably by the High Council, to be a ghost, tied to his skull for all eternity, unable to interact with the world in any physical way. According to the Morningway-doppleganger, the story of Hrothbert and Winifred is legendary in some countries, and Bob is still sensitive about the subject (episodes 106, "Soul Beneficiary;" 110, "What About Bob?").</p>
<p>Eventually, his skull came into the possession of Justin Morningway, a member of the High Council, the wizards' ruling body. Also in Justin's keeping was a copy of Bob's grimoire (which Harry later burned), and, tantalizingly, the secret to ending Bob's sentence. When a young Harry came to live with Morningway, Bob served as the boy's tutor in all things magical, teaching him the principles of black magic, though the practice of same is strictly forbidden by the Council. It is unknown how much Bob was complicit in Justin's actions (murdering Harry's father using a voodoo doll, for instance), but the ghost makes no attempt to stop Dresden or warn Justin when the younger wizard kills his uncle. In a twisted sort of way, all three are responsible for Morningway's death. Justin attempts to murder Harry by throwing a large shard of wood at him, but Bob calls out a warning. Harry dodges, but in doing so falls on the voodoo doll, inadvertantly crushing Justin's heart. Bob's skull is inherited by Dresden along with the rest of the Morningway estate, but Bob apparently is the only inheritance from his uncle that he will acknowledge. Morgan, a Warden of the High Council, is opposed to Dresden's continued possession of the skull, believing that Bob is dangerous (episode 110, "What About Bob?").</p>
<p>Harry has since made a way for himself in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, straddling the world of the everyday and the supernatural by acting as a private investigator and consultant for the Chicago Police Department on seemingly unexplainable cases, and Bob is his secret weapon in this. Not only does Bob contain a wealth of knowledge gleaned from his own wizardly expertise, the ghost has had centuries of experience since being tied to his skull. In addition, Bob can take on the appearance of other people, an ability that has proven essential to the happy resolution of several cases (episodes 103, "Hair of the Dog;" 104, "Rules of Engagement"). The ghostly wizard can also write in the air in glowing letters (episodes 101, "Birds of a Feather;" 106, "Soul Beneficiary").</p>
<p>But to Harry, Bob is far more than a simple tool or resource. Bob is a friend, and both care deeply for each other. The ghost strongly affirms that he would never betray Harry, even though the opportunity has been presented more than once (episodes 101, "Birds of a Feather;" 106, "Soul Beneficiary;" 110, "What About Bob?"). When Bob's mortality is restored by a doppleganger of Justin Morningway, in order to resurrect the original Justin using Bob's infamous black magic spell, Bob instead sacrifices this physical existence so as to destroy Morningway forever. As Bob is dying from the spell, Harry mourns him. Bob, however, knows all along that he would simply revert back to his ghostly existence, and neglects to tell Harry this, so as to hear all the nice things Harry says about him (episode 110, "What About Bob?"). When Dresden is kidnapped by a pair of women planning on using him to commit insurance fraud, Bob faces a difficulty of how to effect any sort of rescue, seeing as he cannot travel far from his skull and cannot, due to his non-corporeal state, say, pick up the phone and call the cops. Fortunately, Detectives Murphy and Kirmani end up coming to Harry's office, and Bob leaves a floating message in glowing letters for them, giving them the information they need to find the missing wizard (episode 106, "Soul Beneficiary"). While Bob may roll his eyes at Harry's "quixotic" desire to help people, he consistently assists Dresden, even if only by offering testy or critical advice.</p>
<p>Bob, though he tries not to let it on too much to Harry, emotionally suffers from his inability to physically affect the world, and he feels responsible when he is unable to stop a woman from getting murderously struck by a car just outside Harry's office. The feeling experienced by a living person when Bob inhabits the same space is quite unsettling. "That's something, at least," Bob mutters glumly (episode 107, "Walls"). He spends his spare time doing such things as redesigning old spells, such as the "Doom Box," something of a magical bomb, which Harry uses to destroy a skin walker (apparently sent by the Morningway-doppleganger) (episode 101, "Birds of a Feather"). Bob is also apparently something of a romantic: he is seen with a handkerchief, wiping his eyes during a movie while a rather bored-looking Harry is watching with his latest girlfriend (episode 105, "Bad Blood").</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_%28Dresden_Files%29_6fcf.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bob does not appear in episode 108, "Storm Front," because at the time of filming <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrence_Mann_025b.html" title="Terrence Mann">Terrence Mann</a> had not yet been hired. "Storm Front," originally intended to be a two-hour pilot for the series, was filmed first, though it aired eighth.</li>
<li>There are many divergences from the original character in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dresden_Files_9bc6.html" title="The Dresden Files">Jim Butcher novels</a> on which the television series is based. For instance, in the books Bob is an elemental spirit of air and intellect, rather than the ghost of a human wizard, and cannot manifest himself beyond a disembodied voice.</li>
<li>Bob's sentence is perpetual. This is displayed particularly in episode 110, "What About Bob?", when Bob's mortality is restored. When Bob dies, he merely returns to his previous ghostly status.</li>
<li>Apparently, Bob can manifest himself whenever he feels like it, even when Harry is not present (episodes 107, "Walls;" 109, "The Other Dick"), but will return to his skull at Harry's command.</li>
<li>Bob cannot range far from his skull (episode 103, "Hair of the Dog").</li>
<li><i>Hrothbert</i>, Bob's original name, is Old English for Robert.</li>
<li>Bob once threatens Harry by saying he will start singing Sixteenth Century show tunes. Since Harry takes the threat seriously, Bob apparently actually knows them. This is evidently a nod to actor <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrence_Mann_025b.html" title="Terrence Mann">Terrence Mann</a>, well-known for his extensive work on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>.</li>
