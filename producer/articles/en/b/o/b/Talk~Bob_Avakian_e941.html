<p>I'm NOT out to redbait here... but I don't think you can really say "he was sighted" doing something in a dictionary entry. Who said they saw him doing this?</p>
<p>Also sketchy is "as a result of the demonstrations" he was charged with a 241 year sentence. What were the charges actually for? etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>Someone added: "Returned to the United States in 2001 and lives in Oklahoma." I've never heard this; I don't know how he could've come back without risk of prosecution.

<p>I added a badly worded sentence on the RCP being an alleged cult of personality around Avakian (which of course it is), but I wasn't signed in.

<p>Somebody tried to turn this article into Anti-RCP agit-prop. I've done my best to reverse that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Adding a one sentence criticism is not turning an article into anti-rcp agit-prop. In fact, one sentence is not enough criticism for Avakian (I actually added more to it after you deleted my last criticism). Just because you are an RCP follower does not give you the right to take out any and all criticism of the group, in fact it's tactics like that that make people (like me) think the RCP is just a cult. The fact is, many people on the left view the RCP as a cult of personality centered around Avakian, and there is even a link to an essay that expresses this idea. This is more than worthy of mention, and not mentioning it is dishonest. If you want to take it out again, don't do so without discussion, otherwise I will consider it vandalism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 22:49, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree, there needs to be a few sentences on the issue of criticism of Bob, especially coming from leftists. Personally I think the whole personality cult thing is kind of goofy. But seriously, there are concerns from leftists and I think they should be adressed.</dd>

<dd>No doubt a range of information needs to be included, but criticisms should be TRUE, not just anonymously cited. Also, there is a long history of distortion passing itself off as opinion passing itself off as "well, everybody knows..." This can be dealt with by CITING particular sources and remembering that this entry is about a living, breathing person and NOT what various (liberal, right-wing, apparently anarchist) critics THINK of him as a person or leader. Criticism should have a separate heading at the bottom where critical entries can be linked externally provided they are factually correct and not just hatchet-jobs.
<dl>
<dd>Criticisms don't need to be true, they just need to be notable, and these are notable criticisms. Saying "X believes Y" is fine, even if Y is incorrect, as long as Y is citable and notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 22:05, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Setting a high standard... but fair enough. Caveat: factually incorrect statements are not criticism, but factually incorrect. You are welcome to think whatever you like in terms of POV, eg "cult." Your opinion need have no basis in fact, which is what makes it opinion. However, there is something peculiarly authoriatian in the attempt to impose one's opinion as the reality of other living people. So, now that "The ungovernable force" has plainly stated his/her agenda, I hope they are prepared for other people who might have some experience in these matters and disagree, quite sharply and might also have been around long enough to know that the opinions of those who openly admit their lack of interest in the truth often tend to miss the mark. What "many people think" is a way of saying "what me and my friends think... oh and the other people who agree with us." Many people think the world was created in seven days, but I'm a little more interested in the geological record...
<dl>
<dd>Any opinion anyone has is true to them. I'm sure many of the things you consider correct (and perhaps even ones we both consider correct) would be considered incorrect by many (such as our belief that Bush purposefully lied to launch an imperialist war, or that religious fundamentalism is fascistic in nature). Does that mean we're wrong? Not necessarily. Does it mean their wrong? In my opinion, yes, but that's just my opinion. That's the funny thing about the "Truth"--there is no such thing as objective truth. It's all relative. And your (seeming) support for Avakian is just as likely to be based on "what me and my friends think" as my lack of support for him. Also, I never said I wanted to impose my view of reality on everyone, I'm merely stating that this is an encyclopedia, and if there is notable criticism it should be mentioned along with citation so that people know about it. They can make up their own minds. Authoritarian would be saying "the RCP is definitely a cult and anyone who doesn't agree is wrong". I'm merely saying that many people on the left have made the accusation, whether it's true or not has no importance. And btw, people in cults rarely realize they are in cults, but my own interaction with the RCP (and other authoritarian left groups) suggest some serious cultish behaviors. So I do believe saying RCP is a cult is true, I'm just merely saying we don't have to prove it objectively (which in my opinion is impossible for anything) to include it, just a notable source. If everything on wikipedia had to be proven true, we would have a pretty small encyclopedia since we can never get everyone to agree on what is and isn't true. Philosophically it raises interesting questions which I don't claim to have the answer for. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:36, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between an "opinion" and a "theory," or a "fact" is not complicated. Some can't see the difference, and therein lies the problem. Bob Avakian exists. That is not an opinion, and if someone says he doesn't exist they are, in fact, wrong. By extension... because someone makes an accusation that doesn't make it noteworthy or true. In a country where laws exist on the books barring communists from immigrating or even visiting the USA, it would seem to me that being extra-careful is in order. Rumors, smack talk and sectarianism are rife in some sections of "the left," particularly among those who think "opinion" is the same as "fact." So, ungovernable force, no one is trying to govern you and you should return the favor. You are welcome to think whatever you want. But don't expect smack talk opinions that can have implications on the real life of real people to just be hosted on an open site. If you'd like to run your opinions, there are plenty of websites and bulletin boards dedicated to that. Wiki is an encyclopedia -- not your comment board.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Criticisms should be linked in a separate section, not laced through the entire entry by the ideologically-motivated. Fact based, well sourced.
<dl>
<dd>There are only two sentences of criticism at the end, how is that "laced through the entire entry"? You are the one who seems to be most ideologically-motivated, refusing to allow sourced and notable criticisms of your beloved <strike>fuhrer</strike> chairman. If you want me to source it better I can, but don't say I can't put them in. Plenty of pages on wiki have mere opinions in them when those opinions are fairly common and are presented as opinions held by some, not as facts. Nowhere does it say the RCP <i>is</i> a cult, just that it has been accused. This is perfectly encyclopedic. Maybe we should go gut any criticisms of Bush, since they are merely opinions and not necessarily facts. Perhaps the current way of saying it should be revised somewhat to say which specific groups make the criticisms, but we can't just take them out. The page on the RCP has an extensive criticism section. I can just add all the sources from their if I have to. Oh, and for all I know, Bob Avakian is merely a figment of my imagination and may not actually exist. So his existence can be claimed to merely be an opinion. Of course, a line has to be drawn somewhere so we can operate effectively, but epistemology is a very interesting topic and I refuse to accept anything as absolute fact. Honestly though, this isn't a philosophy debate, but still...</dd>

<dd>As to your being upset of my affecting the "real lives of real people", I am well aware of state repression, I've had groups I'm involved in spied on by the FBI. Don't talk to me about state repression, I know all about it, and I'm sure Avakian would do nothing but <i>increase</i> it if he were to ever gain power. Do you think Maoist China was some bastian of free-thought? It was a police state that ruthelessly silenced dissenters, including plenty of socialists, communists, anarchists and other leftists who didn't accept the party line. Anyways, using state repression as an excuse to never criticize our "allies" (and frankly, I think the RCP would actually be <i>worse</i> than the republicans if they ever gained power) is a cop-out to avoid critical examination of the shortcomings of the RCP. Anyways these things are already talked about online and in real-life, why not talk about it here? And btw, there are a number of communists here in the US, I have a friend who is a commie who was able to immigrate here. People (usually) aren't thrown in jail for it. And how does criticizing them increase the risk of jail time, the article is pretty clear in saying he's a communist, as is he, so how is this criticism in any way a threat to his or anyone's safety? If he's thrown in jail it will be for being a communist, not because some anarchists didn't like him (since we'd probably be sent to jail first). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 22:24, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone who has actually read Avakian's autobiography (From Ike to Mao and Beyond) needs to go back over this entry for not meeting decent article standards. It explains why Avakian and the RCP chose to send him to Paris, as well as numerous other facts that aren't mentioned or contradicted by this article.</p>
<p>Someone should also find some actual criticisms of Avakian's line and put them up here, not just writing "some people disagree with him about the nature of socialist ussr and china" -- well who, and what do they disagree about specifically? This really needs to be cleaned up if anyone has the time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This entry is composed primarily by those wishing to score political points through "re-writing" his history, which is why there are no citations. It is not currently reliable and I will begin fixing some of the main issues (exile, basic and distinct political contributions, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>From what I can see, the open-editorial function makes these entries something of a free-for-all with truth/falsehood often trumped by persistence and motivation -- from whatever source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article does not even make clear whether Avakian is a fugitive wanted in the USA or if his "exile" was part of a goverment deal. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 11:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is rank speculation and has no basis in fact. None. Avakian is not currently a fugitive. There was no "deal" of any kind.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Linking to any slander piece on the internet, including those which openly admit they are spreading rumors (see: Greg Jackson piece), is simply hackery and not an attempt to understand or enlighten. That ideologically motivated partisans, both pro- and con- are revising here makes this more difficult. I think in the interest of general collegiality and respect for veracity, links and commentary that are clearly POV should be disregarded. I would also like to note that "Ungovernable Force" holds different positions about proper Wiki behavior depending on his/her personal feelings about the topic. This same "editor" has also moved to remove any critism section whatever on a page relating to "Crimethinc". With this in mind, I think adjustments of this page should be noted.</p>
