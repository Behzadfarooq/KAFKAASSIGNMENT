<p>Several baseball reference books give Thurman's date of birth as 1921. However, like so many Negro Leaguers, Thurman took some years off his age in order to interest scouts in developing him as a prospect. In fact, 1917 is the correct year of his birth, as he himself admitted after his playing career was over. Therefore he made his major league debut at the age of 38, and was still in the big leagues at 42.</p>
<p>A left-hander, he was listed at 6' 1" (185 cm) and 205 pounds (93 kg).</p>
<p>Thurman played semipro ball with various teams in the Wichita area before entering the U.S. Army at the beginning of World War II. He was stationed in New Guinea and Luzon and saw combat action in the Pacific Theater. When he was discharged in 1945 the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead_Grays_1f53.html" title="Homestead Grays">Homestead Grays</a> in the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_National_League_39e4.html" title="Negro National League">Negro National League</a> offered him a contract.</p>

<p>He started with the Grays in 1946, playing alongside such greats as catcher <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Gibson_1443.html" title="Josh Gibson">Josh Gibson</a>, first baseman <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Leonard_dfd6.html" title="Buck Leonard">Buck Leonard</a> and outfielder <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_Papa_Bell_6428.html" title="Cool Papa Bell">Cool Papa Bell</a>. His pitching was not impressive, but he played in the outfield as well. He hit .408 for the season. The following year he hit .338 with 6 home runs in 157 at-bats.</p>
<p>In 1948 he posted a 6-4 win-loss record as a starting pitcher, and also hit .345 to help the Grays win the last Negro National League pennant. They went on to defeat the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Black_Barons_b865.html" title="Birmingham Black Barons">Birmingham Black Barons</a> in the World Series, but after this season the powerhouse Grays were dismantled, along with the league. With the fall of the color barrier in the major leagues in 1947, Negro Leagues teams began to lose their star players and also their fan support.</p>
<p>Thurman also played winter ball in Puerto Rico, with the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santurce_Crabbers_68fc.html" title="Santurce Crabbers">Cangrejeros de Santurce</a>, where he was a great fan favorite. He led the league in homers in the 1947-48 season with 9, and the following season he had 18.</p>
<p>In 1949 he reported to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Monarchs_fe34.html" title="Kansas City Monarchs">Kansas City Monarchs</a> of the newly reorganized <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_American_League_41c6.html" title="Negro American League">Negro American League</a>. The Monarchs were managed by <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_O%27Neil_bc72.html" title="Buck O'Neil">Buck O'Neil</a> and their roster included stars and future stars like <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willard_Brown_ed7e.html" title="Willard Brown">Willard Brown</a>, Booker McDaniels, Nat Peeples and <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elston_Howard_80d0.html" title="Elston Howard">Elston Howard</a>.</p>

<p>Thurman's big year in Puerto Rico had not gone unnoticed in the major leagues. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> it was announced that the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> had purchased his contract from the Monarchs. He was assigned to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Bears_f407.html" title="Newark Bears">Newark Bears</a> of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_League_5797.html" title="International League">International League</a>, where he hit three homers in his first week. For the season, he hit .317 for the Bears in 59 games, before a hand injury sidelined him.</p>
<p>The Yankees transferred him to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> and he spent the 1950 season with Springfield in the International League. There his batting average fell to .269. The next two years he was with the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Seals_77f3.html" title="San Francisco Seals">San Francisco Seals</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>, where he hit .274 and .280.

<p>Thurman had continued playing with Santurce in the Puerto Rican league. He was one of the biggest names in Latin American baseball. The Dominican Summer League was founded in the early 1950s. It was an "outlaw" league (not affiliated with major league baseball), and tried to lure big-name minor leaguers with generous salary offers. Thurman signed with Escogido in the new league and was suspended from organized baseball. He played in the Dominican Republic for two years, leading the league in homers and RBI in 1954 and also pitching occasionally.</p>

<p>When the Dominican League joined organized baseball in 1955, Thurman was in limbo. He was still under contract to the Cubs, but they showed no interest. He was still playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, and his 1954-55 season got him noticed again. He hit .323 with 14 homers for a team that <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Zimmer_7c44.html" title="Don Zimmer">Don Zimmer</a> called "the best winter league baseball club ever assembled."</p>
<p>Zimmer played shortstop and Thurman was in right field. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mays_bc08.html" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a> played center field and led the league in batting. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Clemente_e61c.html" title="Roberto Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a> hit .344 for fourth place in the league. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Crowe_64a1.html" title="George Crowe">George Crowe</a> played first base, and former Negro Leagues star Bus Clarkson was at third. <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rub%C3%A9n_G%C3%B3mez_%28baseball_player%29_f145.html" title="Rubén Gómez (baseball player)">Rubén Gómez</a> led the pitching staff.

<p>Impressed with his winter season, the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> bought his contract from the Cubs, for a reported $2,000. He made his major league debut on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">April 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, the same day Elston Howard became the first black man to play for the New York Yankees. Thurman hit 7 homers in only 152 at-bats, although his average fell to .217. The following year he hit .295 in only 139 chances, with 8 homers. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he hit three consecutive homers and a double against the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_Braves_93eb.html" title="Milwaukee Braves">Milwaukee Braves</a>.</p>
<p>The next season he hit a home run against the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> on his birthday, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>. He thus became the first major league player to homer on his fortieth birthday, although that fact was known at the time only to Thurman himself, since he had not yet revealed his true age.</p>
<p>The 1957 season was Thurman's best in the major leagues. He started the year on a hot streak. On June 1 he was hitting .351, but by the end of June his average had dropped to .259. On August 2 he was sent down to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Rainiers_2eb0.html" title="Seattle Rainiers">Seattle Rainiers</a> of the Pacific Coast League. He hit 8 home runs in the Pacific Coast League before being recalled by the Reds later in August. The Reds were in a slump, and Thurman helped get them out of it. In his first five games back with the team, he hit 4 home runs with 12 RBI.</p>

<p>Thurman played the entire 1958 season with the Reds and had a few pinch-hitting appearances with them in 1959. His final game was <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>.

In 1960 he hit .274 with Charleston, also of the American Association. He was now 43 years old.

<p>Thurman had a career .246 average in 334 major league games. He hit 35 homers and drove in 106 runs in 663 at-bats. He played 12 seasons in the Puerto Rican winter league. He is the league's all-time home run hitter, and a member of the Puerto Rican Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>He joined the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> as a scout after his playing career ended, and later scouted for the Reds and the Royals. He died in Wichita in 1998, aged 81.</p>
