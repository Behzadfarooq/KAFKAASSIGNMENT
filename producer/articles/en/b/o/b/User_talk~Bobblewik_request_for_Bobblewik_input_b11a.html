<dd>Many thanks for the tip. Take a look at the edits that I made. I don't worry too much about &amp;nbsp myself, but I know that others welcome it. I generally use the symbolic form when in parentheses thus <i>(20 ft)</i> rather than <i>(20 feet)</i>. I also use the symbolic form in tables. I hope that suits you. Feel free to modify anything that I have done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as converters is concerned, I do appreciate it when people point them out to me. So far I can manage with the Google converter (just do a google search for '20 feet' and see what it does) if Google can't do it immediately, I look for official references and do simple multiplication on Google. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 20:00, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you have access to a Unix/Linux machine, you may want to try <i>units</i>. It can convert some 2000 units. It directly converts, for instance, "furlongs per fortnight" into m/s, "2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds" into seconds, or "2 ft 3 ft 12 ft" into stere (from the manual). <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 20:12, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hello bobble, this is sg_han and i need your help...somehow qatar airways's website got vandalised. just look at the "destinations" part turning into "services" can the old one which is the more informative one be reverted and can you tell me who the culprit is by looking at the history?thanks looking forward to your reply soon<a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.156.2.170.html" title="User:202.156.2.170">202.156.2.170</a> 12:36, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can do this yourself. Here is how. Click on the 'history' tab. That will show you the list of edits. If you want to see what happened in an edit, just click on 'last' (at the left).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By doing that, I see that 'destinations' was changed to 'services' by User:217.43.187.37.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to revert an article, here is how. Click on 'history' tab as before. Click on the date of the version you want. Click on the edit tab. Select all the text and copy it. Then go back the current version of the article by clicking on 'article' and then 'edit'. Then paste the old text over the current text. That is how you do it but I don't advise that you do it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope that helps. This really is not my field and I am not sure where to suggest. Try asking in the talk page of the article (click on the 'discussion' tab or ask at: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28assistance%29_e548.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)">Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 12:54, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Probably an old question for you...is there a link to a converter for units of area...ie: acres to hectacres? I see you use google converter but I can't seem to find it...thanks for helping out.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:12, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Google converter is part of the normal Google search. Just do a normal Google 'search' for '2 acres' and see what happens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It normally converts from non-SI to SI. So acres will be converted to square metres. So '2 acres' gets converted to '8 093.71284 m²' which I would round to '(8,000 m²)' for the article. Similarly, '2000 acres' gets converted '8 093 712.84 m²' which I would round to '(8 km²)' for the article. One square kilometre is 1 km by 1 km i.e. 1000 m by 1000 m. Therefore 1 km² is 1,000,000 m².</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It will convert to other units. For example search for '2000 acres in sq km'. This is useful if you are not familiar with the jumps in unit sizes. You can also use this method to get hectares if you must. You can use this method to back convert from metric e.g. '2 sq km in acres'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My priority is to use SI units i.e. square metres for small areas and square kilometres for large areas. The hectare is not SI. In addition, apart from farmers, most metric readers understand metres and kilometres better than hectares. However, I know that some people want to use hectares. If you are inclined to use hectares, remember that 100 hectares = 1 square kilometre. So once you get above 100 hectares, please consider putting the value in square kilometres. I hope that helps. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_12cf.html" title="User talk:Bobblewik">(talk)</a> 12:37, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the Google converter also lets you specify the units in the result; just use "in" followed by the units. For example, search for "2 acres in hectares" or "5.7 hectares in square feet" or "37.2 acres in square feet". <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 12:59, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks again for further clarification. I am a bit of a math moron and am a complete alien to the metric system so do not hesitate to correct my work if it looks incorrect. I agree that I want this to be understood internationally because I realize aside from the archaic American use of standard measurements, the vast bulk of humanity has joined the 21st century!

<p>I don't know what to do with this: Decreto Número 99.226, de 27 de Abril de 1990.</p>
<p>It needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new title (in English)</li>
<li>translation of the Portuguese part</li>
<li>categories</li>
<li>cleanup</li>
<li>cleanup-context</li>
<li>wikification</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm tempted to nominate it for deletion. The subject <i>per se</i> is probably worth saving but the page is almost hopeless. Any thoughts? ♠ <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 05:26, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like just a statement of source material. I agree that it should either be deleted as you say, or transferred to Wikisource as suggested on the talk page. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 13:38, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bobblewik, Boy do I owe you big time! LOL Not sure how to repay you, LOL Again, Thank-you much and welcome back! <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottfisher_7c5b.html" title="User:Scottfisher">Scott</a> 18:43:17, 2005-09-11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My pleasure. No need to repay me, repay somebody else. I have already been repaid by the previous kindness of others. In any case, your increasing inclination to use metric units is rewarding for me.</dd>

<dd>Google is your friend. Look at how easy it is to convert: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=2600+miles&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=2600+miles&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">2600 miles</a> and any other measure such as <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=20+knots+in+km%2Fh&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=20+knots+in+km%2Fh&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">20 knots in km/h</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 18:52, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are way too much! You are much more user friendly, LOL Everthing comes up 2600 miles! Google makes me afraid for metrics now, Thank-You, I think I better stick with your knowledge, just feel plain guilty about asking you as I know its your time......

<dd>If you look at the google example, you will see that it is just a 'search' for '2600 miles'. It produces the answer <b>4 184.2944 kilometers</b> in bold at the top. I just put 2600 miles in the search field. That is all a google conversion is.</dd>

<dd>Do not feel guilty about asking me. I always have the option to say no if I don't want to do it. Ask as much as you want. With google converter, it is easy. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 19:08, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
