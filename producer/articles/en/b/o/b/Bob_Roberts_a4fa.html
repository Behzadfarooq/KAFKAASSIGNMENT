It is a satirical <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mockumentary.html" title="Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> on the rise of a <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">right-wing</a> candidate for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>. The main character, Bob Roberts, played by Robbins, leaves his <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> parents to enroll in a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_academy.html" title="Military academy">military academy</a>. Bob is well financed, due mostly to his dubious business dealings in the past and is well known from his <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, which proposes a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> vision in a rebel's persona, which was described early on in the film by a local TV presenter as “deviant brilliance; a work of machiavellian art”. The film centers around his bid for the position of Senator from <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The film portrays the U.S. political process in a less-than-favorable light, suggesting that shady deals, hypocrisy and deceit are mainstays of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>Bob Roberts is based on a short segment of the same name and character that Robbins did for the television sketch comedy program <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, and is the first film in which Robbins takes on the role of director.</p>

</div>
<p><i><b>Bob Roberts</b></i> takes place in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> during the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>, chronicling the senatorial race between <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> folk singer, Bob Roberts (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Robbins_5ba1.html" title="Tim Robbins">Tim Robbins</a>) and the incumbent, Brickley Paiste (<a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore_Vidal_7281.html" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>). The film is shot through the perspective of a British documentary filmmaker who is following the campaign of Roberts, and through his lens we see the main character travel across the state performing songs about evil drug users, lazy poor people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal breaks involving him and a young woman who he was seen emerging from a car with. It turns out that she was a friend of his granddaughter who was being driven home by Paiste, but he cannot shake off the accusations.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign the reporter Bugs Raplin (<a href="../../../g/i/a/Giancarlo_Esposito_ad3a.html" title="Giancarlo Esposito">Giancarlo Esposito</a>) attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the people as a fraud, due to connections between his anti-drug charity and <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> drug trafficking. As the election approaches Roberts is asked to appear on a network’s sketch comedy show (that is clearly representative of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a>), which causes a dispute among the cast and producers of the show, since Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song that he had originally intended, but instead performing a new piece. When this new song turns out to be nothing more than a blatant campaign endorsement, an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, someone attempts to assassinate him, thus overshadowing the evening’s recent, image-crushing events. The reporter Bugs Raplin is initially linked to the shooting, but is later cleared when it is found that due to his cerebral palsy in his right hand he couldn’t possibly have fired the gun. Bugs contests that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground, not at Bob. Boosted by the outpour of support following the assassination attempt, Bob ends up winning the election with 52% of the vote. Later, at a victory party, although the wounds supposedly crippled the lower half of Bob's body but he is seen tapping his feet to the rhythm of one of his songs. However, the press covering his performance do not observe this, and it is left unexposed. Bugs is killed, presumably by one of Roberts' supporters, thus creating joyous mayhem among fans gathered outside Roberts' apartment. When the film ends the viewer is left with many questions about just how deep the conspiracies of Roberts go.</p>
<p>Artisan's special-edition DVD has many features, with a transfer in the original full-frame (1.33:1) and Dolby 2.0 Surround. Three commentary tracks are included: one with Robbins, another with Robbins and Vidal together, and a third track with <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpunch.html" title="Counterpunch">Counterpunch</a> editors <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Cockburn_c72d.html" title="Alexander Cockburn">Alexander Cockburn</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_St._Clair_0390.html" title="Jeffrey St. Clair">Jeffrey St. Clair</a>, which has nothing to do with the movie but rather is a detailed discussion of CIA-related drug conspiracies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Roberts_a4fa.html" title="Edit section: Style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Style</span></h2>
<p>The style of <i>Bob Roberts</i> is drawn from a number of real and mock documentaries, and its shots are carefully crafted to create this effect, in many cases through the use of hand-held cameras. Not only does Roberts’ character draw from 60’s era iconography of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, it also takes from the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> documentary, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Dont_Look_Back_3755.html" title="Dont Look Back">Dont Look Back</a></i> (sic), made about the singer, employing a similar (although consciously constructed) <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_verit%C3%A9.html" title="Cinema verité">cinema verité</a> style (Ansen 1992; Canby 1992). The film also draws from the mock-documentary <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_is_Spinal_Tap_4b7a.html" title="This is Spinal Tap">This is Spinal Tap</a></i> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Reiner_ca62.html" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>) which Robbins states to be a favorite film of his (Roberge 1992), and directly references this during the scene in which Roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance. Another technique which Robbins takes from Reiner is the use of improvisation, which he encouraged the cast to use. In the case of <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore_Vidal_7281.html" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>’s character, the majority of the lines were not scripted, and instead Vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs, and his real life positions on many of the fictional election topics (Johnson 1992; Kauffman 1992). Robbins artfully borrows from a wide range of films and historical campaign events. The movie has elements of <i><a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_%28film%29.html" title="Nashville (film)">Nashville</a></i> by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Altman_89d1.html" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a> as well as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Candidate_%281972_film%29_c46d.html" title="The Candidate (1972 film)">The Candidate</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Redford_cfb9.html" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Roberts_a4fa.html" title="Edit section: Response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h2>
<p>While critics and audiences have responded to this film by connecting Roberts’ character to various political figures, such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> and Pennsylvania senator <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a> (due to the similarity in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> values), Robbins’ intentions for the film seem to be less partisan, and more about the political system in general (Roberge 1992). In the film Robbins does not clearly identify either candidate's partisan alliance (although we do see Senator Paiste identified on TV as a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, so we are left to assume that Roberts is almost definitely a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a>, due to that party's more right-wing values), and presents neither Roberts nor Paiste as particularly appealing, both having significant shortcomings in terms of being popular candidates for office. While the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> of the film is assumed by some to be based on Robbins’ own political beliefs, he is not overly supportive of the left, portraying the democratic candidate as rather earnest, but not very in tune with the political system or the best ways to get in touch with the public. It seems that much of Robbins' commentary is addressed at the role of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">election</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaigns.html" title="Campaigns">campaigns</a>, and around the fact that politicians’ success is due in large part to their ability to market themselves in a manner that is appealing to the public (Roberge 1992). In the film this comes across as being based much more around the candidates’ value as entertainers than the value of their words, for Roberts’ image as a 60’s era motorcycle riding, guitar playing rebel sells much better than Paiste’s as a hapless career politician. While some have critiqued Robbins for failing to make an effective political satire, stating that his references to <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a>-era politics and the rebelliousness of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>’s are simply too anachronistic in the context of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a> (Troy 1993; Wattenberg 2001), others have praised it as a triumph for its ability to articulate political commentary as an entertaining <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> piece (Ansen 1992). In the end, it seems that this is meant to be the primary intention of the film.</p>
