<p>I amended this page on Dec 6, 2005 to more accurately communicate the term.</p>
<p>Much of the information in the previous version of the article was inaccurate, misleading and/or irrelevant.</p>
<p>In my opinion, such an article should not exist in the public domain. But since there will be one, it is best the information in it is accurate.</p>

<p>I completely agree that this article should not be here. First of all, there is no published source of information, primary source of information, available. Without a primary source of information (originating source) any information about it is from secondary and tertiary sources. All of that secondary and tertiary information relies on unpublished (often stolen) primary information. Is this really what wikipedia is going to be about? How Individuals and groups commit crimes and post their results here&#160;? And even assuming such secondary source know what they are talking about (HA!) the information is only opinion. In the main secondary sources such as Xenu.net intend to destroy Scientology. It would be foolish to accept thier opinion as "the real deal". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 17:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no primary, published source available. The Church of Scientology publishes no literature about it, yet it is the Church which originates this idea, according to the secondary sources in the article. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="WP:V">WP:V#Verifiability, not truth</a> states: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." A couple of secondary sources make comment but is that enough to create an article on? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a> "Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation." Do those secondary sources of information present real information, trusted information? Their quality of information is not all that good, less good that "unimpeachable" (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). But most importantly We should delete this article because the secondary sources cite themselves sources of information which has been contested by the source information, Scientology. It has brought lawsuits variously against the secondary sources of information that this article talks about. Obviously the Church is not commenting on the validity of this information. Therefore this applies: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_anarchy" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_anarchy</a> "Wikipedia is free and open, but restricts both freedom and openness where they interfere with the purpose of creating an encyclopedia. Accordingly, WIkipedia is not a forum for unregulated free speech." Because Scientology's original information is unpublished, has been involved in lawsuits, etc. it isn't a source for an encyclopedic article. It might be a good article as a newspaper expose' but not an encyclopedic article. Let's remove it, what do you all say? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can tell you it is not central as I can tell you Space Opera is not central to Scientology. But why take my word for it? Why don't you read some professional opinions of what is Central to Scientology? Doctors of Divinity, Well known Clergy, Persons who testify as professionals to governments and even to the United Nations were asked by the Church of Scientology to give their professional opinions about Scientology. <a href="http://www.humanrights-germany.org/experts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humanrights-germany.org/experts/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> None of them say it is central.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:11, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as usual your response attempts to ignore the main question. The question is, "Are there verifiable informations about this subject" and the answer is almost no. The answer is not quite no because an expose' type article could be crafted from the sources of information available. But those sources are not "unimpeachable" sources, instead those sources involve themselves with fringe and not mainstream information. Rather than published in books, copyrighted informations, those sources of information use legally contested, even stolen documents. That is the informational base of this article. That is why I suggest the article be deleted. There are no primary source documents. There are a couple of secondary sources of dubious quality. It doesn't meet the standards of quality <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> calls for. Feldspar says, "terryeo doesn't see it but that is the reason it should be an article.

<dd><i>Feldspar says, "terryeo doesn't see it but that is the reason it should be an article.</i> No, Feldspar says exactly what he said above: anyone arguing that an article should be deleted because it has false information, and furthermore arguing that all that is needed to "prove" the information is false is that it "has been contested", <i>does not comprehend Wikipedia.</i> You cite policies, but you cite them in ways which make it awfully clear that you never read more of them than the title and perhaps the first line or two. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:41, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sheesh, did I not sign my above post earlier? Anyway Feldspar, as usual you replies are abusive, what good does your phrase, "does not comprehend Wikipedia" do you? I am saying there is no primary source information about this subject. I have said it several times. Here, I'll say it again, there is no Primary Source information about this article. The single public document before the public is before the public because the Judge to whom Scientology appealed that it be taken from the public eye, refused because he considered it to be a "fairy tale". lol. And on that basis you and others are creating a fable about it being a real world situation, happened 75 million years ago, oh hum, central to scientology and all the rest of the fallacy.

<dd>"Abusive"? You may not like it being pointed out that you clearly haven't read many of the policies whose titles you are citing, but please explain to me how it was phrased any more abusively than your own "Why is it necessary with you people to point out that simple, straightforeward statemetns like: "Term, Topic, Context" mean 1.

Exactly how do you look at what you said to other editors there about what you <i>thought</i> was <i>their</i> ignorance of policy (though as we've seen, it was your understanding of the guideline that was flawed) and find it less "abusive"? As for the rest of your post, it quite frankly reaches new lows. At this point you well know that Warren McShane, <b>as Scientology's witness</b>, testified in court to the fact that the doctrines of Scientology included "Xemu and the volcanoes and ... the great catastrophe that occurred 75 million years ago".<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/coskit/faegre/injunc/mcshane3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/coskit/faegre/injunc/mcshane3.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Your idea that you <i>can</i> pass it off, at this point, as a "fable" created by others, just beggars belief. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My position is that you have yet to put forth a good case for the article to be deleted. I understand your position that you think you have, but I also understand that your thinking so is based on your <i>not</i> understanding the policies of Wikipedia to the degree that you think you do. For instance, can you <i>now</i>, after it's been explained to you several times, show your understanding of why Fleischmann and Pons' <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> experiments are <b>not</b> "original research"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feldspar, you consistantly don't reply to the points I bring up, consistently side with persons who say they know any scientology datum has been debunked many times and consistently attempt to argue instead of working toward good articles. You have made your position on this matter clear. I have made mine clear. You notice my posts don't say things like, "You don't understand ...." and don't use words like "slime" etc. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 01:35, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your opinion. To correct you on just a few of many points: I very often <i>do</i> reply to the points you bring up, only to see you change the subject or repeat some mistaken notion of yours yet again even though you've already been alerted that it's incorrect.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Clear_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35929381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Clear_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35929381" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I work towards good articles, but much too often I have to interrupt the actual work in order to deal with irrelevancies or sometimes <i>outright falsehoods</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Clear_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=36963199&amp;oldid=36959576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Clear_%28Scientology%29&amp;diff=36963199&amp;oldid=36959576" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> being brought up on the talk page. You have indeed made your position clear but you have also made it clear that your position is based on Wikipedia policies that you don't necessarily understand (for instance, I have to think that if you <i>could have</i> answered my question about Fleischmann and Pons, you <i>would have</i>; to avoid replying to a direct question like that <i>and</i> in the same post complain that <i>I</i> don't reply to the points you make would be rather hypocritical, don't you think?) I notice that your posts have never used the actual specific five-letter word "slime" but I also can point to at least two examples where you knowingly and deliberately told falsehoods about other editors. What makes you think lying about other editors is less objectionable? As for the claim that you "don't say things like 'You don't understand'", I doubt that's even true on the technicality (technically not available to you, since you said "like") of never having actually started a sentence with those three specific words. Why, look, here we go: "Why is it necessary with you people to point out that simple, straightforeward statemetns like: "Term, Topic, Context" mean 1. Term. 2. Topic, 3.

<p>Uhm, didn't CoS validate the sources by suing for copyright infringement? Unless the documents were *copies*, they could have only sued for trademark infringement or disclosure of trade secrets, right? Anyways, we have Touretzky's documents, we have the legal records for the Lerma case, the Spaink case, Spaink's publications, Margery Wakefield's publications, Jon Atack's work, the Fishman Affidavit, the Vorlan pack, etc. We're well over only "one" source at this point, we have multiple sources which corroborate each other... Anyways, I also *do* realize that some editors/researchers may be forbidden by their creeds from reading the above-mentioned materials, but the materials are certainly out there for people to find (and thus, meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not have an exception for specific creeds and their access to sources, which can be a problem. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 07:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Therefore, since RTC claims they're authentic and so do the critics, there is no POV dispute here. Both sides <i>explicitly state</i> that the documents are real: the critics say so in their publications, and RTC say so in their legal filings. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 07:44, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The lawsuit was not fuzzy, it was explicit on what was copyright infringement, what was libel, and what portions were parts of each.

Someone who didn't understand Wikipedia's policies on sources (gee, can we guess who that is?) told you "Any information that the Church doesn't willingly publish to any person in the world is not primary source information and they can't use it. And since a Wikipedia editor inserting his own personal analysis/opinion/judgement of a subject into the article itself is something they call 'original research', you'll clearly be able to use that phrase to attack any reasoning on any subject coming from any editor on any talk page." sorry, wrong on several counts, and you're better off learning it on your own than learning it from someone who doesn't have it right himself. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:08, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh really Feldspar, you can't even define the term and the article certainly doesn't and you are blowing off about adequate hatting? The article doesn't have a definition, maybe 1/1,000,000 of the population has any interest in it and maybe 1/1000 of those people know the meaning of the term. It has no definition. The only definition would be found in certain Church of Scientology, confidential documents. The term is mentioned in the now-public Xenu document with a lot of other fairy tale.

<dd>It could also be the JimmyT sees the logic to the arguement. The only publication that mentions "body thetans" is the Xenu document which is public because the Judge who refused to remove it from the public called it a "fairy tale". This article has one and only source of published information, that document. There is no other source of information. No one even knows what a damn "body thetan" really means. With no primary source (except the fairy tale) and no secondary or tertiary sources the article can be nothing but OR, published from a single document which in turn is published from a single source. And, that source has never commented on it. It could even be argued to be violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> since it cites one and only one point of view. It violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> since only one fairy tale mentions "body thetan".

<p>Take my word for it. This article can not become a NPOV article because the only definition extant on the planet is within confidential (and this means unpublished) documents which are carefully controlled by the Chruch of Scientology. With no primary source of information and with only one document that ever mentions the topic, and with many beanbrain xenu.net and clambake.net secondary sources, this topic can never become NPOV. LOL. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 05:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have access to these sources then please feel free to use them to improve this article! If you don't, then please don't speculate about them. RTC and "critics" have already agreed to the authenticity of the "leaked" sources that inform this article, so there doesn't seem to be a dispute about those, unless possibly from someone prepared to refute RTC's claim to copyright. But more sources are <i>always</i> worthwhile! --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 07:32, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't speculate, Foofoo. I told you. You are free to research your Foo nose off about it but if you do, you'll see what I said makes sense. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:29, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Usage of the POV tag is clearly dictated on WP:DP. And it is impossible for me, or anyone else even if a Scientologist, to offer any primary sources as entreated. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyT_3543.html" title="User:JimmyT">JimmyT</a> 09:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then we have to go from the (again, undisputedly authentic) sources available. The claim that "there are no primary sources" is simply false as described above; the sources are already cited. It's unfortunate that RTC/CoS doesn't wish to discuss the matter openly ... but, absent their substantive comment, we are obliged to go with what we have. If "critics" cite sources and Scientologists don't, and the article represents that fact honestly, then Wikipedia policy has been obeyed. Wanna fix it? <i>Cite your sources.</i> --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 10:10, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you really think so, fix it! The approach needed has already been described. Just remember that neutrality doesn't mean showcasing <i>your</i> opinions (or your group's doctrines) any more than it means showcasing someone else's. The best approach is simply to provide the information that your sources describe, and to cite those sources. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 10:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Foo Foo, let me give you a clue and save you some trouble, okay? The Church of Scientology has a specific policy about how to publically reply to and handle people who take the sort of assertive, "PROVE IT TO ME!" approach you take here. I am not the Church, I am willing to aquaint you with what you will encounter. If you are actually willing to understand their policy and wish to know what it is, I would be willing to spell it out for you. It would save you a good deal of time, effort and trouble if you did understand, but because you don't seem to responsively reply, I won't fill our discussion page with information unless you ask.

<p>Wikipedia policy doesn't make exceptions for Scientology. We go by the same rules here that we go by anywhere else. <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Cite your sources</a> is one of those rules. If you aren't willing to cite sources on this subject, then you aren't contributing usefully here. Chanting "POV" over and over again isn't going to help, folks -- in order to have a substantive disagreement you need to cite sources. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:19, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>L. Ron Hubbard's own son wrote a book about his father's religion. in it, he describes much of these beliefs. Also, After arresting many Scientologists for wire tapping government agencies and tax evasion, writings were confiscated. Some writings confiscated described these very beliefs. There is plenty of evidence to prove that this article is accurate. Evidence taken from the Scientologists themselves. Only a Scientologist would want this article removed, as it brings to light much of the insanity of the church of Scientology.

<p>The article is dumb and should be deleted. There is no primary source of information for the article. The only sources of information for the article are unpublished, seondary sources which when put together create a sort of "maybe body thetan means ....." Which is real poor encyclopedic writing, it verges on newspaper expose' writing. The article is dumb, has no source of information and should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:02, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
