<p>This article is not only written and edited by the host company, it violates a number of fundamental Wikipedia philosophies:</p>

NPOV or Neutreal Point of View [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]</p>
<p>but also</p>
<p>The Five Pillars of the Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, it annoys me too. This company does seem to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> though... so I've just taken a buzzsaw to it and trimmed it down to a basic description. If you'd like to take it to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> though, I'd be there. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:38, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/d/Talk%7EBodog_c474.html" title="Edit section: Correct use of link text">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Correct use of link text</span></h2>
<p>I notice you keep editing link text and removing external reference links, and you do so to "correct link style"</p>
<p>The matter of fact is that Wikipedia explicitly specify to use descriptive link text, and let me quote from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)#Link_titles" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)#Link_titles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)#Link_titles</a></p>
<p>"Generally, URLs are ugly and uninformative; it is better for a meaningful title to be displayed rather than the URL itself. For example, "European Space Agency website" is much more reader-friendly than "<a href="http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.html</a>". There may be exceptions where the url is well known or is the company name. In this case, putting both the url and a valid title will be more informative, for example, "European Space Agency website, www.esa.int"."</p>
<p>Notice how the Manual of Style *does not* encourage the use of "Official site". In this case "Official site" is as undescriptive as it can possibly get. "Bodog Entertainment Group" is, without any doubt descriptive, and the official name of the organization. The official name of the Bodog.com site is "Bodog Sportsbook &amp; Casino &amp; Online Poker™", so an equally descriptive and officially correct link text is "Bodog Sportsbook &amp; Casino &amp; Online Poker™"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Official site is clearly the most descriptive choice, I can't imagine what your argument would be there, but in any case this is how the other sites are linked in the categories that Bodog belongs to. There is no reason that your site should or will be treated differently. You could start a discussion here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Poker" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Poker" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Poker</a> to argue diffently but do not talk about Bodog as that doesn't matter at all. What matters is how all the articles of the same nature are stylistically structured. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:59, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I stricltly follow the guidelined provided by the official Manual of Style, and will continue to do so until you provide me with a page from the official Wikipedia Manual of Style or similar guideline. Thank you, Sverre</p>
<dl>
<dd>I personally would prefer a different style than Offcial site, but until a much larger discussion takes place making one site different is inappropriate. And also, the spam link text is obviously inappropriate. "Bodog" or "Bodog official site" would be the only other choices as those are the companies offcial name. This article is not for a company employee to spam keywords in link text. Please do not do it again. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:40, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I fully understand the problem with spamming, and this certainly is not spamming. The matter of fact is that "Bodog Sportsbook &amp; Casino &amp; Online Poker™" is the official name of the site, and, let be be very clear, until you provide *official documentation* in where it *explicitly* says that gambling sites should not use descriptive anchor text, I must insist that you refrain from further editing.</p>
<p>From my point of view, this is on the border to pure vandalism until you provide me with the rules to back up your point of view.</p>

<p>Fair enough, delete the TM. I'm still very interested in seeing documentation to back up 2005's claims about "special rules" that apply for certain entries.

<dd>I revert the same spam much as ten times a day, so I have no interest in a silly edit war. I started a discussion here <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Poker_1d73.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Poker">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Poker</a> since there is no similar broader Gambling project. Sverre, if you want to start thinking like an editor instead of a company SEO, please contribute to that discussion. If folks agree that keyword stuff links are the best way to go, then that's how articles will be structured. Otherwise, you can "insist" that Bodog be treated differently than everyone else, but it won't happen, and you'll just embarrass your company further. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 23:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a reason why Wikipedia have its link policy the way it is, and it is obviously to follow W3C's guidelines on accessibility (WAI) and proper, good markup. W3C recommends in it's WCAG, and I quote: "Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For example, avoid "click here."", and the Wikipedia even quotes W3C as a reason to use descriptive anchor text. "Official site" is clearly as descriptive "Click here", and should under no circumstances be used no matter what category we are talking about.</dd>

<dd>I think reasonable judgment makes it clear that keyword stuffing link text doesn't improve anyone's experience here. And if it were okay, and no one here showed good judgment, then every company with an external link here would wind up with an 8 or 9 word anchor text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The documentation in the Five pillars says that the most neutral point-of-view should be used; surely this kind of keyword stuffing isn't neutral? Most of the external links I see use the shortest identifiable company name along with the phrase official site. <a href="../../../r/r/a/User%7ERray_9aaf.html" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> 00:39, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(2) Advertising - this is a blatant corporate advertising plug. (3) If you were serious about including this as part of a comprehensive online poker list, if you don't have any sources, the better thing to do would be to stub it and propose text on this talk page, not just copy a corporate statement. (4) The extensive list of equally non-noteworthy people on this page screams out "look at me! I'm on Wikipedia!" (5) I could actually see having some relevance if what'shisname's bust were WP:V and had *any* significance to anything. (6) Who cares what software they run?

<dd>1) Sources about what a company does are fine obviously. Removing the stuff like "a zillion wagered" is fine too, but the company can certainly be the source for "they offer sports betting". 2) Hardly, but irrelevant anyway. The point is the company should have an article. Perhaps this one should be rewritten, even rewritten harshly. There is no justification for blanking it. 3) I don't even know what you think you are refering to here. Again, the statements aren't issue, the blanking it totally is. A simplae article can be written stating obvious facts: they offer sports betting, they offer poker, they have a couple players as sponsored players, they have a music arm. That's about it. You can't possibly have a gripe about that. 4) Fine, take the "non-noteworthy" musicians out then. Once again, that has nothing to do with blanking, also some of the people are noteworthy. 5) huh? 6) Not me. I care that there is an article. Having it describe the software is trivia that could or could not be included. More to the point, who cares that software is described? 7) That's just a strange position to take. They have a noteable business that obviously merits mention, and if you or anyone doesn't think so they could afd, but the company runs a TV show, major online businesses and a record label. Of course they merit an article, certainly more so than at least half of the articles in the wikipedia. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 01:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Note, I didn't blank you, someone else did. I would have stubbed it. My simple (non-legal =) ) advice is not to get so wrappped up in the conclusion "there must be an article about this company" that you lose sight of the greater function of an encyclopedia.

<p>Well honestly, this company has always seemed to me to meet our inclusion guidelines for companies (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) in that it's listed on various rankings of companies in its industry, it's been given meaningful press coverage by good sources <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bodog&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bodog&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and it seems to have a meaningful presence in its industry. And though the pre-blanking version may not have been great, there's no requirement that it be perfect before we have an article (far from it, the concept that articles improve gradually over time is fundamental to the project). This should be decided at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, technically. I'd like to see the article either be reverted or taken to AfD, personally.

<dd>The two External links plus categories###</dd>
<dd>I'd put this up in place of what was there. If a wikipedia employee wants to then blank it because Bodog employees are acting irresponsibly about the encyclopedia in ways the rest of us don't know about, fine, but an article something like the above clearly should be in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 02:26, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm fine with the compromise, 2005. I agree with W.marsh that the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guideline is met.

<p>I'm no more fond of advertising and long lists of links than anyone else but surely the company's official website in the external links section isn't excessive? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantthinkofagoodname_1ff5.html" title="User talk:Cantthinkofagoodname">talk</a>) 00:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the Popular Culture section, it had several flaws: It read like an advertisement for the video game, rather than a reference. Also, the game was just released in 2006 and is hardly popular enough to be considered for a "pop culture" reference. Who really cares where BoDog's logo pops up? <a href="../../../w/t/b/User%7EWtbe7560_923c.html" title="User:Wtbe7560">Wtbe7560</a> 18:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
