<p>Hi there, Bodnotbod. I too, have begun to specialise in Wiki pages dedicated to British comedy. Maybe you'd like to give my <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Munnery_03bd.html" title="Simon Munnery">Simon Munnery</a> page the once over to make sure that everything is as comprehensive as it aught to be? - User:Angry_Candy.</p>

<dd>Seems good to me. The style of writing is more akin to journalism than encyclopaedic, but I think that's a good thing for entertainment bios, personally. I can't really add anything. I didn't really get along with <i>Attention Scum!</i>. I understand Stewart Lee was still smarting from the shoddy scheduling the series got about five years after it finished. --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 22:22, Jul 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I figure a lot of possible categories are going to be controversial, probably on articles that are already the battlefield for multiple edit wars.

<dd>Sorry for my wrong-end-of-the-stick bit. The "pejorative label" thing threw me a little, you know, the "unfortunate connotation in a name"? I wish you luck with the category and can see it fill up nicely, having only just recently witnessed the back-and-forth thrust of "Alternative medicine" and its talk section. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 21:39, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This sounds like a codex issue. You might want to either: 1. Make sure you are using the most recent wma codex, if you are, then any player that will use it should play wma files, there are several open source ones. Or, 2. download the most recent version of Windows Media Player. This will include the codex, and Jet Audio should use it if it is available. Let me know if that helps, or feel free to email me if there's anything else I can do. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 15:23, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I said that downloading WMP would be the easiest way, if you don't want to do that there are other ways to do it. I take it you tried this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=73C47878-20D0-4C1A-96F4-177D7E0074B7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=73C47878-20D0-4C1A-96F4-177D7E0074B7" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and it told you to install the latest WMP? <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli" rel="nofollow">This</a> is an open source version of WMP, which may install the latest codec - could you point me to a link which has the file and I could take a look? Otherwise try installing the latest version of some other open source media players - generally they will update the codecs when they install and other players will be able to see and use them. The most difficult thing is to manually install them.

<p>Thats ok, i didn't mean it in bad faith neither. Sorry. At least on the bright side, it has a sense of infamy for folk who do take it the wrong way. And people so rarely read that stuff unless they contribute to the page. Nowt to worry about. The way I saw it, you were being sarcastic towards me, which I took in good humour (and i actually did check out yer page, took one look at that picture and decided it probobly WAS good natured sarcasm), and I responded appropriately.

<p>Yeah, it seems quite petty on his part. I mean, why bother deleating what you put, when other people have put stuff of a similar nature. I think if anyone in history stands out as a questionable hero it must be Napoleon. The only people i can think of who would praise him are the French, and even then he crippled their economy. Maybe that guy is American and just dosn't get the severity of Napoleon's potential. He could kiss the precious American Ideal of 'Liberty' goodbye had Napoleon not been stopped by Wellington (a REAL hero, though certainly not infallable) --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 17:46, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't really know much about Napoleon. Certainly not enough to know whether I would think he were basically a good man or basically a bad man. So all the stuff I wrote was from a neutral starting point. But I think I like Napoleon slightly less since that minor argument over the <i>popular culture</i> section. &#160;;o) --<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod">bodnotbod</a> 17:52, Jul 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I believe that the correct forms for article titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Harmsworth%2C_1st_Viscount_Northcliffe_9219.html" title="Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe">Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In the articles themselves, the above forms (with the middle names included, if you like) should be used for the first line. Thereafter, however, the individual should be referred to as "Lord Northcliffe/ Rothermere" (unless, of course, one is writing about the individual before he became a peer). The rule of referring to "Lord X" applies to all peers, other than Dukes. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 19:32, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm no expert on <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_theory.html" title="Attachment theory">Attachment theory</a>, but your page seems very well written and is a good summary of the strange situation. My only suggestion would be more on Bowlby's original work, and perhaps even Harry Harlow's work with monkeys and subsequent criticisms. I'll go about looking some of this stuff up if I get a chance.</p>
<p>As regards to your query on neuroimaging...</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been wondering recently about why it is that we routinely X-ray people for internal physical problems but rarely brain scan people with behavioural difficulties or mental illness. Am I right in assuming it's largely a matter of cost?</dd>
</dl>
<p>It can be a matter of cost, but largely it's because they do different things and scans are routinely used in hospitals for the purpose of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Mental illnesses and behavioural difficulties tend to be diagnosed on behaviour, so a brain scan wouldn't be useful in making a positive diagnosis (although they might use it to rule out another diagnosis, i.e. to make sure the behaviour wasn't the result of a brain injury). Also, although some differences in structure and function have been found between the brains of people diagnosed with certain mental illnesses and those without, these are not reliable (some people with these mental illnesses will not show these differences) and so tend only be investigated by researchers interested in exploring brain function. Of course, this may change in the future, but this seems to be the current state of play.</p>

<dd>If you'll forgive a further butt-in, and as you're concerned about reaction, I'm not sure most people would classify "epilepsy" or "mental retardation" as "mental illness", and many think that George III's illness was physical (porphyria) albeit with behavioural symptoms. By actual scientific measures (inbreeding coefficients) the House of Windsor's degree of inbreeding is not particularly notable. See <a href="http://members.aol.com/eurostamm/ahnen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/eurostamm/ahnen.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for <i>serious</i> inbreeding. For inbreeding to be of much consideration in physical or mental defects it has to be fairly recent - the marriages of distant cousins are basically irrelevant - except in cases where a specific recessive genetic trait is being examined. And a pattern of institutionization of epileptic or mentally deficient people is perhaps more indicative of society's views toward them than it is of any one family's view. Just stray thoughts!.... - [[User:Nunh-huh|<i><a href="../../../n/u/n/User_talk%7ENunh-huh_50b3.html" title="User talk:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh's talk</a></i>]] 22:59, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

OK what it means is - roughly speaking you do all the 'orrible cleaning up jobs. There are lot's of these jobs to do, which is why we need all the trustworthy people we can get. Job's that I do include:</p>
<ol>
<li>dealing with vandals - this is a thankless task, and you need to be calm, not easily riled, and it helps to have a good sense of humour. I have <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">vandalism in progress</a> on my watchlist and also regulaly watch recent changes looking for vandal edits. I warn nicely, warn sternly, then block if they ignore my warnings. As an admin you get roll back privaleges which allow you to revert vandal edits with one click of a button.</li>
<li>Helping with deleting. This is a nice task as you often get thanked. Non admins post requests for pages deletions on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Speedy deletions</a> or the VP so they can move pages or they've uploaded an image in the wrong file format.</li>
<li>Speedy deletions - I check <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_pages_90db.html" title="Wikipedia:New pages">New pages</a> for very small pages by non logged in users (&lt;&lt;100bytes - these are usually test pages and can be deleted straight away. (also unusually large pages by non logged in users which more often than not contain a test image)</li>
</ol>
<p>Admin jobs that I rarely do:</p>
<ol>
<li>VfD deletions - I used to do these but haven't done any in ages. They are a pain, you need to count the votes,and make a judgement - is there consensus? delete the talk page, delete the page, archive the vfd debate, then remove from VFD.</li>
<li>Page protections. I do protect pages from vandals occasionally but don't personally go in much for protecting for edit war reasons. You can easily see edit wars on recent changes, but you're not allowed to protect pages you involved in. This again is an often thankless task, because you will always protect "<i>the wrong version</i>".</li>
<li>Editing protected pages. You can edit the main page! Cool! You <i>can</i> also edit other protected pages, but you are not allowed to do this for edit war protected pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's about it really. Admins can come in for a lot of stick sometimes, you will probably be accused of being a member of "the cabal" by the trolls, have your user page and user talk pages vandalised, have trouble makers impersonate you by logging in as e.g. BodnotBod, have calls to have your admin status revoked by the likes of IM. You'll also have to suffer a vote -which <i>might</i> go against you. The rewards might not be worth it, but for me, it's nice to be a "trusted" member of the community. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> 18:27, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bod,</p>
<p>I noticed that you were concerned about the deletion of Category:Alcholics. I must say, I hadn't noticed there wasn't any archiving on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> (is that normal?) - discussion on Alcholics was still around about a week a go or so - check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=5300995#Category:Alcoholics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=5300995#Category:Alcoholics" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like there wasn't much discussion. However, it falls into the general purview of concerns over POV categories discussed over at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_31e1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization">Wikipedia talk:Categorization</a> and various previous <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> such as <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay_people_a4ea.html" title="Category:Gay people">Category:Gay people</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of it comes down to the question, "is this a useful categorisation, or is it better served by a list". Various people are using categorising as equivalent to a labeling mechanism, which has particular problems with POV topics when there are no opportunities to discuss shades of grey. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 21:57, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the message. I just want to ensure that a decent policy comes out of all this (if it hasn't already - I need to do seem reading on the various <i>category</i> pages, I've been offline a few days).

<dd>I suppose it's just that I don't normally do things that rub people up the wrong way, and now here I am with 3 categories that people seem to feel are unacceptable. I hope I can chalk it up to categories being a fairly new phenomenon and perhaps I was slow to pick up how they should be used... but it is fairly embarrassing on the day Theresa Knott asks if I want to be nominated for adminship&#160;;o) (I think I'll delay on that for a while...) --[[User:Bodnotbod|<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod"><font face="arial">bodnotbod</font></a>&#160;» <a href="../../../b/o/d/User_talk%7EBodnotbod_b92a.html" title="User talk:Bodnotbod"><font size="0">.....TALK</font><font size="3">Q</font><font size="0">uietly</font><font size="3"><font color="black">)</font></font></a>]] 22:26, Aug 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I suppose I'll just have to laugh it off. I admit I am rather drawn to the seedy/morbid side of life. To me, having a category of alcoholics was a way of me finding my <i>spiritual brethren</i>. With the emphasis on <i>spirit</i>. I was really hoping the category would take off and I'd find all these other characters I wouldn't otherwise have known about.

If this is the current place to discuss it, let me say I agree with one contributor that we could benefit by looking at what other sites (Yahoo was mentioned; and <a href="http://zeal.com/category/preview.jhtml?cid=302562" class="external text" title="http://zeal.com/category/preview.jhtml?cid=302562" rel="nofollow">Zeal</a> should not be overlooked) have done in devising exactly this sort of carve-up of the whole of human knowledge. I have some alternative spreads from other sites listed at <a href="http://mi.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Category" class="external free" title="http://mi.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Category" rel="nofollow">http://mi.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Category</a>. A look at their 2nd-level and 3rd-level subcategories is instructive too, because that leads to ideas about smaller categories that belong in two or more major threads (eg Scottish Schools is part of Education but is also part of Scotland). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Patterson_109a.html" title="User:Robin Patterson">Robin Patterson</a> 00:58, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>No <i>this isn't the place to discuss it</i>! Lord! &#160;;o) If I have everyone over here discussing categorisation on the main page I'll be flooded!

<p>After 4 months,</p>
<ul>
<li>no one has created <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilm_editors_5d16.html" title="Category:Film editors">Category:Film editors</a> (as a child of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a> or otherwise).</li>
<li>2 WP-editors (including me) have put 3 articles on print editors into <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a>, and 3 (including you) have put 5 such articles into <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrint_editors_885b.html" title="Category:Print editors">Category:Print editors</a>.</li>
<li>I blindly re-parented <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a> from <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> to <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_3d94.html" title="Category:Writers">Category:Writers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel some responsibility for not checking, and propose that i move the three (and two subcats of Editors) down to print -- but it would seem to be wasted effort, if the current meaning of "editors" does not last.</p>
<p>I raise that question bcz i think that <i>in terms of categories</i>, the similarities between print editors and other editors (film, video, &amp; sound?) amount to merely a play on words, and a higher category joining them is of no real interest -- in particular, i think the proper parent of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a> would probably be <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_by_occupation_5f1a.html" title="Category:People by occupation">Category:People by occupation</a>, currently a dumping ground, even if many current children of that Cat could be lumped into sub-Cats of broadly similar jobs. It was a reasonable approach to try out, and your doing so is to your credit. (Your motivation of having an orphan to be parent of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrint_editors_885b.html" title="Category:Print editors">Category:Print editors</a>, rather than leave <i>it</i> an orphan was a little sleazy, but clever enough to make that <i>good</i> sleaze!) But IMO it hasn't proven out, and the next scheme to try is:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace the annotation of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a> with roughly the current annotation of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrint_editors_885b.html" title="Category:Print editors">Category:Print editors</a>, adding a dab-style link to a Cat that is suitable for film editors in case any show up;</li>
<li>keepit a sub-cat of <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_3d94.html" title="Category:Writers">Category:Writers</a>;</li>
<li>move the 5 print-editor articles up (instead of the 3 down);</li>
<li>delete <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrint_editors_885b.html" title="Category:Print editors">Category:Print editors</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to see that approach weighed on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a>, and if <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrint_editors_885b.html" title="Category:Print editors">Category:Print editors</a> survives i'll do the appropriate repair as i suggested in an earlier 'graph.</p>
<p>If you agree, you'd be the perfect person to propose deletion; if instead i proposed it, i'd do so without reference to the originator.</p>
<p>I hope you'll forgive me if i've tried to think out the contingencies too far in advance!</p>

<p>That's a good plan too.

<p>in response to Filenames in websites, length of...</p>
<p>Who requests a page to a server (to you), requests an URL (or a URI) not a filename. Usually a server responds to a request by sending a file (but it is not always true). The file name usally (but is usually, not always) is the same of the last part of the URL. If you are creating a website storing its contents in some file on your web server, what you should be aware is to choose filename for this file that are valid for your computer. Valid means more than file length. Note that if you are writing file on a computer that is not the web server and after wrtitten them you transfer to web server, you have better to choose file names that are valid both on your computer and web server. For the client point of view (the person who use the browser and the system where the browser is running) the file name lenght is of no importance in the request. The only important point is the URL he/it is requesting. If a person have to manually type an URL, a shorter and easier URL is better. When he/it wants to save the page to a file he/it needs to choose a file name for his/its file systems. Usually the program suggest a file name based on the title of the html document or on the last part of the URL (which ussually came from the file name on the web server). If this would give a file name that is not valid on such system, it will suggests a different file name. But this is a problem for the client ystem not for the web server system. Nowadays almost all computer should accept long filename (but shortness is always better when not incomprensible). Note that are a lot of computer system and a lot of file system type. The 8+3 length limit of DOS would not be the only problem to address to find a file name valid to every computer (the computer are not only the Personal Computer, and not every computer used the most famous operating system). It will be an unsolvable problems (and years ago it would even worse). So the rule of the internet says that are not the file name that are passed over the internet but the URL. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnyFile_a868.html" title="User:AnyFile">AnyFile</a> 15:42, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you phantom stranger &#160;;o) I will usually try to keep the filename as short as possible, but I also like to have it slightly descriptive. I'll strike a balance. --[[User:Bodnotbod|<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodnotbod_3e32.html" title="User:Bodnotbod"><font face="arial">bodnotbod</font></a>&#160;» <a href="../../../b/o/d/User_talk%7EBodnotbod_b92a.html" title="User talk:Bodnotbod"><font size="0">.....TALK</font><font size="3">Q</font><font size="0">uietly</font><font size="3"><font color="black">)</font></font></a>]] 21:37, Oct 17, 2004 (UTC)</li>
