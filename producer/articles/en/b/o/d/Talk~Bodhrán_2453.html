<p>Could somone put a page for crowdy crawn linked from the mentioning here... I could fill it out then with some info rather than putting a mini article in this one (theres a fair few nice stories about 'crowdy crawn') , ie if you search the internet you won't actually get any relevent sites because 'crowdy crawn' is also used in dialect to mean something like 'micallanious', the reason being that people used their crowdy crawns like a drawer to store misc stuff in... etc. I don't want to stick all this on the bodhran page. cheers (NM) <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.111.8.103.html" title="User:131.111.8.103">131.111.8.103</a></p>

modern bodhráns are usually tuneable. there are different tuning systems and the amount of tuning mechanisms is somewhere between 4-12 in a normal tuneable drum. however there are also some bodhranmaker that put even more mechanisms into their drum</p>
<p>famous bodhranmakers where these tunable drums can be seen are e.g christian hedwitschak (www.bodhranmaker.de) from germany&#160;; seamus o'kane and darius bartlett - both from ireland&#160;; norbert eckermann from austria</p>
<hr />
<p>Pronuciation. This page says "bow-rahn", but bow can rhyme with "go" and with "how", so this is no help. I reckon "Rahn" rhymes with "darn". The <a href="../../../c/e/i/Ceilidh.html" title="Ceilidh">ceilidh</a> page says "Bough-Rawn" - here Bough could rhyme with any of rough, cough, though, through etc - hopeless. And "Rawn" rhymes with dawn not darn. CONFUSED! -- <a href="../../../s/g/b/User%7ESGBailey_9d1e.html" title="User:SGBailey">SGBailey</a> 22:08, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is from Josh Mittleman's Bodhrán website <a href="http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/bodhran/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/bodhran/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, specifically <a href="http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/bodhran/linguistics.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/bodhran/linguistics.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>:</p>
<p>"The earliest extant use of the word bodhrán (v. Dictionary of the Irish Language) comes from an Early Modern Irish (ca. 17th century) translation of a medical manual entitled Rosa Anglica (Irish Texts Society, vol.25). There the word is found glossed as "tabur (i.e. tabor), timpan (i.e. drum)". We have no idea, however, whether it referred to a particular type of drum, or if it did, what sort of drum. The tabor was a particular type of drum in certain times and places. The Irish word timpan does not describe a particular drum; it can even refer to a type of stringed instrument.) Nor do we have any particularly Irish evidence for styles of performance. Frame drums with a bodhrán-type shape appear in continental representations from the 15th century onward, but no one has produced an example showing the double-ended-stick style which defines modern bodhrán technique. [My thanks to Heather Rose Jones for this research.] "</p>
<p>This is at least some evidence that the word existed pre-20th century? --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 19:28, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coming from a cornish music background... The word 'crowdy crawn' which describes essentially the same instrument as a bodhran is a dialect mutation of a cornish language name. (I don't actually know what the original words were), and as the cornish language had effectively died out by the late 1700's this would give an origin of the word somewhere before this time. However it could have been refering to some other object before that, i know that a crowdy crawn was also used as a draw and grain measure and then emptied out if anyone wanted to play. Hence the phrase is also used to mean 'misculanious'. Don't know if this is any help.will look it up when i get home ina few weeks. <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.111.8.97.html" title="User:131.111.8.97">131.111.8.97</a></p>

<p>The bodhran is an Irish frame drum ranging anywhere from 10" to 26" in diameter, with most drums measuring from 14" to 18". The sides of the drum are 3 1/2" to 8" deep. A goat skin head is tacked to one side (although today, synthetic heads, or new materials like kangaroo skin, are sometimes used). The other side is open ended for one hand to be placed against the inside of the drum head to control the pitch.</p>

<p>Hello, friends. – I'm restoring that image, as it's <b>very good at illustrating how the tipper is held.</b> I read the comments when removing the name (privacy concern), and see that Vincent restored the image, but wanted his name there, or didn't want his likeness displayed at all. I think that's fair, and the <i>privacy concern</i> was resolved when he restored his name by direct editing action. The photo was removed again, asserting that it's "advertising". I don't think it's advertising (as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wp:not">WP:NOT for advertising</a>, article 3., but really article <b>2. Self-promotion</b> is more relevant I think) just to have his name present. Referring to <i><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html#Self-promotion" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest: Self-Promotion</a>,</i> I don't think his picture or the band Harmony Glen's page on WP fail the NPOV requirements.<br />

<p>The list of "notable players include" is getting out of hand. I'd like to limit it to, oh, 20 of the most notable, but I'm sure someone's toes will be scrunched by removing a fav. Problem is, some notable players (Ringo McDonagh, for one) don't have articles (<i>you can create one,</i> I hear someone saying), and some obscure players have article links, so that's not a good rule of thumb. I'm open to votes from previous editors of this page for <b>5 of their favoritest players</b> to leave on the list. Consensus rule, not voting, FWIW.

<dd>Okay, we have got to set some restrictions on the <i>Players</i> section other than just "anyone who can be linked to." I suggest we list "notable players" 1) for whom the bodhran is their primary instrument (not whistle players, accordian players, bagpipe players, who happen to tote along a drum, too), 2) who are recorded or written up in third party, reliable media sources (reviews, books, essays), and 3) whoi can be mentioned as having an influence on the Irish Traditional or Celtic Music scene. The list, and the page, is not served IMHO by having as many bodhran-playing yahoos listed as we can fit on the web.

<dd>It's a shame to see it stripped back. I only just added my name and site the other week - mainly because I'm responsible for the growth of the online community relating to the Bodhrán (Bodhránii and now the Bodojo.com Forums) as well as developing the idea for reviews and other editorial content on a dedicated site (now an integral part of the Bodojo project Paul Marshall and I are now responsible for). The Bodhrán is my main instrument, as a percussionist and not a melodic instrumentalist, so it's nice to have a mention in these kinds of places for the work I've done for the community at large to date.--Cat Lake 09:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cat, I can see how you may be notable, but there are two policy/guidelines at work here. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> (not to mention <a href="../../../f/i/v/WP%7EFIVE_99a7.html" title="WP:FIVE">WP:FIVE</a>) mandates that long lists are not what WP is for. Granted there could be 120 notable players that a congress of us old-timers could nominate without complaint, but we still ought not to list 120 players. WP is not an almanac. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTV_bd6b.html" title="WP:LISTV">WP:LISTV</a> also has a number of important criteria when assembling any list.<br />
<br />
Also, please review <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Advertising_and_conflicts_of_interest" title="WP:EL">External links to avoid (conflict of interest)</a> carefully. Regardless of your c.v. and accomplishments (which I will not confirm or deny), <b>writing about or listing yourself</b> is strongly discouraged. I'm presuming that your intentions were other than self-promotion, but the list loses credibility if we let players list themselves. Better to let an unbiased third party write about you on WP.

<dd>It was not primarily to promote myself, not at all, but it was an attempt to ensure WP readers understand how far the instrument has come in the last 100 years and who is responsible for making it more of a mainstream instrument these days. This is currently missing from the WP page on the Bodhrán and there's no mention of it's evolution and the modern design techniques and playing styles used today.--Cat Lake 14:24, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding the last point in response to Cat Lake's message, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidbspalding_e14a.html" title="User:Davidbspalding">David Spalding</a> is correct and spoke very diplomatically as well. Regarding this thread in general, while it may be of benefit to be a little more discerning as to whom is included on the list, I am thankful at least that some person didn’t bitch about my removal of supposedly notable persons who could not even be linked. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 18:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I <b>did</b> bitch about it to myself, but then I <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">chilled out</a> and reminded myself to <a href="../../../d/g/a/WP%7EDGAF_1795.html" title="WP:DGAF">find other things to do with myself</a>.&#160;;) Some eagle-eyed editors might've noticed that I incorporated some notable players into the text sections and removed one or two from the list.

<b>Bold text</b>Sean O'Riada and the Bodhran <b>Bold text</b>I'm surprised Sean O'Riada isn't highlighted in this article. I was under the impression he was very influential in bringing the bodhran to some kind of prominence in ensembles, replacing the drum kit of ceilidh dance bands.</p>
