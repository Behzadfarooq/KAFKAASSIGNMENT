<p>I removed the picture of the pierced vagina, because Wikipedia should be accessable to people of all ages. If your 9 year old wanted to learn about piercings, and all of a sudden that picture came up, you would probably see it as inappropriate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm realise that you are concerned about the image of the pierced vagina and that you personally feel that it might be inappropriate for younger viewers. Unfortunately, Wikipedia does not censor imagery of the human body that is intended for illustrative purposes. We've been through this debate on a dozen <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_modification.html" title="Body modification">body modification</a> related pages, and the image always stays, provided a sexual act is not shown (in other words a picture of a pierced vagina in sexual intercourse is against current Wikipedia policy and would be immediately removed. As one of the chief editors on body piercing related subjects here, the inclusion of appropriate images of human genintalia is acceptable and represents the consensus of many editors who have weighed in on the subject. What you're engaging in right now is considered blanking vandalism, and your argument that the image should be removed is weakened by that vandalism. Please refrain from blanking or censoring Wikipedia content without an appropriate discussion on the talk page of the article involved. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 18:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am against censorship but I think the image should not be included but not due to censorship. It is not illustrating a point in the article but illustrating links. It is use on pages linked to already and I would defend it being there. It is not illustrating text so I think it is unnecessary. <font color="#00AA00"><a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_the_first_17ae.html" title="User:Rex the first"><b>Rex the first</b></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../r/e/x/User_talk%7ERex_the_first_4301.html" title="User talk:Rex the first">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rex_the_first_78d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rex the first">contribs</a></sup></small></font> 10:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I just feel that the picture of a pierced vagina is a bit inappropriate and rather sudden. I was not expecting to suddenly see a female's private parts.</p>
<p>It's not really inappropriate (it's illustrating the topic at hand). It is possibly too sudden and unexpected. On the plus side, it's brightening up a dreary list of links. Also, this page is where <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_piercing.html" title="Genital piercing">genital piercing</a> redirects from- and it would be very appropriate for that page. So I think it's useful and should stay, but it could be removed if people think it's unnesscessary. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunniwhoops_7b6b.html" title="User:Bunniwhoops">Bunniwhoops</a> 17:35, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I also have a problem with the pierced vagina pic,while I agree that wikipedia should not be censored, it just seems really innapropriate to include such a picture in said topic. I believe pictures like this should be alright but on thier apropiate pages where the user knows ahead of time that thier going to see such a picture, here it just sort of pops out at you. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathawk_f102.html" title="User:Deathawk">Deathawk</a> 15:45, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About section 5. Isn't the pain felt with piercings subjective from person to person? Doesn't that make the small passage about pain felt very unencyclopedic? And even if it isn't shouldn't there be a cleanup on the language and spelling and layout of this passage? 01:09, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah - There's no reference for that data, and it's highly subjective and the formatting is incredibly bad. I'm going to remove the content added by user:206.191.69.149. If you look at his talk page, he's got a pile of soft warnings on vandalism, I doubt he's going to be able to back up his claims with a reference (which you better damn well have on information that subjective), even if contacted there. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 05:45, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to suggest removing this section from the "90's fads" catagory. First due to the fact piercing has been around for an extremely long time, and second because the 90's only saw a more flurishing of piercing and tattooing, it is very much carrying into the 2000's.--<a href="../../../a/z/s/User%7EAzslande_9d17.html" title="User:Azslande">Azslande</a> 21:37, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What the hell is a Jacob's Ladder? It's under the Genital Piercing section. I followed the link and all it says is that it "is also a type of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_piercing.html" title="Body piercing">body piercing</a>".

<p>I removed this for two reasons: first, the image summary was inappropriate (if the subject was indeed a "girl" then she shouldn't have been pierced by any reputable piercer to begin with; otherwise she should be called what she is: a woman). Second, the photo was woefully inadequate. I'm sure that there must be dozens, if not hundreds, of Wikipedians who sport piercings.

<dd>I respect your meaning. In my opinion it is/was a nice example showing three different types of piercings. My english is not the best, of course someone should be old enough to be pierced. I also call 20-year-old women 'girls'.

<p>The current images on this page are portraits. If you are showing off your piercings to your best friend, this is fine, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. While I have no particular problem with someone getting their face on a page, the photo needs to highlight the subject matter, and shold have as little extraneous material as possible. Sunglasses, headphones, curtains or other complex backgrounds and wash-out are all problems that prevent the subject matter from taking center stage in a way that educates the viewer.</p>
<p>Some suggestions, if anyone wants to try to upload a good pair (male and female would be good) of facial piercing pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either get a professional to do it, or get a friend who really knows what they're doing with lighting. Skin tones are hard to capture well, especially when the primary subject matter is a hightly reflective material.</li>
<li>Either get a close-up on <i>just</i> the piercings or get very close on the whole face. Don't worry about hair or clothes, they have no bearing on this article.</li>
<li>Remove any extra material that might complicate the picture such as neck-straps, other jewelry, high collar, glasses, headphones, etc.</li>
<li>Prefer a subject who has no tatoos or other body modification in the area so that we're not conflating the topics for the naive reader who may not yet understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps. As it stands the images aren't <i>useless</i>, but they are certainly not as illustrative as they could be. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 05:20, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Understood! What you want to see is pictures of _piercings_, not pictures of _people with piercings_, correct? I can try to hammer that out later. My photographic style isn't usually atuned to taking pictures of people but I can fiddle around for awhile and see if I can come up with anything.</dd>
<dd>I'll make a small gallery of my more suitable results and I suppose we can pick one? I have a female in mind I can take pictures of, she's a friend who will have no problem releasing her face to creative common or completely public domain for the purpose of this encyclopedia. And of course pictures of myself are in the same boat, so that's not an issue. <a href="../../../k/v/i/User%7EKvidell_1fb0.html" title="User:Kvidell">kvidell</a> 22:05, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the gauging is simple enough. Smaller numbers indicate larger sizes. Sizes between 16 to 10 are common, 16 being the smallest in that range and 10 being the largest. Smaller sizes range down to 18 and 20 in my experience---never seen smaller. Large sizes can go up to 00---I don't think there's a triple 0 yet anyway. As to where they originated, who can say?<br /></dd>

<p>I would like to hear suggestions on redesigning this article and cleaning it up a good bit... I am a professional body piercer, so I can help quite a bit. Id like to hear some suggestions and offers to help. I just personally find this article to be very fragmented and just lacking in general. As well, Iv been working on bringing the piercing pages themselves up to date. I would love help, and would love to turn this into a project if anyone would be willing. --<a href="../../../a/z/s/User%7EAzslande_9d17.html" title="User:Azslande">Azslande</a> 18:47, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've been meaning to do some work on this page and the body modification page for some time, but haven't gotten around to it. I'd be more than willing to help in any effort to better this particular region of Wikipedia. This page is a bit of a mess, there being three key issues, as far as I am concerned:
<ol>
<li>The lack of good historical and cultural data on the practice, both contemporary and ancient. Also references to that data. In the past we have had problems with users adding material to <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_modification.html" title="Body modification">body modification</a> related pages after viewing <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a> specials or seeing info-tainment programs, often this data is incorrect or not necessarily relevant to the article. On the other hand users like myself have been adding data to various body modification and piercing articles that in the trade or practice of those two things is common knowledge, but there are very few texts or other reference materials to verify that data in the face of fact checking or in the case of a difference of opinion.</li>
<li>All healing time and aftercare information should be removed or minimised to explain the healing process of body piercing in general terms. Wikipedia is not a how-to guide - the article on <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoplasty.html" title="Rhinoplasty">Rhinoplasty</a> does not include a how-to nor healing time and aftercare, and neither should the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_piercing.html" title="Body piercing">body piercing</a> page or any related pages. If this is an issue, I could see the creation of an additional article <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_piercing_aftercare.html" title="Body piercing aftercare">body piercing aftercare</a> that in general terms outlines common practices for the aftercare of body piercings, if it could be done without endorsing any method in particular. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 00:41, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article as it stands is very skewed toward the modern, western world. Only a couple paragraphs are what is labelled "In ancient times", which is very inaccurate. The article gives the appearance that piercing was some ancient, little-understood practice, that was lost for centuries, until some new-agers rediscovered it and perfected it. <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3a47146" class="external text" title="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3a47146" rel="nofollow">This image</a> tells me that there is much more to be added to this article, and probably much content to be removed (or split off to sub-articles). The current article is basically a how-to for piercing, not an in-depth discussion of piercing's origins, history, uses, practices, etc. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-4 21:10</small></li>

<p>I read the sections on the various techniques of piercing, and I can't make any sense of it, even though I had to learn and practice venipuncture for a hematology class and am familiar with blood collection equipment.</p>
<p>Use of the word "spiritual" in this article doesn't make sense at all. That's a word like "love" that means everything and nothing. Does this mean that people with body piercings are closer to God? Does it mean that getting jabbed with a large bore needle makes you contemplate your mortality? Does it mean that people with piercings are <i>de facto</i> better equipped to understand the supernatural? Tell me, because I don't know. Feelings aren't facts, and this article is heavy on feelings and attitudes. BrianGCrawfordMA 16:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Body piercing and other forms of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_modification.html" title="Body modification">body modification</a> have a long history as spiritual practices. Body piercing is practiced in a manner analagous to <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> in many cultures. In no way is the entry intended to propose that pierced people are "more spiritual" than any other group, the entry is intended to describe that body piercing is practiced by many people, both ancient and contemporary in a spiritual context. What wording in the entry is troubling you? <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 17:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>regarding the sentence "others choose to be pierced as a form of sexual expression and/or for sexual stimulation or the perceived increase in sexual feeling that certain piercings are thought by some to create..."
<ul>
<li>that's pretty iffy. what is a "perceived increase" in sexual stimulation? that's like telling the doctor your foot hurts only to be told it's not your foot that hurts, it's your perception of pain in your foot that hurts.</li>
<li>this sentence can be made simpler. I'd suggest, "Others choose to be pierced as a form of sexual expression, or to increase sexual sensitivity."</li>

<ul>
<li>i'll also offer my thoughts about cleaning up the following cluttered paragraph: "Attitudes toward body piercing have grown more accepting in the West and in other parts of the world. In some areas, certain types of piercings, even those once considered radical, are becoming more accepted. For example, while ear piercing was long uncommon among middle- and upper-class Western males, today men with pierced ears can be seen working in banks and other traditionally conservative settings in some areas, though this is by no means universal. In other parts of the world, ear piercing is still considered inappropriate for males in many settings, as are multiple ear piercings on women."
<ul>
<li>the first and second sentences say the same thing</li>
<li>i'm not sure about the use of an example. shouldn't an example be a specific example, like a famous person in a conservative line of work who has visible piercings? a politician or a CEO or something.</li>
<li>what is the argument of this paragraph? the first half says that people are becoming more liberal in their attitudes towards body modifications. the last sentence says that people's attitudes are not changing. there should be one main point.</li>
<li>to me the thrust of this section is&#160;: body piercing is a practice found all around the world throughout history; it got repressed under in Western cultures in the modern era, but (or therefore) took hold in subcultures; in the western world today, those attitudes and norms which caused piercing to be repressed are changing, resulting in a greater acceptance of body modification.</li>
<li>here's what i'd suggest. something like: "Body piercing is returning to the mainstream of modern Western cultures as attitudes and values change. Piercings that don't conform to cultural norms -- for example, facial piercings or ear piercings for men -- can still be considered inappropriate." (hmm...even this can be improved on...)</li>

<p><i>* Swimming in public swimming pools, lakes, rivers, streams, and <b>oceans</b> as they may be too harsh to promote skin cell healing. Chlorine in swimming pool water may be an irritant. Bacteria, protozoa, and parasites found in non-chlorinated water can lead to infections."</i></p>
<p>I have been told emphatically that the salt of the ocean is actualy good for a piercings healing process. Is this not true?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>I was told by my piercer the other day that the reason swimming in the ocean is discouraged is because of the bacteria in the water, not the salt (which is used extensively to clean the healing piercing). --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 21:14, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A belly piercing is most commonly known as a navel piercing. However, neither of those are "Female genital piercings". There is already a navel link under "Body piercings", so I removed the link under "Female genital piercings".</p>

<p>One of the lines in the current revision is "<i>Stores such as Hot Topic sell H2Ocean. Claire's markets rinses used in ear and body piercing aftercare that have excess chemicals that tend to hinder the healing process.</i>". I'm not too comfortable with that; I don't feel that the names of the stores are particularly relevant. I think they could also be perceived as promoting a specific venue.

<dd>I agree. The store names are irrelevant and the link in the above paragraph to HTOcean stinks of commercial promotion. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 19:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
