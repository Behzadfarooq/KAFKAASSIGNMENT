The <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29_2e74.html" title="Grand Theft Auto (series)">GTA</a></i> series has much in common with <i>Body Harvest</i>, including gameplay that lets the player take control of sixty-plus vehicles, or exit them and fight on foot.</p>
<p>In <i>Body Harvest</i>, players assume the role of a genetically engineered soldier, Adam Drake, who must investigate and eliminate an alien attack force who possesses the ability to travel through time. Possessing this technology himself, Drake must battle in four areas over a 100-year period that covers <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>-era <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java.html" title="Java">Java</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the 1960s, <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia.html" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> in the 1990s, and the near future.

<p>The opening text tells of how an alien force has harvested the population of earth over a 100 year time period. Every 25 years they would land and imprison whole areas in shields that prevented anyone from leaving and any outside help getting in. The aliens would harvest the population of the area within a time limit of four days before teleporting back to their homeworld, an artificially created comet. Greece was the first targeted area, followed by Java, U.S. and finally Siberia. All of the Earth's armies came together in the plains of Central China where they were then annihilated by over a million alien invaders.</p>
<p>The opening cutscene shows Station Omega, an orbital space station containing Earth's last survivors, the year is 2016 and the aliens have returned to destroy the last remnant of the human race. The aliens attack and board Station Omega and begin chasing Adam Drake, the game's only playable character, through the corridors. Even though Adam defeats the initial invaders he is wounded in the process. He is ready to board Alpha I, the time traveling vehicle developed at Station Omega, when more aliens appear and try to force their way into the boarding chamber. The monitors show his colleague, Daisy Hernandez, telling Adam to get into the Alpha I without letting the aliens gain access to it. As the aliens force the door open, Adam dives through the air lock and firing a single shot into the control panel, which closes the door preventing the aliens from pursuing him further. As they escape the station in the Alpha I, they are pursued by Alien fighter craft, but open up a time portal and escape. Meanwhile, back on Station Omega, an Alien is shown holding a drop of Adam's blood and eyes it strangely. Which is a subtle hint as to where Adam's arch nemesis, known only as 'Black Adam' due to his Black coloured armour, appears from.</p>

Gameplay from <i>Body Harvest</i> shown</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each level in Body Harvest requires the player to stop the aliens from slaughtering everyone in the shield area. The player will nagivate the map, usually coming across towns where aliens will teleport in to attack the town.</p>
<p>There is a meter at the bottom of the screen that represents civilian casualties. If too many civilians die for any reason, the aliens will destroy the area. Only Harvester aliens will deliberately kill people, so the player must destroy Harvester waves as they progress throughout the level.</p>
<p>The goal of each level is to destroy the Shield Generator that creates the shield that surrounds each level.</p>
