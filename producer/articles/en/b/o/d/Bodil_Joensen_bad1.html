<p>The daughter of a devout <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> mother and an absentee military father, Bodil grew up in the small village of Hundige near <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>.

<p>Initially, after leaving home at 15, Bodil worked on a farm in a conservative area of Denmark. Her landlord, a farmer called Nielsen, commented, "She was passionate about animals", adding that she was entranced by the sight of animals breeding, an activity she stated she found "wonderful" to help with. She later left to set up her own breeding farm, "Insemination Central", which became popular for her ability to handle aggressive animals such as <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boar.html" title="Boar">boar</a>, and was then ruined by country <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gossip.html" title="Gossip">gossip</a>, spread principally by farmers' wives who were unhappy at the prospect of their husbands working with a young single girl on farm business. Friends commented that she "was never given much of a chance" by such people. She commented later that "9 out of 10 men wanted to fuck me, and their wives hated me."<sup id="_ref-AF_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AF" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Launched in the context of a failing business and attempts to remain solvent in order to keep her livestock and home, her <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career.html" title="Career">career</a> in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a> began at age 17 when she appeared in "light <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_fetishism.html" title="Sexual fetishism">fetish</a>" pornography before establishing herself in the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">subgenre</a> at around age 25. She starred in a number of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_film.html" title="Feature film">feature films</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_film.html" title="Short film">shorts</a> for companies such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_Climax_Corporation_6d71.html" title="Color Climax Corporation">Color Climax Corporation</a>, and for the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornographer.html" title="Pornographer">pornographer</a> Ole Ege, in which she and other actors had sex with various <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a>. Between 1969 and 1972 she starred with animals in over 40 movies.<sup id="_ref-AF_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AF" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In this genre, Bodil drew special attention worldwide as the <i>Boar Girl</i>, a reputation earned from her live performances with swine, as well as her participation in films shot with pigs on her own breeding centre. The movies she appeared in combined a peculiar blend of the "tolerant contemporary Danish society" image and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> rustic <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostalgia.html" title="Nostalgia">nostalgia</a>. Her Danish biography comments of her domestic life: "The scene is classic Rabelaisian more than anything else, harkening back to the Middle Ages when people and their animals often did live in the same house."<sup id="_ref-danishbio_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-danishbio" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The documentary <i>A Summer Day</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>) by Shinkichi Tajiri, shows her living with her animals on her farm during this era, including their care, her affection for them, and her sexual life, to the tune of Beethoven's <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._6_%28Beethoven%29_1031.html" title="Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)">Sixth Symphony</a>. At the time, she lived with "two rabbits, seven dogs, a dozen pigs, some cats, a guinea pig, a mare and a beautiful black stallion named Dreamlight."<sup id="_ref-danishbio_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-danishbio" title="">[2]</a></sup> He commented later<sup id="_ref-AF_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AF" title="">[1]</a></sup> that she seemed a very open warm hearted person "very at home with nature" and that "when she plays her erotic game with the dog or horse, it is not only a sexual curiosity, it is an erotic play with animals she loves and who are devoted to her."<sup id="_ref-danishbio_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-danishbio" title="">[2]</a></sup> It was the surprising winner of the <i>Grand Prize</i> for the X rated film festival at which it premiered, winning Joensen immediate underground celebrity status and drawing attention from other documentary makers as well as tourists towards her expanding farm. She became for a short time, a social and political icon of free love and unity with nature among the left.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodil_Joensen_bad1.html" title="Edit section: Later life and death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later life and death</span></h2>
<p>By the early 70s she had managed to achieve her goal of living on her own farm, along with her daughter and a platonic friend, which she helped finance by allowing <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">sex tourists</a> to visit and make private films with her animals.</p>
<p>Friends comment about that time<sup id="_ref-AF_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AF" title="">[1]</a></sup> that she was "easily exploited by almost anyone with a camera" and that the visitors "just wanted pornography, they didn't care about knowing her". Neighbours, once friendly, turned dark and hostile, forced her to move repeatedly. As the Danish adult industry began looking to other content, Bodil failed to make the transition from porn to other movies, and her financial stability and life began to fall apart. After <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, she experienced a sharp deterioration, undergoing very obvious physical and psychological changes, including depression, first working as a "live show" and "<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_roleplay.html" title="Sexual roleplay">sexual roleplay</a>" girl. By 1980, with little remaining means of income and spiralling <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debt.html" title="Debt">debt</a>, the only work she was able to retain was a hectic routine of small scale live shows most evenings. Tajiri commented, sadly, that "Accepting the 'Grand Prix' at the first Wet Dream Film Festival was the worst mistake we made with our film, but we were too flattered by the response at the time to realize it."<sup id="_ref-danishbio_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-danishbio" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bodil commented in a 1980 interview: {{Things went completely out of hand when 'Spot' died. I started taking <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedative.html" title="Sedative">sedatives</a>. But when someone referred to them as 'loony-smarties' I threw them in the fireplace. Instead I started drinking and eating excessively. I gained 30&#160;kilos. Doesn't look well on something that was going downhill anyway. 'Spot' was a real <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_shepherd.html" title="German shepherd">german shepherd</a> that I got from an animals hospital 10 years ago. She had been beaten. She never became anything but a little, weak dog. I've never been able to talk to other girls. I've always been with men. 'Spot' was my female friend. She understood what I said. Was happy when I was happy. Was sad when I was. When we were alone in the house without light and heat we went to bed together. Shared a biscuit. And then we talked, until we fell asleep. 'Spot' is the only living creature that has loved me for being just me. She didn't expect to get anything back. She soothed me when I was ill. I've experienced a lot with 'Lassie', and like him a lot. But it'll never be the same as with 'Spot'. Lassie has been unfaithful to me. He's an every-girls-dog. 'Spot' was mine. Completely mine. That's why I had such a shock when she died. And started drinking, and eating myself fat in no time. I live with my man for 10 years and my eight year old daughter. Still I feel like the loneliest human being now that 'Spot' is dead. In those days I earned easy money in a tough line of work. I fell and fell. 'When will I reach the bottom?' I often ask myself these days.|<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup>}}</p>
