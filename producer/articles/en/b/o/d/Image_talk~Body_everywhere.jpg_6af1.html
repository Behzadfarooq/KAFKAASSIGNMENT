<p>We know that the image is copyrighted and not released under a freely-reusable licemse.

I suggest we take the time to examine the other <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a> to make sure that it qualifies for all of them. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I can't see how it can be fair use. The point of fair use is that it is used only when there isn't another free image that could have the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This image could be replaced by a different one. The image doesn't depict a particular massacre. It is simply a heap of corpses on the river. It is claimed to be a part of the Nanjing Massacres. This is not easily verifiable - I pointed out some sources that said they thought the casualties were soldiers. But even if we say they are civilians, there are other pictures in the public domain that do show events of the Nanjing Massacres. So there is no need for this picture and thus it cannot be fair use. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 18:35, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This photo was cited as evidence of the massacre by many books and also refuted as such by other books. Therefore it is inherently notable and non-replaceable.

<dd>I take this point, and we do need to be very conservative about "fair use" claims. Fair use is about use, even though our organisation system leads people to believe it is somthing inherent to the media in question.

<dd>An example of a picture that could be fair use would the ditch photo, although like Kelly I think it needs to be renamed so that it can be used without confusion. That is because it shows a notable event that has also been verified by the journal I supplied. Lots of people have heard of the "thousand corpse ditch".</dd>
<dd>This photo in question has no such equivalent importance attached to it, other than it shows dead Chinese people during the war. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 19:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "equivalent importance" is that this very photo has been used as evidence of the massacre in no less than 3 published works (Moriyasu, Young, Chang) and <b>regardless of whether it actually shows dead Chinese civilians</b>, it is irreplaceably and irreversibly a part of the Nanking Massacre historiography and its surrounding controversy. -- <b><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky"><font color="#FF0000">Миборовский</font></a></b> 19:49, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So what if it has been used in those books? It doesn't mean there isn't an alternative to be used. It shows dead corpses, as do many other photos. I don't agree that it is that vital, certainly not to provide the kind of general understanding wikipedia tries to impart. If the photographs were <b>that</b> important, they would have to be individually discussed in the article in great detail. If all they get is a small caption then they cannot be that crucial, can they? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 20:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You certainly know how to trivialise things. It shows corpses that many believe to be of Chinese civilians, and as such was used as evidence of the massacre, while others believe the corpses were Chinese soldiers. People (like your Fujioka Nobukatsu) have written entire pages in their books just to refute the authenticity of this photograph. Newspapers have printed stories (titled something like "New Evidence of the Nanking Massacre!") just based on this photo.</dd>
<dd>It's absolutely ludicrous to claim something is not important just because "it's too short". Have you considered style and format? If not, read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> and find out that pages-long captions (like the Timperley telegraph) aren't good. It is entirely possible to write several paragraphs of information on this and other images, in fact, I may plan to do so, once this silliness is over with. -- <b><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky"><font color="#FF0000">Миборовский</font></a></b> 21:42, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Trivialise"? I'm saying that the picture itself can be replaced. Yes, it shows dead people. But so do many other pictures. Lots of photographs are disputed. If there were one or two disputed pictures, you might have a point. But given that so many are, you can't say the debate alone makes it special, nor the fact it is used. The content of the picture is the important thing. It shows casualties of war (whether military or civlian), as do many other pictures that are in the public domain now.</dd>
<dd>Somehow I doubt that there will be a proper section on photographic evidence in the article. People have asked questions about the photographic evidence many times and each time they're shouted down or ignored. And given your current obsession in labelling critical sources as revisionists and using POV words, I am quite sure any such section written by you would result in the criticism being trivialised.</dd>
<dd>"Silliness"? Oh, yes, it's silly to try to use historical sources correctly when one can throw some nice pictures in to make an article look better.</dd>
<dd>I never said we had to have a massive caption on it. But as I said, if it was that important then it would have been greatly discussed by now. It hasn't, so quite clearly it is basically just another picture showing war dead/war crimes. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 11:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So the photo can be replaced? With what? If you can produce a photo which can "replace" this one...</dd>
<dd>What is "using historical sources correctly"? Ignoring every piece of affirmative source while treating any refutation as the unholy grail?</dd>
<dd>Oh but the picture HAS been greatly discussed by now. What was Fujioka Nobukatsu smoking when he devoted several pages of his book to refute this photograph? What was Iris Chang smoking when she included this photograph in her book? What have we been doing, eh? Pray tell? Wasting time? It's beginning to turn into one huge waste of time, definitely.

You don't need to put another picture in to replace it, merely ensure there is content available that can do the same job.</dd>
<dd>Using historical sources correctly is when one uses caution, rather than throwing things in. Photography is not nearly as clear-cut as many people think in terms of what it shows.</dd>
<dd>No, discussed in the article. I never said it hadn't been discussed outside wikipedia, I said that if it was so crucial to the Nanking article here it would have been discussed in detail. And as I pointed out, many of the photographs have been discussed. But that doesn't mean they're all vital to put in an article.</dd>
<dd>I don't want all photographs in relation to the subject deleted. Both the ditch and slayers pics have a use, as do others. I have questioned the validity of some others though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:32, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why should the ditch photo be used when it supposedly does not depict war crime in Nanking, but Xuzhou? If the only photo used in the article is one that supposedly does NOT depict a war crime in Nanking, this sends a message to readers that there are no such photos, when there are. The "slayers" image is not a photgraphic evidence, only a newspaper clipping. It does not deliver the same information.</dd>
<dd>I think we have already spent too much time energy discussing this very photo, won't you agree? In addition, Wikipedia has a thing called <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systematic_bias.html" title="Systematic bias">systematic bias</a> that prevents various topics from getting the attention it deserves on Wikipedia. You cannot use the current incarnation of Wikipedia as a yardstick to measure what is notable and what is not. -- <b><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">Миборо</a><a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_B_9f1a.html" title="User:Miborovsky/B"><font color="#FF0000">в</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">ский</a></b> 21:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you want the ditch photo to be in the Nanking article, then that means you believe it is part of the massacres. And the slayers picture depicts a photograph - it doesn't matter if it comes from a newspaper clipping. We have spent a lot of time discussing this photograph, but we still need to decide whether it is fair use or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 11:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
