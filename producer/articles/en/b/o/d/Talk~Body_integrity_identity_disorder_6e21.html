<p><i>A few people have an "<a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_integrity_identity_disorder.html" title="Body integrity identity disorder">amputation fetish</a>", feeling that they are not "complete" until they have a certain part amputated.</i></p>
<p>Now isn't there a contradiction if you compare this sentence with what it says at <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_integrity_identity_disorder.html" title="Body integrity identity disorder">amputation fetish</a>? Personally, I've never heard of that sort of thing before, so either explanation sounds absolutely weird.

<dd>Hmm. As far as I know, amputation fetish does indeed refer to those who are into other kinds of body modification (such as scarring, branding, tattooing, piercing etc.) As I understand it's supposed to be a form of control over ones outward presentation, and specifically of ones will over ones flesh. I think the most usual form is to amputate the tip of a finger or something like that. But I am not an expert. -- Cimon Avaro on a pogostick</dd>

<p>Isn't it great that this page is a stub?</p>
<p>Apotemnophilia doesn't have to be a fetish for amputation or be of any sexual nature at all. As for transexuals, the personal image of the own body doesn't compare with how the body really looks. The apotemnophilians often describe their body as incomplete without an amputation and can have a life long suffering keeping the arm, leg, hand (or whatever limb the case may be about). User:85.225.242.160</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree - only this article seems to have been largely written without any input from people with apotemnophilia at all, hence it is less then ideal. As for many similar traits with transsexualism, yes, I completely agree on that; especially the handling of people is extremely similar. And the ICD still lists "transsexualism" right above "fetishism" and "pedophilia"; not quite where it belongs, but to change these things is a Sisyphus' work. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 21:05, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guess you can tell what I work on mostly, however, in several respects, the parallels are striking (although the underlying condition is different; with the open question about those who wish to get rid of sex-related body parts). Unfortunately for apotemnophiliacs, they are about there where trans-people were 30 or more years ago, in other words, in a shitty position. Seems that at least some of those health care professionals who at least work with them are pioneers in working with trans-people, too. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 15:03, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being an amputee isn't the only aspect of BIID! There are people who feel they need to be in a wheelchair. When they go through life they feel like they are "meant" to be a paraplegic, or whatever. I know this because I have this problem. Paraplegic BIID isn't recognised at all compared to amputees. I think this is terrible. Because this isn't recognised, there is no real way of treating it. I heard that DSM IV was going to include BIID in the next publication, but only amputees. Why would someone who wants to use a wheelchair, or live as an amputee, when they physically don't need to need to, be mentally ill? I guess there are two choices with this. Either you are sick in the head and have BIID, or what you do is just plain wrong. I prefer to choose the first option. Although I would never want to place the label of mentally ill on myself, if it is a path towards "treatment" or relief of these feelings I am willing to take it. In the 50s and 60s, transexuals had no "treatment". They had to endure their pain and make do. How is this different to BIID. And then how can amputee BIID be recognised and paraplegic BIID not be? Wouldn't my need to be in a wheelchair be just as valid? Sometimes I feel I would rather be dead than to keep living without a spinal cord injury. Even if I did elect to see a psychologist or a counsellor or something, there is nothing really that could be done, because paraplegic BIID isn't recognised, and no real study has been done on it, there is no real treatment. I believe my only path of treatment is aquiring an SCI, but given the mental health feild's bias on this subject, would this be enough grounds to have them validate surgery? For some people, yes maybe being treated for OCD or something else and having meds works. And maybe for others ignoring it does. I've tried ignoring it. The pain just gets so overwhelming. People discuss and reject my feelings and emotional pain as if these things are a choice. And yet we also agree that my feelings are a form of BIID I "know" I am meant to be a para, and that the way I am now isn't right. So how is it that in this article there is no mention of wheelchair wannabes, and just amputee wannabes? I looked this article up hoping to find more insite into who I am, but was deeply upset to not find any mention of wheelchairs!</p>

<p>How is it out of context? The need to be a paraplegic is still BIID. Note BIID means Body Identity Integrity Disorder it isn't Amputee Identity Integrity disorder.</p>
<p>I have been a BIID ever since I can remember,I have always wanted to be a above knee left leg amputee,I feel I'm tottaly "normal' in all aspects of my life but this one overwhemling desire that only becomes more intense the older I grow.I have sucessfully become a double toe amputee on my left foot which I brought about by injuring my foot which nessitated the amputation of two toes,I have type 2 diabetes so this was a good reason to explain injuries which became infected and would not heal.During the course of the last two years I have injured my leg futher and have found a young sugeron who has agreed to give me a below knee amputation due to diabetic complications.I know this alll sounds tottaly off the wall and insane ,but It's the only "cure" I can find to allivate my decades of suffering from this constant overwhemling need to be "correct" in my own body,soul and mind.</p>

<p>True to oneself is what you want?</p>
<p>I have an AKA left leg since 1979 when I was 24. It was and still is a difficult physical and mental trauma to deal with. It changed my life in many ways. However, to want this to happen to your body is truely perverted and inhuman. Who is going to pay for you to live? Are you going to be able to support yourself as I do? If not, then you have no right to expect society to support you! What you need is a good psychotherapist and medication to help you to see reality because you are sick. If that does not work then you are in need of a neck amputation because your brain is beyond repair! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.19.170.153 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.19.170.153_dd7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.19.170.153">contribs</a>) 8 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I think I understand how you feel, but this is a discussion page of the Wikipedia, and I really don't think that telling people to get "neck amputations" are adequate here. And while I don't suffer from BIID, I am transgender, and I know that a lot of people feel like that about transgender people, too. And so far, neither for BIID nor transgender your recommendation of "psychotherapy and medication" has had any effect. You don't have to like people with BIID (or transgender people) but telling them to go and die just because they upset you is what is really sick, perverted and inhuman. How would you feel if somebody told you to get a "neck amputation" because they are upset by seeing a person missing a leg? Thought so, and people with BIId don't choose to have it any more than you choose to loose your leg. So be so kind and don't hate rant. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 05:09, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly the bit you removed was very badly written, but you ought to be aware that there are indeed several similarities between BIID and TG, particilarly in the reaction of other people to the respective conditions.

<p>My sister told me last night about BIID and I had to do some research on the subject today. I've worked with all different types of people in my life and was so curious about this condition (?).</p>
<p>After reading what everybody wrote I agree with Alex that more compassion and understanding is needed. While BIID is clearly not the norm its interesting how folks seem to react with such disdain about things that are different. I wish more people would first be curious, seek to understand, and have compassion. We have such little tolerance for ideas, people, situations outside of the norm.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes it is easy to want a "quick fix" to complex mental and emotional problems. We go to dr. after dr. looking for answers and help and often times, in my experience, we don't get it. I don't have BIID, but I think we can all relate, to a certain degree, to suffering, being obessessd, feeling different, and having mental thoughts that make us physically sick. I also know how easy it is when you don't get quick answers to want to give up and take drastics measures. I would say to those in that state, be strong and don't let the fact that little research has been done on the topic stop you from getting the support you need. Form a group of like minded peers, create awareness, increase understanding. I can only imagine the pain people with BIID go thru and at the same time feel that it is so permanent to remove limbs that I would want to be open to all possibilities that could alter a BIID mindset before going thru with any removal, no?</p>
<p>I can understand while the person who had lost their leg may be angry or think "how can a person WANT to cut off their leg" when she has suffered so much in her loss. It is clear that she is still grieving and who am I to judge her anger. I just hope that we can expand our minds, reach out to those that are suffering in any form, and listen to their pain and be empathetic. I'm not implying this will make the condition subside, but will they feel more accepted and loved as a result- yes! I always say..start where people are...and not where you think they need to be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Curiousmind (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Curiousmind_59f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Curiousmind">contribs</a>) 18:23, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>While I was watching Primetime tonight about people that have this urge from the time they are little to be amputees--I immediately thought of a possible answer. I know people will think this is crazy, but what if there is such a thing as reincarnation? What if these people were amputees in their previous lives? I think it makes perfect sense. Not that these people should not be treated with an antidepressant or some medication. But at least this could be a possible explanation behind their strong feelings.</p>
<p>If they believe that this could be a possibility and that it could be cured or fixed with medication dampering this urge--it could at least help their suffering. Sometimes not knowing why can drive people crazy. There are people that have psychic abilities, people that can sense ghosts, people that think they can heal. There are so many unusual things that people might be capable of feeling, thinking or doing. We only are using 10 percent of our brains. What if 90% of our untapped brain has capabilities that we just are not aware of? We used to be positive that the world was flat. How did the Mayans know about calendars? Why is their calendar more accurate than our current calendars? Watch the History and Discovery Channel and you will keep an open mind about many things.</p>
<p>Again, I know it sounds crazy, but strange things do exist. Many people are afraid to admit having an open mind for fear of redicule. But, some of the most ingenious of ideas and discoveries were also rediculed at first.</p>

<p>I removed the following from the article</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some individuals, when asked why they want a limb to be cut off, explain that they have three legs and want to have two just like everyone else. The third leg is between the other two. In the building of robots, it is sometimes required that a middle "third leg" be programmed. This third leg does not exist, but it must be programmed in order to have functioning robots that walk on two legs. The middle third leg is a harmonic of the other two. This may suggest that some people are simply aware of their "third leg", which everyone would have to have in order to walk, and that it may not be a psychological pathology per se.</i></dd>
