<p>It's just so cool when stuff like this shows up. It should probably be titled Leg theory in cricket, though, so that I know it's about cricket, and can avoid it, rather than being curious, reading it, and then saying silly stuff in talk.</p>
<p>OK, I am too lazy to look this up and cite references, but even I know that "leg theory"&#160;!= "bodyline". Leg theory had been around for ages before the bodyline series, and was a relatively harmless thing, which never became controversial. Bodyline was leg theory on uppers. Leg theory was a dubiously effective way to get batsmen out, bodyline was a frighteningly effective way to knock them out. Both used leg side fields and focussed on delivering the ball accordingly, but that aside, they were utterly different. A leg theory field was well spread, a bodyline field in close. Leg theory bowling could be at any pace and any length, where bodyline was all about short-pitched fast bowling intended to injure the batsman, or else force him to defend himself in such a way that he got out. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I think you're right, IIRC. Though the original name for bodyline was "fast leg theory". It was definitely an inspiration. Wanna clean this page up? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<p>OK. I was planning to do another heavy theoretical sociology thing tonight, but it's too hot to do hard stuff. There seem to be two possibilities: (a) go through and completely rewrite it from the start, or (b) cross out "leg theory" and write in "bodyline" several times, leaving a reasonable (if stubbish) article on bodyline (which can be moved over to that title - it's vastly more famous than "leg theory"). Option (b) is much better, I think.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_theory.html" title="Leg theory">Leg theory</a> could then become a seperate article which is <i>actually about leg theory</i>, but it's probably better to just describe leg theory as a paragraph in the bodyline article, I doubt that there is enough meat in the subject to merit an entire entry all to itself.</p>
<p>Now, a procedural question: what's the best way to do this? I can just cut &amp; paste, but it would be better to delete <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyline.html" title="Bodyline">bodyline</a> first (it's just a redirect with no history or talk) and then rename this one to bodyline, wouldn't it? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>Still need (a) to include a background para on leg theory, and (b) an explanation of the way that the English use of the the term "fast leg theory" to describe what was, in fact, bodyline led to much misunderstanding - notably the way that the authorities at home in England (in those pre-television days) thought that the Australians were, for some incomprehensible reason, complaining about a perfectly ordinary tactic that had been around for years and issued statements accordingly, which were then interpreted by the Australians as blandly supporting manifestly unfair and dangerous play. Hence the huge controversy. But probably not tonight. If anyone else wants to jump in and do this, be my guest. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 13:44 Jan 20, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>A good article. But shouldn't some mention be made of the fact that bodyline was used as a tactic in series other than the Eng/Aus one? I think (?) it was used in a tour to India (where similar problems arose) and Wiki itself says that the WI used it against Eng in '33. <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_theory.html" title="Leg theory">Leg theory</a>.</p>
<p>Also, what evidence is there that Larwood was 'vilified' in the UK? I daresay he was, but an example of the vilification would be nice (such as the example of the defacing the statue to illustrate Australian ill-feeling) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_Bretton_219b.html" title="User:Monk Bretton">Monk Bretton</a> 00:37, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes; excellent article - but on the origins ... I remember a BBC docu-drama (late 80s?) about Jardine and the the bodyline series. Included a scene where Jardine defended himself to the Australian press by pointing out that he had been at the receiving end of such bowling in English County cricket well before the tour and he hadn't whined. But I can't offer a real source. --<a href="../../../c/j/e/User%7ECje_585e.html" title="User:Cje">Cje</a> 20:57, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Larwood was "vilified" in the UK. The English loved the success of the tour and defended themselves against Australian whinging, although there was unease in the 1933 season as Bodyline was seen in England. Jardine himself was a good player of Bodyline, who made his only Test century when facing it (I think I added this to the article itself). And it is true to say that leg theory had been around before the Bodyline Tests - the difference was that it was bowled much faster and with much greater effect in the Bodyline Tests than it ever had been before. Nor was Jardine universally hated (although many did take a dislike to him). He was determined to act as a Gentleman (according to his own understanding of the term), and his behaviour reflects this: for example, he stood aside as captain rather than let the MCC depose him (or risk selecting him to captain against Australia again). He had a stand named after him at the Oval, where he captained Surrey - the stand was demolished last year to make way for the new OCS stand, so he now only has a block of seats named after him (many other Surrey greats have similarly been honoured), <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 21:09, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sources I've read seem to disagree on the exact words of the quote. Some have it the way it is in the article, but in the documentary I watched Woodfull's son quotes his father as saying: <i>"There are two teams out there, and only one is playing cricket. The other is making no attempt to do so".</i> I'm not sure if there have been any previous discussion on this subject, but should this be mentioned in the article? <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 04:43, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As with any other quotation that was not taped at the time, various versions of it abound (and almost certainly the most polished versions are just that - polished). The exact words are unknown, but the gist most certainly isn't.

<dd>I would disagree. IMHO, we have to make clear it's an unrecorded quote and it's not clear exactly what he said. We don't have have to explain this in detail, just make it clear it's not an exact quote.

<p>I've made several changes, largely with info from the Douglas Jardine article. While none of this is source and I don't really know much about the controvery myself it doesn't really conflict with any info here so I'm assuming it's true. While I know we tend to dislike repeating too much info, IMHO what I added and changed was too important to leave out from this article. Specifically, it appears the Oldfield incident wasn't the direct result of bodyline as it wasn't being used at the time AND it appears even Oldfield admitted it was his fault. (Indeed if you look at the Oldfield picture it doesn't look like they were using bodyline because the catchers/slips are not in the right positions). I've tried to make this clear and fixed the captions as well which appeared to suggest it was the because of the delivery. Potentially Oldfield, intimidated and/or injured by bodyline wasn't batting in his usual style and so it may have indirectly caused the incident however this is a different issue (you can mention it if you want but IMHO it isn't necessary). Also, I think we need to mention that Jardine maintains it was not the intention to injure (this of course doesn't mean it wasn't dangerous) and that he evidently sent sympathies to Oldfield via various channels (according to the Jardine article). I did change the sympathies bit because Oldfield's injury wasn't directly caused by bodyline (as discussed earlier) but the way it was structured suggested it was. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the Lardwood issue above needs clarification especially given this is FA. Was he really vilified in England after the tournament? Jardine doesn't appear to have been. The Larwood article doesn't say he moved to Australia because he was vilified or that he was vilified either. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh for crying out loud... there is a plague of people going through Wikipedia adding "citation needed" tags to every bloody sentence that doesn't have a cite. <b>There are references listed at the bottom of the article - that's where all this stuff comes from!</b> Do we <i>really</i> need to go through and replace all those flaming idiotic "citation needed" tags with an explicit cite to the same book, 50 times in the one article??

<dd>In the County Championship an Experimental Rule was introduced in 1957 that limited leg-side fielders to five, with at most two behind the popping crease. By 1963, and possibly earlier, this seems to have extended to all matches, in the form of Experuimental Note 3 to Law 44. The timing makes me think that it may have had more to do with the difficulties Laker's leg-trap posed for Australia in 1956 than to Bodyline. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 18:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put in something, including Swanton's mention of Bob Wyatt as one of the dissenting players. However I see that earlier in the section we say: <i>The English players first tried their tactic in a first-class tour match against an Australian XI in Melbourne on 18-22 November, a game in which Jardine rested and gave the captaincy duties to his deputy Bob Wyatt.</i> It seems improbable that Wyatt would have employed Bodyline if he was opposed to it, which suggests that either (a) Swanton was wrong or (b) Bodyline was not in fact used in that game or (c) Wyatt was not the captain. Can anyone throw any light on this? <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 22:09, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Afterwards I told Jardine what had happened.</i> - <i>Some of it was Cricket</i>, Frank Browne (Murray, 1965).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>What do people think about the paragraph that has just been added by someone. It doesn't quote its source, and it seems wrong to me. Constantine and Martindale (who made some use of Boidyline on the WI tour of England in 1933) came after Gregory and Macdonald, not before them. Also Gregory and Macdonald made more use of the bouncer than earlier fast bowlers had done, but I've never before seen it suggested that they bowled leg theory. (Their captain, Armstrong, I believe bowled it on occasion to slow down the scoring, but he wasn't a fast bowler.) <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 10:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seems dodgy to me. I'm going to remove it to here pending references to back it up.
<dl>
<dd>It is interesting to note that leg-theory bowling originated in the West Indies shortly before the Great War. It was taken to Australia by fast bowlers Constantine and Martindale with a West Indies touring team. It was then brought to England by the Australians in the persons of the fast-bowling pair Gregory and MacDonald.</dd>

<p>I have a question about the fairuse rationale for the DVD cover image used in this article. The image's pages clearly says that to qualify as fair use, it must be used "to illustrate the DVD in question." That is certainly not the case here. I know we've been getting blasted for fair use violations on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_World_Cup_0976.html" title="Cricket World Cup">Cricket World Cup</a> article the last few days, but I think this is a clear problem.

<p>I see that the importance rating has just been reduced from Top to Mid. That seems too low to me. I can't see how it could possibly be any lower than High. But given that Bodyline was almost certainly the most notorious of all cricket controversies, and that the British and Australian governments got sucked in, with fears being expressed that Australia might even secede from the Empire, then I think it should revert to Top.

<dd>Agree this should be Top importance for WP:Cricket. As noted further above, Bodyline was voted as the most significant event in cricket history by a panel of cricket experts in 2004. The most significant event in the entire history of a sport surely has to rate as Top importance. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 21:39, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, after reviewing the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cricket_Assessment_fb54.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket/Assessment">WP:Cricket Importance assessment criteria</a>, it seems that Bodyline can be rated no higher than "mid" importance under those criteria. So, as illogical as this seems, it is correct under the current assessment rules. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 23:10, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
