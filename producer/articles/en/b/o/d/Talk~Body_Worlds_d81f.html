<p>Proponents for the increased respect and courtesey for the human body point out that the inventors went ahead with the institute without due consideration to alretnative non intrusive methods of anatomy illustration such as digital computer rendered simulation. Computer simulation of the human body would alow much closer and detailed analysis of the human body. Zoom in, see through and body position maneuverability could allow a digitally simulated model much greater detail and content than a physical model ever could. Redistributing the simulations in the form of software over the internet, could further accomplish a broader viewer base and through a much more flexible means without ever requiring the use of bodies. Because of the versatility of software and the development of computer technology today, a virtual model is not only vastly supperior and more available to viewers world wide, but also an opportunity for further scientific development. The lack of a free, open source, world wide available simulation while continuation of plastination, is not only unscientific, but also disrespectfull to the human body.</p>
<p>Wow, what a stupid kneejerk response. Bodies are complex and variable, and the differences are informative and interesting. No computer program could demonstrate the differences without requiring massive numbers of dissections, which are usually only useful for months at a time, rather than the years that the plastination exhibits are good for. If you wish to see the variability in the SMA (superior mesenteric artery) from a scientific interest, the plastinized bodies are invaluable; likewise if your knowledge of the body is not sophisticated enough to know that such differences exist, you may find yourself impressed and overawed by seeing them in situ. Either way, your appreciation will be much higher in viewing the exhibit than it would be in seeing a computer program. That's why medical schools still include cadaver labs, despite the many excellent atlases that are currently available.216.98.236.14 18:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, just saw this exhibition yesterday... pretty incredible stuff. So anyway, where can we index this in Wikipedia?</p>
<p>(text copied from my talk page)</p>
<p>Hi, thanks for writing up the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Worlds_773f.html" title="Body Worlds">Body Worlds</a> exhibits. I was wondering why you put some of the titles in parentheses? Maybe that should be explained. Cheers, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 19:45, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The titles in parentheses were ones where I had no idea what the real name was, and just wrote a descriptive term. If anyone knows the actual names of the works, they're more than welcome to insert them. --<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuronExMachina_820f.html" title="User:NeuronExMachina">NeuronExMachina</a> 04:59, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Does anyone know if this exhibit will be visiting Vancouver?</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this exhibit is in NY? I thought I say an ad for the exhibition to be in NY in February.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think something might need to be added to the section about the exhibit of the pregnant woman. I have seen the exhibition (in Munich) and this was one of two exhibits I had a real ethical problem with. If the woman had really died a natural death of a terminal illness (as is apparently claimed by Hagens, though I don't remember seeing any info to that effect at the exhibition), surely the child could have been saved at eight months gestation. Why would the mother agree to the foetus' inclusion when it could have lived? I think it's much more likely that she was killed in a car accident or similar. Does anyone have any other info on this, or on the origin of any of the bodies?--<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDub8lad1_c1b2.html" title="User:Dub8lad1">Dub8lad1</a> 13:45, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just saw the exhibit today (in St. Paul). They had a sign that said the woman had a terminal illness, and that the baby could not be saved. No further details were given (and that was the most detail given about ANY of the exhibits). --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehcsif_9925.html" title="User:Rehcsif">Rehcsif</a> 02:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"However, Von Hagens does not make the same claim for all bodies prepared by his plastination institute, only the ones exhibited in Body Worlds."</p>
<p>Unless there is any facts or truth that this claim is based on then it is pointless and implies strongly that the Von Hagens may be involved in such activities.</p>
<p>As such, such loaded speculation has no place in a factual article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Controversy remains on the legitimacy of the cadavers sourced from China and Kyrgyzstan. The fact that Von Hagens only states that those used in the Body Worlds exhibits were sourced legitimately says nothing about whether the bodies used by his Institute for Plastination are similarly legitimate. Without that line in the article the implication is that there is no longer a controversy, which is not the case. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 09:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just saw this exhibit in Phoenix. It was absolutely amazing. I must respectfully disagree with the idea that a computer program is superior to real plastinated bodies for anatomical education. The way that whole specimens are posed is artful and breathtaking. I was nearly moved to tears by the praying man. Being able to examine the inner parts of the body so closely (most bodies are not enclosed in glass) was invaluable you just can't get that sort of a spatial understanding for function and position in a two dimentional medium. I also found it superior to embalmmed cadavers, at least to the lay person as there is no odor or decay. I would encourage anyone with actual interest in the exhibit, the process, and anatomical education in general to check out their web site. I can see why the donor list has grown so much. What a wonderful way to give back. 72.201.244.17 02:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)Joolz</p>

Not only is plastination superior to embalmed cadaveric dissections in longevity and smell, but it allows non-manual dissection, which provides much higher levels of detail. The level of detail allowed is extraordinary.216.98.236.14 18:24, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the following from the External links:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Universe Within" caused a disgusted public to see the result of sophomoric understanding of the plastination process, when bodies started oozing fluid during a San Francisco show": <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/05/27/MNG9UCVOCJ1.DTL" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/05/27/MNG9UCVOCJ1.DTL" rel="nofollow">San Francisco Chronicle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have two concerns. First, this link is not directly related to Body Worlds, but rather another unrelated (if inspired) display. Second, the wording used to describe the link violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in that it casts judgement on Universe Within and those who created it, which could be seen to violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
