	    <p><b>Body Worlds</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> title: <b>Körperwelten</b>) is a traveling exhibition of preserved <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> bodies and body parts that are prepared using a technique called <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastination.html" title="Plastination">plastination</a> to reveal inner <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatomy.html" title="Anatomy">anatomical</a> structures. The exhibition's developer and promoter is a German anatomist named <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunther_von_Hagens_b824.html" title="Gunther von Hagens">Gunther von Hagens</a>, who invented the plastination technique in the late 1970s. The exhibition, first presented in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, has been shown in many cities in Europe and Asia. A second exhibition, along similar lines but with different exhibits, called <i>Body Worlds 2</i> opened in 2005. A third exhibition, <i>Body Worlds 3</i>, opened on February 25, 2006, at The <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Museum_of_Natural_Science_7c1d.html" title="Houston Museum of Natural Science">Houston Museum of Natural Science</a>. More than 20 million people have seen one of the <i>Body Worlds</i> exhibits, which together have taken in $200 million <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness. All of the human plastinates are willing donors<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The original <i>Body Worlds</i> exhibit consisted of about 25 full body plastinates with expanded or selective <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_%28biology%29.html" title="Organ (biology)">organs</a> shown in positions that enhanced the role of certain systems. Cased in glass amid the upright bodies are more than 200 specimens showing an array of real human bodies, organs, and organ systems, some having various medical conditions. For example, there are bodies with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosthesis.html" title="Prosthesis">prosthetics</a> such as <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_replacement.html" title="Hip replacement">artificial hip</a> <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint.html" title="Joint">joints</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_valve.html" title="Heart valve">heart valves</a>; a <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liver.html" title="Liver">liver</a> with <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirrhosis.html" title="Cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>; and the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung.html" title="Lung">lungs</a> of a <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">smoker</a> and non-smoker placed side by side.</p>
<p>A curtained-off prenatal wing features a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnant woman</a> who died eight months into pregnancy; her unborn <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a> died shortly thereafter. She is shown reclining and a large flap exposes her insides, with the nearly fully formed baby pushing aside her internal organs fully visible. This section also usually contains unborn fetuses and <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryos</a>, some with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital_disorder.html" title="Congenital disorder">congenital disorders</a>.</p>
<p>The last exhibit hall features a rearing horse and rider. All exhibits are accompanied with detailed descriptions, and audio guides are available with the option of beginner or advanced, for laymen or medical professionals respectively.</p>
<p>The exhibits were featured in a supposed <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a> exhibition in the 2006 film <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">Casino Royale</a></i>, although the actual location for the exterior shots was the Ministry of Transport in <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Worlds_773f.html" title="Edit section: Controversies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversies</span></h2>
<p>The shows have been surrounded by controversy for a number of reasons. Von Hagens prepared some "artistic" exhibits, such as a man carrying his own skin (based on a <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> drawing by <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaspar_Becerra_bda1.html" title="Gaspar Becerra">Gaspar Becerra</a>); a man on horseback holding his brain in one hand, the horse's brain in the other; and a man kneeling in prayer, holding his heart in his hands. These exhibits are seen by some as denigrating the deceased. Some religious groups object to any public exhibition of human corpses. Others accuse von Hagens of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensationalism</a>.</p>
<p>Von Hagens has been repeatedly accused of using bodies from deceased persons who did not give consent, such as prison inmates and hospital patients from <a href="../../../k/y/r/Kyrgyzstan.html" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> and executed prisoners from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. He maintains that all bodies exhibited in Body Worlds came from donors who gave informed consent. A commission set up by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Science_Center_0bc3.html" title="California Science Center">California Science Center</a> in Los Angeles in 2004 confirmed Von Hagens' claims. However, Von Hagens does not make the same claim for all bodies prepared by his plastination institute, only the ones exhibited in Body Worlds. There is also the issue that the children and unborn fetuses included in the exhibition had no way of giving informed consent to the display of their bodies; in the case of children informed consent would have to have been obtained from their parents.</p>
<p>The exhibit has also been accused of perpetuating gender stereotypes.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The male plastinates are presented in active, "manly" and heroic roles (such as ‘the horseman’, ‘muscleman’, ‘the swordsman’, ‘the runner’ and ‘the chess player’) while some of the female plastinates are shown in the context of motherhood, beauty and passivity (such as 'the ballerina' who is actually wearing pink ballerina slippers; 'pregnant woman' a plastinate whose womb is exposed to show her unborn child and 'angel' whose feet are posed as if she were wearing high heels, complete with bits of her feet shaped into stilettos). There are, however, women portrayed as athletes, namely the swimmer, the figure skater and the archer.</p>
<p>Von Hagens maintains strict <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a strictly defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to von Hagens. Because of this, a German press organization has suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition altogether.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, officials of <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a> tried to prohibit the exhibition there, arguing that it violated laws regulating burials and did not respect human dignity. Von Hagens appealed and managed to obtain a temporary injunction allowing the exhibition to take place, but was required to cover the artistic exhibits mentioned above.</p>
<p>The exhibition in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> took place in the rooms of an erotic art museum on the <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reeperbahn.html" title="Reeperbahn">Reeperbahn</a>, the city's red light district. Prostitutes and cab drivers were admitted for free. Von Hagens added a new exhibit, "Early Bird", a man with an <a href="../../../e/r/e/Erection.html" title="Erection">erection</a>.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030902060425/http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_815179.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20030902060425/http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_815179.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Initial objections of a local official to the artistic exhibits were overruled by officials of the Hamburg Senate.</p>
<p>Annoyed with the repeated legal harassment which he encountered in Germany, Von Hagens announced in the summer of 2004 that the exhibition would leave Germany for good. The exhibit has been travelling in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> since then.</p>

Both the man and horse are plastinated, with the man's front and back separated from the rest of his body. This exhibit was covered while the exhibition was in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>, due to a decision of the <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> courts.

<p>This exhibit includes a man, a woman, and a child on top of the man's shoulders. These bodies were prepared by injecting a red dye and plastinating agent into their blood vessels, then using chemicals and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultrasound.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> to dissolve away their flesh and bones.

<p>The financial success of Body Worlds and Body Worlds II gave rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including "The Universe Within" in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, "Bodies Revealed" in <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul.html" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, "Body Exploration" in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, "Mysteries of the Human Body" in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, "Jintai Plastomic: Mysteries of the Human Body" in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, "Cuerpos entrañables" in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and "Our Body: The Universe Within" in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued "Body Exploration" and "Bodies Revealed". The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the counterparty asserts that the human body in its diversity can not be copyrighted.</p>
<p>Such lawsuits have not stopped the competition, though. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from <a href="http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf" rel="nofollow">"Bodies Revealed"</a>, the exhibition went on successfully.</p>
<p>Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRXI" class="external text" title="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRXI" rel="nofollow">Premier Exhibitions Inc.</a>. They started their first "Bodies Revealed" exhibition in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpool%2C_England_b087.html" title="Blackpool, England">Blackpool, England</a> which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their <a href="http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/index-home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/index-home.html" rel="nofollow">"Bodies Revealed"</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/d/BODIES..._The_Exhibition_2cc2.html" title="BODIES... The Exhibition">BODIES... The Exhibition</a> exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
