<p>If JFD does the same, I am willing to remove all material from the Indian influence article that is not associated with the official shaolin temple, grandmaster Wong Kiew Kit, Howard W. French and the Discovery channel. In other words let's hold ourselves to the highest standards for reliable sources in the world on this matter.</p>
<p>Is JFD willing to do so?</p>
<p>Rhetorical questions aside I can accomadate JFD on the opening paragraph in the Bodhidharma article. We have been known to reach compromises despite even more heated debates. If JFD has said that "<i>possibly from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanchipuram.html" title="Kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</a></i>" should be left out then for the third time in this discussion I accomadate the oppositions point of view despite having formidable sources like Encyclopedia Brittanica endorsing my claim.</p>

<p>No further changes are acceptable. I have backed down on more than enough despite the citations.

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Bodhidharma is the 6th century Buddhist monk credited as the founder of Zen.<br />
Accounts from the Chinese Buddhist canon concur that Bodhidharma was South Indian and ultimately settled in the kingdom of Wei where he took as disciples Daoyu and Huike, though they differ on much else, such as the date of his arrival in China.</p>

<p>The above paragraph does not really describe bodhidharma correctly. we need to add that he is considered only by tradition to be the founder of zen and that most of his life story is considered legends. We also need to write what the academic establishment has talked about his life and should not leave that out. As I state again to all of us involved, why should we be pandering to a biased person who is not willing to listen to facts or reason? It's similar to haveing a wikipedia article on space, and then haveing a nut come along and state that "aliens from mars" have been watching us for years and then changing it to accomodate him on his beliefs on aliens. further, The "indian influence on chinese martial arts" is a nutty article written to support his nutty views. No academic person believes that the stories revolving around Bodhidharma are much more than legend. why should we change the article to state anything less? At the same time why should we change "bodhdiharma, the martial arts, and the disputed indian connection" article at all when everything written there is from an academic source? That article is very balanced as it is. NO ONE is stating that Bodhidharma probably existed.... we are all stating that the stories around him are legend and mythology. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKennethtennyson_9c48.html" title="User:Kennethtennyson">Kennethtennyson</a> 22:02, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without a doubt Bodhidharma was a Tamil (either Buddhist Kshatriya or high caste Buddhist, which makes no sense because Buddhism isnt supposed to recognize caste) from Kanchipuram.

<p>I've read speculation that Bodhidharma was Telugu like Nagarjuna, in addition to the identification of Bodhidharma as "Central Asian Persian" by Yang Xuanzhi.</p>

<p>If you had read Tanlin, you'd know he actually writes that Bodhidharma was "of South Indian Brahman stock" (Translation: Dumoulin).<br />
Taoyuan likewise writes that Bodhidharma was "the third son of a great Brahman king" (Translation: Suzuki).<br />
In other words, the canonical accounts do not describe Bodhidharma as Brahmin, they describe is <i>ancestry</i> as such.<br />
Of course, someone well-versed in the literature would already know that.<br />
<br />
Just as they'd know that Zen and Chan are the same thing.<br />
To describe them as different schools is like referring to "the Deutsch and German languages": the sort of mistake made by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kenny</span></h2>
<p><i>he above paragraph does not really describe bodhidharma correctly.</i></p>
<p>You continue Kenny. Wikipedia does not cater to your notions of "does not really describe bodhidharma". Wikipedia caters to the notions of the BBC and the Encyclopedia Brittanica's notions.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>we need to add that he is considered only by tradition to be the founder of zen and that most of his life story is considered legends.</i></p>
<p>The citations say that he <b>is</b> considered. It's called sourcing.</p>
<p>I allowed "traditionally" in "Mehcanism 1" now we're on Mechanism 4, which is different. Mech 1 had me compromising on "traditionally" and the cabal accepting that he is also commonly associated with Kung fu, which he is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that did not materialize.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>We also need to write what the academic establishment has talked about his life and should not leave that out.</i></p>
<p>Conflicting theories of revision&#160;?</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disputed_Indian_origins_of_East_Asian_martial_arts_8976.html" title="Disputed Indian origins of East Asian martial arts">Disputed Indian origins of East Asian martial arts</a> deals exclusively with a pro view of them. The article is linked up with the main Bodhidharma article <b>and</b> we're only replacing two short paras <b>and</b> I have suggested that i withdraw my section highlighting the conflicts within these theories as well.</p>
<p>You take it back to square 1, kenny. try keeping up.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br />
<i>As I state again to all of us involved, why should we be pandering to a biased person who is not willing to listen to facts or reason?</i></p>
<p>I agree. let us not be pandering to Kenny who is not willing to listen to facts or reason, not that he has done much editing except reverts though.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>It's similar to haveing a wikipedia article on space, and then haveing a nut come along and state that "aliens from mars" have been watching us for years and then changing it to accomodate him on his beliefs on aliens.</i></p>
<p>At least your idiotic outbursts are amusing, Kenny. Keep at it. Next time do Cinderella.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>further, The "indian influence on chinese martial arts" is a nutty article written to support his nutty views.</i></p>
<p>Having 80 something sources&#160;?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>No academic person believes that the stories revolving around Bodhidharma are much more than legend. '</i></p>
<p>kenny, kenny, kenny. what do say we put that to test. The one with less references loses and leaves Wikipedia forever.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><i>At the same time why should we change "bodhdiharma, the martial arts, and the disputed indian connection" article at all when everything written there is from an academic source?</i></p>
<p>No one asks you to. The very formidable article should continue.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I know what he said sounded like a joke but Kenny does that.</p>
<p>Anyways. I did not expect the cabal to reach a solution. They attempt not to allow regular articles. Everything has to be a point by point rebuttal or nothing.</p>

<p>Only the cabal remains ike I said they would. Even after me compromising <b>four</b> times they have the shamelessness and the cheek to continue pushing for a point-for-point rebuttal instead of a regular article.</p>
<p>I say put the two paras to poll or something now. Enough is enough.</p>

<hr />
<p>Here's what I would temporarily propose for the intro:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bodhidharma (c. 6th century CE) was the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhikkhu.html" title="Bhikkhu">monk</a> traditionally credited as the founder of <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A1/Ch%C3%A1n.html" title="Chán">Chán</a> (<a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a>) Buddhism in China. Very little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree that he was a <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South Indian</a> monk who journeyed to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_and_southern_China_3d1c.html" title="Northern and southern China">southern China</a> and subsequently relocated northwards. The accounts differ on the date of his arrival, with the earliest account claiming that he arrived during the <a href="../../../l/i/u/Liu_Song_Dynasty_2268.html" title="Liu Song Dynasty">Liú Sòng Dynasty</a> (420–479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liang_Dynasty_95ea.html" title="Liang Dynasty">Liáng Dynasty</a> (502–557). The accounts are, however, generally agreed that he was primarily active in the lands of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Wei_b808.html" title="Northern Wei">Northern Wèi Dynasty</a> (386–534).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>All the refs can be found in Dumoulin's history pp. 87–91 and/or in Broughton's <i>Bodhidharma Anthology</i> 54 ff. (and many other reliable places besides).</p>
<p>However, I would also propose that this intro is getting unnecessarily weighted down with what is, to some extent—and let's call a spade a spade here—specialist crap. As a better way to introduce the figure of Bodhidharma, I would propose we actually not start bandying back and forth in the intro about precisely where he was born, where and when he arrived in the Middle Kingdom, et cetera ad nauseum. I think, instead, that—since an intro is supposed to <i>introduce</i> the significance of a person (or "figure")—we instead simply mention, in the place of the whole "The accounts differ" sentence—a new paragraph that talks about his actual <i>significance</i> to Chan/Zen Buddhists (and possibly Shaolin kung fu practitioners as well, though I personally know essentially nothing about that particular field): how he is considered (and note, I say, <i>considered</i>) to be basically the founder—or rather, reinvigorator, since we mustn't forget <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>—of the style of meditation used in Chan/Zen (壁觀 <i>bìguān</i> or "wall-gazing"); how he is considered to be the first of the Chinese patriarchs; how he is generally accorded a significance second only to Gautama Buddha himself; et cetera.</p>
<p>I propose this idea because we have to think about the reader: no reader who is relatively unversed in the subject and comes to the article in order to actually <i>learn</i> about Bodhidharma wants to be assaulted immediately with all manner of detailed arguments and counterarguments. These should, of course, be present in the article, but in some sort of "Biography" (or more suitably titled) section; not in the intro, which is make-or-break time for any article (in my reading experience).</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? Cheers. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 23:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I also suggest the separate articles about Bodhidharma and martial arts and disputed Indian origins and whatnot no longer be mentioned here; they may be relevant to the figure of Bodhidharma himself, but they're irrelevant to our attempt to get <b>this</b> article into shape, and their mention only seems to be furthering the sides-taking that's going on (as far as I can see, anyhow).

<p>My understanding is that the following paragraph as proposed by <a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> is used:</p>

</dl>
<p>No further edits mentioning revisionist claims are made in the main page itself by the cabal following which I withdraw my section dealing exclusively on the conflicting nature of the revisionist claims. There are articles linked up to the main article which deal with the issues in detail.</p>
<p>I accept a compromise yet again because it is proposed by <a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a>, not a member of any cabal.</p>
<p>If we give this the go-ahead then lemme know.</p>

<p>it's odd, freedom skies, but you keep on stating in here that you accept these changes and yet in the chan and zen articles you keep on removing any mention of the fact that it is tradition that associates him with zen/chan. You also remove any mention of the fact that most of his life story is considered legend. It would seem that if we were to agree to an unblock you would do the same in teh other articles. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKennethtennyson_9c48.html" title="User:Kennethtennyson">Kennethtennyson</a> 02:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think "(c. 6th century)" is more awkward than "6th century Buddhist monk" but otherwise fine.<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJFD_7b10.html" title="User:JFD">JFD</a> 03:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reasons for putting "(c. 6th century CE)" in parentheses rather than integrating it into the sentence are: (a) it follows <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Dates_of_birth_and_death" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia guidelines</a>; and (b) it allows for the use of "CE"—which is absolutely necessary—without having to resort to such an extremely awkward double-hyphenated construction as "6th-century-CE Buddhist monk".</dd>

<dd>In the meantime, any thoughts on my proposal about a second intro paragraph outlining the significance of Bodhidharma to Chan/Zen practitioners (i.e. a paragraph incorporating the basic concepts underlying the legendary material)?

<p>In the meantime, I'm going to consider and/or start working on a second paragraph to flesh out the introduction more (and possibly move the info in the current intro's last sentence further down, into the biographical section); that is, a second paragraph with the basic ideas behind the legendary material, so as to provide more information about Bodhidharma's actual <i>significance</i>.

<p>As long as you keep up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bodhidharma#Accomadating_the_opposition_yet_again" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bodhidharma#Accomadating_the_opposition_yet_again" rel="nofollow">martians and Cinderella</a> routines I cannot say the same of you, Kenny.</p>
<p><i>since you would rather read a book by a lay person rather than a book by a professor of history on google scholar</i></p>
<p>I'll read <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Brittanica_8ec0.html" title="Encyclopedia Brittanica">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>. You have to quit the routine about <b>"lay"</b> people, when you and I have accomplishments that surpass the men in question then we earn the right to call them lay or otherwise. Calling people <b>lay</b> in a serious tone, people from either side of the divide, highlights your mentality.</p>
<p><i>why don't you look at the intro to this book</i></p>
<p>should we hold that to a challenge&#160;? The one who brings more books to the table wins, the one who does not quits Wikipedia forever.</p>
<p>Lemme know.</p>
<p><i>most scholars consider bodhidharma to be just a legend</i></p>
<p>Actually scholars believe stories like eyelids falling off and tea, stories which surround religious figures like jesus Christ, Prophet Mohammed and Siddhartha Gautama exist. Scholars <b>do not</b> believe that Bodhidharma himself as a living and breathing flesh and bones human being did not exist.</p>
<p><i>Zen existed before bodhidharma</i></p>
<p>Buddhism existed before Siddhartha Gautama. The impact of him identifying <i>margas</i> (paths) from a wider philosophy are not undermined. He <b>is</b> the founder of the unique philosophy.</p>
<p><i>you also should get some prozac for your paranoia</i></p>
<p>Despite your suggestion, which no doubt is based on extensive experience, I don't do pills. I'll pass.</p>

<p>Pallavas, with their capital established at Kanchipuram in the 4th cent. CE. The son resides in the capital, capital is Kanchipuram.

<p>If it <b>is</b> a prince from a south Indian kingdom who made it to China by sea, the strongest indication, as endorsed by Encyclopedia Brittanica, is that he was from the capital of the Pallavas -- Kanchipuram.</p>

<p>About 150 years later in CE 527 the great Bodhidharma, a prince-turned-monk, came from India to teach Zen at the Shaolin Monastery. Since then the Shaolin Monastery has become the fountainhead of Zen Buddhism, which is a major school of. Mahayana Buddhism. Bodhidharma left behind as a legacy three great sets of exercise, namely Eighteen Lohan Hands, Sinew Metamorphosis and Marrow Cleansing. Eighteen Lohan Hands became the forerunner of Shaolin Kungfu, and Sinew Metamorphosis the forerunner of Shaolin Chi Kung. "Bone Marrow" in Chinese medical terms is not just the bone marrow in Western terms, but figuratively refers to the nerves. <b>The great Bodhidharma is honoured and worshipped as the First Patriarch of the Shaolin arts</b>, as well as of Zen Buddhism.</p>

<p>The amount of malice you displayed towards bakaman is too low even for you, JFD.</p>
<p>Michael Maggs apperared on the Indian influence on Chinese martial arts article as well. I extended my best regards to him and replied to his every question, I talked to him. i did not subject someone to misbehaviour like you did to Bakasuprman, instead I explained and talked to him.</p>
<p>202.20.5.206 appeared there as well. I talked to him, i made the article neutral to the extent of naming it "Foreign Influence", he replied to previous changes in making the article more neutral by saying he appreciated them.</p>
<p>People related to you in the past came to an article I largely contributed to, what do I do&#160;? I talk to MichaelMaggs and extend my regards to him.</p>
<p>Bakasuprman contributes in your words "the only reliable piece of evidence" (JSTOR) about Bodhidharma and you subject him to abuse.</p>
<p>I never abused your aquaintences. I do get blamed for being combative, stubborn, unreasonable but I was not uncivil to MichaelMaggs, your aquaintence. He came to the article following a conversation with the cabal.</p>
<p>You abused mine, JFD. A distasteful act which highlights your pervese mentality.</p>
<p>I kept it to the cabal of you and Kennthtennyson, the barnstar couple, not to your aquaintences who took intrest in your business. I draw the line there, they are not the cabal but just their aquaintences.</p>
<p>You obviously have other principles of morality, JFD. Low ones.</p>

Bodhidharma put leaves of the bushes in boiled water, and when he drank the water he found he was more alert. His meditating improved. Tea-drinking was introduced to China.</p>
