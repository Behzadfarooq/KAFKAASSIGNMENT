<dd>For example, the tendency for people to raise their eyebrows as one approaches them fact-to-face is usually indicative of esteem. If you walk down the street and encounter someone you don't know then the chances are that neither of you will raise your eyebrows. If you recognise each other, however, even if you do not greet each another, then eyebrows will likely raise and lower. Of particular interest here in a work context is that if one is not rated highly by the other person then that person will not raise their eyebrows, even though one is recognised.</dd>

<p>I think we need a formal reference for this claim - it is not a common, text-book finding, and it could turn out to be a bit of pop psychology. Does anyone know where it comes from? <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 16:38, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Has anyone had a look at the <i>Examples</i> section as it stands at the time of my writing this? Anyone else believes it should either be authoritatively referenced or removed? As mentioned above, sounds like 100% pop culture.--81.42.163.244 02:40, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please dont, I consider it highly accurate and a source is Allan Pease' book "Body Language". But I dont have it here so I cant add it as a source. I assure you, the examples are ok, valid, nice, accurate etc etc...

<dd>There have been three requests to reference this section now. Allan Pease is hardly authoritative in the scientific world, but if you want to put some of his examples in, make it clear that it is his opinion, or state the references he has used. As it is now, it is hearsay. It would be exactly the same as me saying "pointing your finger downwards means you like a person". It is unreferenced and not true. Referencing is not so hard to do. A simple search will reveal a reference for the Pease book if you want to add it, however it is little more then pop psychology, so be careful in your wording before claiming it all as fact. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkleyone_7bb2.html" title="User:Sparkleyone">Sparkleyone</a> 09:03, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So the section stays if I add "According to Allan Pease in his "Body Language" book ..."&#160;? Are there any scientific studies on the subject even to claim any sort of body language as fact? <a href="../../../f/o/a/User%7EFoant_a5c9.html" title="User:Foant">Foant</a> 11:55, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I for one would be happier with it, because at least it tells the reader where you got the info from, allows them to make their own opinion as to the truth of it, and states whose opinion/research it is. And yes, there are studies on body language, gesture and flirting, you would need to read some social psychology stuff, it would be a bit of work but starting with a google scholar search would be helpful. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">See Wiki's verifiability policy here</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkleyone_7bb2.html" title="User:Sparkleyone">Sparkleyone</a> 02:16, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This was last discussed <b>over a month ago</b>. Since then, no action has been taken to properly reference the information contained in the examples section, and indeed the aforementioned reference for this section seems none too credible. Therefore, I am going to remove the section entirely. If, at a later date, there is more evidence supporting these examples, the section should be re-added with appropriate references and citations. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaius_Octavius_Atellus_b1ec.html" title="User:Gaius Octavius Atellus">Atellus</a> 23:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See above for my problem with this article. I fixed various errors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalisation of "Human Courtship".</li>
<li>Reworded the first sentence to include a general statement in reference to human courtship rather than an explicitly Male-Female relationship; I think this is a little close-minded.</li>
<li>I've placed the cleanup template on the top of the page: it needs revision.</li>
<li>I've removed that ridiculously long quote from Desmond Morris; it's not part of this article <i>anyway</i>, and simply cannot be justified. Also, I removed the latter part of the <i>Desmond Morris</i> stuff, it was just too long and jumbly. Even as it stands it doesn't seem to contribute much to the argument and I would suggest deletion of the entire thing, simply leaving a link to <i>Flirting</i> under the <i>See Also</i> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this article is an odd one; the top half is very informative and useful, but it begins to taper off with useless information that is in parts horribly written. I've added the tags to the top of the page because of these reasons. It's an interesting topic, but really needs attention due to the mishmash of content. Hope you can help out, guys. In particular, you should head for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The '<b>Importance of body language in groups'</b> header.</li>
<li>'<b>Examples'</b>, which also needs rewording.</li>

"Some species of humans such as islamic people are especially adept at detecting human body language, both voluntary and involuntary"</p>

<p>Was added to the article in the references section, but it was added without anything being added to the article content and from an anon IP with no other edits so it's not clear what it's supposed to reference. Not sure how reliable a source it is. The website caims to be for the Center for Nonverbal Communication, a nonprofit run by the author of the article. It also has a bio of givens which sounds like he's authoritative enough as a source. But, after an admittedly brief look,I can't find citations of his work or anything that backs up the status of the Center for Nonverbal Communication.

<p>I recently read somewhere, I think it was in new scientist but I haven't been able to relocate it, that there are two main differences between speakers of the "latin language group" and the "germanic language group". 1. Most people seem to believe that the southeners use more hand-gestures, but that is false, they use the same anount of gestures as northeners. The difference is that southeners use their elbows more, i.e. their gestures take up more space. 2. Latins and Germanics differ in what type of words they use the hands to emphasise; in the phrase "the spider climbed upp the ladder" one group will use a gesture at "upp", and the other at "climbed" (or something like that). This can be used to determine the precise moment when a language student has actually started thinking in a new language. (yeah sounds weird, but thats prety much what the text said; I'd love to know what mechanism is in play, wether it is body language picked up from the language teachers or something more fundamental in the structure of the language)--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStor_stark7_2737.html" title="User:Stor stark7">Stor stark7</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStor_stark7_5ac1.html" title="User talk:Stor stark7">Talk</a></sup> 19:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
