<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>any thoughts on my proposal about a second intro paragraph outlining the significance of Bodhidharma to Chan/Zen practitioners (i.e. a paragraph incorporating the basic concepts underlying the legendary material)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consensus among both Eastern and Western scholars is that the <i>Two Entrances</i> can be attributed to Bodhidharma.<br />
The challenge is how to convey the significance of the <i>Two Entrances</i> to Zen without</p>
<ol>
<li>retreading the articles on the <i><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Entrances_07ce.html" title="Two Entrances">Two Entrances</a></i> and <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a></li>
<li>getting unnecessarily weighed down with "specialist crap"</li>
</ol>
<p>The two entrances are the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice, but outlining their significance without getting bogged down in arcana is beyond me.</p>
<p>One could try to concisely distinguish Zen from other schools of Buddhism. Within the historical context of the times in which it arose, Zen was distinguished by its lack of emphasis on textual scholarship. Zen stories arose out of the need to explain practices and traditions and we can see this in the elements which first appear in the "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall," such as the encounter with the Liang emperor. Bodhidharma pretty much tells the Liang emperor that his construction of monasteries and funding of translation are all for naught because they lack <u>principle</u> and <u>practice</u>, the elements of the Two Entrances.</p>
<p>An analogy could be drawn between Bodhidharma's emphasis on principle and practice and the Christian Protestant doctrine of "justification by faith alone" (as opposed to works).<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJFD_7b10.html" title="User:JFD">JFD</a> 03:26, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that trying to explicate (ouch! Bodhidharma and a whole slew of other eminent Zennists would kill me if they heard that word being bandied about) the <i>Two Entrances</i> without, as you eloquently put it, "getting bogged down in arcana" is a rather impossible endeavor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, for a second introductory paragraph, I wasn't thinking of putting anything so precise in. Rather, I was thinking more along the lines of broad concepts that are often viewed (from within the Chan/Zen tradition) as somewhat bound up with and/or largely initiated by Bodhidharma, such as the "lack of emphasis on textual scholarship" that you mention. In other words, things that Bodhidharma was (at least later) seen as having done and that eventually came to be considered especially "characteristic" of Chan/Zen: seated meditation or "wall-gazing" (the former of which, of course, was by no means exclusive to Bodhidharma at the time in China, though it was eventually co-opted by Chan/Zen, as it were); the emphasis on "special transmission" and "pointing directly to mind" (which is connected with the lack of emphasis on scriptures that you mention—though Bodhidharma himself, of course, seems to have had a real thing for the <i>Lankavatara Sutra</i>); and, connected with the "special transmission" schtick, the lineage of Bodhidharma going back to Gautama Buddha (fabricated as that probably is).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All this sort of stuff is, admittedly, largely just made up in later eras—except for the meditational emphasis, which is probably the most important part—but when we're dealing with religious figures who, to one extent or another, founded distinct traditions and whose <b>actual</b> lives are essentially unknown, then the legends and myths and all that brouhaha actually form an extremely important element, I think, in what there is to be said about that figure (e.g. Jesus, Gautama Buddha, Laozi—to move backwards in time and into increasing unknowability).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow ... let me know whatcha think. Cheers. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 19:29, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibid.html" title="Ibid">Ibid.</a></i> is an abbreviation for the Latin term <i>ibidem</i>, meaning "the same place".

<p>Hey all. I removed the bit about crossing the Yangtze on a reed from the Daoxuan bio section, inasmuch as it directly mentions neither reeds nor the Yangtze—the latter being Broughton's sensible and correct inference from Daoxuan's text—and I wore my eyes out checking the original text <a href="http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T50/2060_016.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T50/2060_016.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Anyone have any idea when the reed bit—surely an important part of the bio/legend—first entered the story? I have a feeling it's in the <i>Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall</i>, but I haven't found that text yet. Cheers, and thanks in advance for any assistance. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 22:53, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ha! Found it (secondarily, that is). According to <i>Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850–1850</i>, p. 395–396, the reed business first came up when someone in the 13th century altered the verse accompanying case 1 of the <i>Blue Cliff Record</i>, changing "Thus he escapes secretly across the river" to, effectively, "Thus he escapes by breaking off a reed and crossing the river".

<p>If anyone wants to know, I really care less about Bodhidharma, Buddhabhadra, etc. What piqued my interest was the gesture of goodwill made by the Chinese government in 2002 to invite Jayendra Saraswati (Kanchi Shankaracharya) to China where the Chinese govt really treated Shankaracharyaji very well. This same shankaracharya was jailed by the Indian govt on a large sheet of political lies and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Hindu_444a.html" title="Anti-Hindu">anti-Hindu</a> nonsense. Shankaracharya in the rediff interview noted bodhi and the times of india (a mainsream paper in India, very mainstream) was discussing a movie on him. JSTOR is academic. Also the category Buddhists and then Zen patriarchs is redundant. Zen patriarch implies buddhism, but I kept the cat in my last edit.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 03:43, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is not (necessarily) with the sources; it's with what they say (I can't speak about Zvelebil's article, however, since I can't access JSTOR). The rediff article has Saraswati hinting at one thing (Bodhidharma "went from Kanchipuram to China") and the interviewer, Srinivasan, saying another ("Bodhidharma was originally from Kodungalloor, Kerala"); that's not entirely a contradiction, since Srinivasan also notes that Bodhidharma "was ... a monk at Kanchipuram", but it also undermines the article's authority as a definitive source, because the ultimate conclusion could be that he was not from Kanchipuram but Kodungalloor, insofar as Saraswati only says Bodhidharma "<b>went from</b> Kanchipuram". As for the Times of India source, all we have here is a brief introduction to a play, with the authority thus being vested in an imaginative work (i.e., the play has to be set somewhere, as imaginative narratives must). I admit that "imaginative" is not "imaginary" ... however, it's also not reliable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, the introductory paragraph as it originally stood does not entirely deny origins in Kanchipuram; it simply states that there is doubt as to the issue, which there most certainly is. In fact, the paragraph as it originally stood—which was accepted after a long battle of sorts on this very issue—is saying effectively the same thing that Bakasuprman's revision is, but without introducing fairly unreliable sources. For all of the above reasons, I'm going to change it back. Cheers. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 05:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think it's best and cleanest to just remove the highly speculative "Kanchipuram" from the intro entirely ... and I've done so. Cheers. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 11:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
