<p>Does anybody have viable proof that wearing boxer shorts increases sperm count? (<i>In context from article: 'The temperature inside boxer shorts is much cooler, which is better for a higher sperm count.'</i>) From what I understand, this is just an urban myth, and there's no real difference either way.</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been some studies done, but I don't believe that they found any difference in temperature between briefs and boxers. Perhaps that should be edited to 'some people contend' or something. -<a href="../../../f/i/p/User%7EFipe_d9f8.html" title="User:Fipe">Fipe</a> 02:10, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I personally find it annoying to have my genitals bouncing around with each step I take... feels like I have nothing on. That's one of the reasons I switched back to briefs. Obviously, many guys don't care or it doesn't bother them. Here's another disadvantage: I find it harder to put on pants with boxers, especially jeans (even if they're loose or relaxed fit). With briefs or boxer briefs, you can just slide your pants on, but with regular boxers, you have to stuff the boxer legs down so they sit flat (just like tucking in a shirt). I find that annoying, but again, I guess it doesn't bother most guys. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 21:07, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The wider and thicker waistband found on most boxer shorts compared to other types of underwear has a higher chance of irritating the skin. This can be avoided, whether you wear briefs, boxers, boxer-briefs, or trunks, by tucking your undershirt or any shirt inside your underpants. However, this leads to possible waistband visibility and the increased likelihood of receiving a wedgie. The advantages include: keeping the skin warmer, a neater appearance, and the avoidance of waistband indentation on the skin."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd consider removing this bit from the pro's and con's, I cant say I've heard of anyone that has experienced irritation from the waistband of their underwear. More importantly, I cant think of anyone that would tuck their shirt in to prevent it. The easier solution is of course to go commando... <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonEastham_9788.html" title="User:JonEastham">JonEastham</a> 10:09, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"An erection is much more noticeable when wearing boxers," says the article. A mildly amusing misrelated construction (surely it is the man, not the errection, which is wearing the boxers). In any case, I'm not sure if it's accurate. If you get an errection in tight briefs, the whole front of the underwear can move away from your body, and the genital area can become quite exposed through the leg holes and the top of the underwear. I suppose the solution is to wear briefs with stronger elastic and looser cloth. On the other hand, an errection in flyless boxers may also be quite obvious!</p>
<p>If the article was referring not to wearing only underwear, but to wearing underwear as underwear (below trowsers), it is probably correct. But it should be made clearer.</p>

<p>One advantage is actually for women. They provide a comfortable compromise in outerwear to the short tight styles currently available everywhere and the "granny style" kulots. They are comfy over a bathing suit, doing chores, protecting the "lower buttocks" from sunburn and various other uses. Many stores carry plaid or other "feminine" versions of boxers in the ladies undergarment sections.76.2.209.25 18:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Elizabeth Andrews</p>
<p>This page seems to be concentrated solely on sex. When reading an article about a piece of clothing, metioning how easy it is to see the 'genitalia' is ridiculous. I would expect this to be seen on such websites as 'uncyclopedia'(no offensive, but at the end of the day it is meant to be a humourous website).</p>
<p>Surely the articles advantages and disadvantages should be about how comfortable they are etc. Not how easy it is to have sex with them on!<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_stowers_434e.html" title="User:Ryan stowers">razza</a> 19:12, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the person who posted the image has been banned, although I may be wrong. Someone else want to check it out? Fair enough that you don't want your image on the page.
