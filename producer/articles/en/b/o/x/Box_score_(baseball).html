<p>The line score is a two-line chart that reports each team's <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball%29.html" title="Run (baseball)">run</a> totals by <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings.html" title="Innings">inning</a>, and total runs, total <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">hits</a>, and total <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_%28baseball%29.html" title="Error (baseball)">errors</a> on a line. The visiting team is on the top line and the home team on the bottom line. The terms <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">top of the inning</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">bottom of the inning</a></i> are derived from their positions in the line score. Sometimes, the winning team is bolded or colored for quick-reference. If the home team is already leading and does not bat in the bottom of the 9th inning, that position in the line score will have an "X" instead of a number of runs scored.</p>

<p>(<i>All game references below refer to the box score above.</i>)</p>
<p>At the top of the box score, the editor of a publication may list the time, date, and/or place of the game. In the example, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium.html" title="Stadium">stadium</a>'s name (<i>the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome_d019.html" title="Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a></i>) and city (<i><a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis</a></i>) are listed.</p>
<p>The line score is always listed as part of the box score, usually near the top; it lists the total runs scored in each inning. (<i>The <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> scored two runs in the fifth inning and one in the seventh. The <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> scored two runs in the first inning, one in the fifth, and one in the eleventh.</i> ) Innings are normally grouped in sets of three for ease of reading. The team totals of <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Run (baseball statistics)">runs</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Hit (baseball statistics)">hits</a>, and <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Error (baseball statistics)">errors</a> are listed last, after a separating character such as a dash. The actual score of the game is represented by the first column after the dash; (<i>the Twins won this game four runs to three.</i>)</p>
<p>The batting performances of each player in the game are grouped by team, with the visiting team listed first. Players are listed by last name in the order in which they were listed on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">lineup card</a> for the game, showing all players who enter the game at any point whether they make a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plate_appearance.html" title="Plate appearance">plate appearance</a> or not. Their <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_positions.html" title="Baseball positions">fielding positions or batting roles</a> are normally listed next to their last name. Typically only last names are used, unless two players with the same name appear in the game, in which case a distinctive first initial is also used. When a player switches fielding position, both positions are listed. (<i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Hunter_db64.html" title="Brian Hunter">Brian Hunter</a>, in the sixth position of the Braves' <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28baseball%29.html" title="Batting order (baseball)">batting order</a>, started at <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_fielder.html" title="Left fielder">left field</a> but also served as the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first baseman</a>.</i>) Substitute players are listed where they were placed in the batting order (in cases such as a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_switch.html" title="Double switch">double switch</a>, not necessarily in the position of the player they replaced). Players who had an offensive role only are listed by that role: "<b>ph</b>" if they entered as a <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinch_hitter.html" title="Pinch hitter">pinch hitter</a> or "<b>pr</b>" if as a <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinch_runner.html" title="Pinch runner">pinch runner</a>. Substitutes who enter for defensive purposes and do not make a plate appearance have their fielding position shown and their batting line score shown as zeros. When a pinch hitter or pinch runner remains in the game, his fielding position is also listed. Some box scores will indent substitutes' names to indicate their spot in the order was the same as the non-indented starter's name above it; others will leave all names left-justified. (<i>The Twins' <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Harper_0e0e.html" title="Brian Harper">Brian Harper</a> pinch hit for <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Ortiz_6674.html" title="Junior Ortiz">Junior Ortiz</a> and then remained in the game as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catcher.html" title="Catcher">catcher</a>.</i>)</p>
<p>Batting statistics are displayed to the right of the names in the lineup. At minimum are shown each batter's <a href="../../../a/t/_/At_bat.html" title="At bat">at bats</a>, runs, hits, and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_batted_in.html" title="Runs batted in">runs batted in</a>.

<p>Below the batting orders and line score, the pitching summary is listed. Each <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> used in the game is listed, along with any decision awarded to that pitcher.

</ul>
<p>Other overall game information is shown at the bottom of the box score.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>U</b>- umpire crew (<i>Six umpires worked this game, listed by umpiring position. The <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28baseball%29.html" title="Umpire (baseball)">home plate umpire</a> is listed first, then the umpires for each base in order, then the left and right field umpires, if any.

<li><b>T</b>- time of the game, not counting rain delays or light failure (<i>The game was played in three hours and forty-six minutes</i>.)</li>
<li><b>A</b>- paid attendance (<i>55,155 tickets were sold for this game.</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most box scores also give the temperature, weather, and wind speed/direction.</p>
<p>Other events not shown in the example but recorded in most box scores include <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice_hit.html" title="Sacrifice hit">sacrifice hits</a> ("<b>S</b>"), <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_play.html" title="Triple play">triple plays</a> ("<b>TP</b>"), <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balk.html" title="Balk">balks</a> ("<b>BK</b>"), and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passed_ball.html" title="Passed ball">passed balls</a> ("<b>PB</b>"). Many box scores, to save space, do not list any categories where none of that event occurred in the game. Others will list the category followed by " - None".</p>
<p>In a baseball game, the number of plate appearances for each team must be equal to the number of batters put out, scored, and left on base. A box score is in balance (or proved) when the total of the team's times at bat, bases on balls received, hit batters, sacrifice bunts, sacrifice flies and batters awarded first base because of interference or obstruction equals the total of that team's runs, players left on base and the opposing team's putouts. In other words, the box score is accounting for the number of batters and what became of them (scored, left on base, or put out). If a box score is unbalanced, then there is a logical contradiction and thus an error somewhere in the box score.</p>

<p>The first box scores tended to be vaguely related to Cricket scorekeeping, in that only two offense-oriented figures were presented for each batter: "O" and "R", meaning "number of times put out" and "number of runs scored", respectively.</p>
<p>As fan interest in all aspects of the game increased, the box scores were revised and expanded to include the offensive categories At-Bats, Runs, Hits and sometimes Total Bases; and the defensive categories Put-Outs, Assists and Errors for each batter, as well as a statistical summary underneath the lineups listing extra-base hits, innings pitched, earned runs, etc.</p>
<p>In baseball, if the team scheduled to bat last is leading after 8 1/2 innings, there is no turn at bat for that team, as it would not affect the outcome of the game, so the last of the ninth is usually marked with an "X" as a placeholder in the line score. Some newspapers (and some scoreboards) in those days showed the home team in the top line, resulting in the peculiarity of an "X" placed in what appeared to be the "top" of the ninth. This practice was a carryover from the time when the home team had the choice of whether to bat first or last, another similarity with Cricket. Teams would often choose to bat first, counting on their ability to "get the jump" on the visiting team (as with football teams that win the coin toss), but the potential for the visitors scoring the winning run in the last of ninth was clearly an unsatisfying situation for the fans. The rules eventually required the home team to bat last, but the practice of listing the home team first was carried on for awhile, in some places, even when it did not square with the actual events of the game.</p>
<p>The offensive statistic Runs Batted In was developed in the early 1900s, and was soon being carried in the lineup portion of the box scores.</p>
<p>As relief pitching became more common, a separate "lineup" section for the pitchers was developed, carrying individual Innings Pitched; the number of Hits, Runs, Earned Runs, and Bases on Balls allowed; and Strike-Outs achieved.</p>
<p>By the late 1960s or so, in the interest of space, most newspapers dropped the defensive stats from the lineups, just carrying the list of errors (if any) in the game summary. For a special event, such as World Series play (especially if a local team is involved), newspapers still often print the wider version of the box score.</p>
