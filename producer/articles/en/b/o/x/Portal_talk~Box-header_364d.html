<dd>It seems not to break anything&#160;:) Now what about the excessive use of padding and margins. I really hate all those small adjustments. It makes it difficult to change anything. Specifically I noticed that the vertical spacing is different from the horizontal spacing between boxes. I would like to fix this, but perhaps you can clean this up? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 3 July 2005 11:17 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The spacings are due to the differences between % and em - the two divs which cause both sides to float are set to some arbitrary percentages adding up to between 95 and 99%, which means there's a 5-1% gap between the boxes. This means that the actual difference changes based on browser size. The vertical spacing is defined by the box margins, and it's in em. Basically, it's not the box's fault&#160;:) (or so I believe). You could try setting the divs to equal 100%, or 99.9%, and add a padding-left:???em; to the div which is floated right, to make it more consistent. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> 3 July 2005 23:29 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like that the edit link is now located on the header bar. However, the recent formating changes have had an odd consequence: wherever an image is present in a box, no matter its formating, the text is forced lower. I'm not sure why this is, and I have closely checked it. I'm tempted to revert it now, but I'm hoping Go For It!'s about to check it out. Aside from that, the new edit link is sometimes hard to see, depending on the box header's background colour (cf. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Portal%7EArt_f272.html" title="Portal:Art">Portal:Art</a>).--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 10:59, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I couldn't even see any image formatting glitch. But I did notice that some text was getting forced lower, especially in category and list boxes. It seems to have been caused by the extraneous comment left at the bottom of the page. I've fixed that. Let me know if you still get the glitch. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 14:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes but inconsistently. On main portals like <a href="../../../h/i/s/Portal%7EHistory_fe08.html" title="Portal:History">Portal:History</a> the text is lower against the image, instead of being flush at the top as previously. That same fault appears on this page with example box above. However, on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_34a5.html" title="Portal:Australia">Portal:Australia</a> I see no such glitch and the formatting is the same (I did both). I'm not sure what's causing it, but I dislike it. Perhaps it might be caused by the "text justify" user preference I use, but that doesn't explain why it didn't occur before nor why <a href="../../../a/u/_/P%7EAU_c5ee.html" title="P:AU">P:AU</a> is fine.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 01:50, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually scratch that. It occurs on every portal. The reason it didn't happen on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_34a5.html" title="Portal:Australia">Portal:Australia</a> was because I had subst'd its box-header a while ago (for a reason I forget).

<p>Yes, I think I know what you are talking about now. It looks like the text starts half a line from the top of the image rather than at the very top. However, Mathematics has the same thing, and it's constructed using a different template. Philosophy uses still another markup method. I don't think the templates nor sourcepages are causing it. However the top margin looks the same for text in boxes with images as for the text in boxes with no images. It must be the way the program places pictures. I can't find it in any page source. There is one problem I noticed we're no longer having -- the text no longer overlaps into the image, which used to happen at the top of an image a lot. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 15:36, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I only noticed image-related faults where thumbs were used. I have been discouraging their use, and left hidden comments on several portals warning against them. As for this present fault, it is to wide-spread to let be, so I intend on restoring the previous formatting. Additionally, I've noticed that the edit link being more prominent has resulted in a rise in vandalism; so much so that I've semi-protected some sub-pages. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 05:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, sorry to butt in, but that last revert you made seems to have screwed up the top of some images. Many of them now seem to overlap an image over half a line of text. It's particularly noticeable on the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Portal%7EWeather_b80d.html" title="Portal:Weather">Portal:Weather</a> Portal I made the other day, but I can also see it on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_1c7e.html" title="Portal:Mathematics">Portal:Mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Portal%7ELondon_2fe5.html" title="Portal:London">Portal:London</a>. It doesn't happen on every portal or on every image... hmm... perhaps it is a firefox thing. I can't see the same problem in IE. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicklott_e36a.html" title="User:Nicklott">nick</a> 14:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nor can I (I use IE). Perhaps you can create some screenshots? As I said above, the only image-related faults I've noticed have occured when thumbnails are used.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 15:06, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

I notice you put a div around the top image and that fixed that one, but surely it defeats the purpose of the template system to do that on every image? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicklott_e36a.html" title="User:Nicklott">nick</a> 16:15, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've just installed Firefox, so I ended up not needing the screenshot (thanks anyway!). Using divs doesn't defeat the purpose of the software if it prevents the fault; in fact, their use is advisable given they ensure against it.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 16:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I not sure I understand your last comment cj. The new placement of the editlink is causing a formatting glitch on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_1c7e.html" title="Portal:Mathematics">Portal:Mathematics</a> (the image overlaps the text; at least under Firefox). Are you suggesting a fix, or do we need to go back to the old editlink location? BTW, I think the editlink looked better in the header bar anyway. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 17:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/t/Portal%7EMathematics_1c7e.html" title="Portal:Mathematics">Portal:Mathematics</a> is now fixed. This is not a new placement; it is the location used up until a week ago. Where you see this fault, ensure "|right" markup is replaced with "div" markup for stability. It is for this reason templates used on the Main Page use "div". Having the edit link in the header was logical, yes. However, it was imperfect: aside a glitch, it off-set the heading and (ostensibly) increased vandalism.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 17:20, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i><b>Gitch fix?</b></i> I think I fixed the glitch. I suspect it was being caused by a difference between the way the program places images and how it places text. I've restored the edit button into the header, and have added a slight margin below it to fill the space the text seems to be sneaking into. I've checked all the Top 10 portals, and weather, and it seems to work. Let me know if the glitch shows up on your screen/browser, and if it does I'll take a closer look. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 13:26, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Nick. Go for it! is referring to a separate glitch which forces the text lower when alongside an image, no matter its formatting. It doesn't appear in Firefox, but does in IE - which is used by the majority of users.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 05:00, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I was referring to the text overlap problem, where the top line of text tries to sneak above an image at the top of a section. I thought I had it licked. I'm changing the edit button back, so that we can track that glitch down. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 20:13, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really don't think we should impose this rather new (to en: at least) format on each and every portal using this template. At the very least, a proposal should be made to <a href="../../../p/_/_/WT%7EP_364e.html" title="WT:P">WT:P</a>. Perhaps an alternative template could be created, one exactly like this but with rounded edges.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 17:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks rather crude, in my opinion, particularly given that the curves aren't very smooth. Also, on portals where there's an outer (angled) box—<a href="../../../l/o/n/Portal%7ELondon_2fe5.html" title="Portal:London">Portal:London</a>, for instance—the rounded boxes look very strange. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">s</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">hin</a> 02:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I liked the overall look, but feel that curved edges simply don't fit with the rest of Wikipedia's layout. I also agree that dramatic formatting changes such as this ought to be discussed prior to implementation. <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.131.44.247.html" title="User:72.131.44.247">72.131.44.247</a> 05:00, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It wouldn't hurt to test the round corners for a few days by changing the template, since it takes a page refresh (purge) in order to see the changes on each portal. Because of this, only a fraction of the portals see the change. We can then see what the typical user reaction is on the talk-pages of the portals purged. But we can't get such feedback if you panic and revert in a knee-jerk reaction. You seem to "be bold" whenever it suits you, and to use the "discuss it first argument" when someone else's being bold doesn't suit you. I'm going to change it again, and if there is more than a few complaints (out of the hundreds of users assumed to be looking at the portals), I'll change it back in five days. In the meantime, I'll accomodate any portal maintainers who want their square edges back. Just give me five days, and remember the 3-revert rule. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 13:43, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was awfully flippant and I take exception to your accusation. I'm not the only one to have objected, nor were my reversions panic-driven “knee-jerk” reactions. I’m not opposed to portals using rounded-edges, but I object to it being imposed on all without the slightest attempt to inform maintainers. A better approach would have been to make a proposal on <a href="../../../p/_/_/WT%7EP_364e.html" title="WT:P">WT:P</a> and to achieve some sort of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. I’m also concerned that you haven’t acknowledged the feedback already received (which is fortuitous, given it hadn’t been sought). It’s doubtful that many editors will even know where to comment, so I’m not sure how you intend to gather further feedback. Your argument about the changes not being visible is not accurate, either. If you wish to trial this format, why not use the alternate template you've created on a few portals rather than charging ahead against opposition? And I'm perfectly aware of the 3RR given I've enforced it on several occasions. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 14:38, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never been called "flippant" before! "Defensive", occasionally. But don't worry, if there's feedback, I'll find it. Most portal editors are probably smarter than me, and therefore will be able to figure out where to post, or at least will post somewhere (like on their portal's talk page). Plus, I might learn something while looking around. But since we're on the subject of feedback, I have a feedback question for you: are there any tools for counting the number of hits on Wikipedia pages? Are visits to articles recorded anywhere? This would at least be interesting, if not useful data. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 09:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Change back</b> - Is my vote... it just doesn't fit with the rest of Wikipedia's look. I doubt many others will know to come here, or that maintainers will voice an opinion on their own the portal talk pages. Sulfur 20:28, 11 January 2006 (UTC) (IP 72.131.44.247 above)</li>

<li><b>Revert</b> is my vote too. I was undecided at first, but I think I like the square corners better. Its a more consistent look with rest of Wikipedia.

<p>I agree with your statement concerning the default template forcing portals as a group to be round or square, and as per your suggestion have implemented a template for portal creators who want to try out round corners. See <a href="../../../t/e/c/Portal%7ETechnology_aecc.html" title="Portal:Technology">Portal:Technology</a>. I've also created a template for square corners so that if new round-corner layouts are to be tested via the default template in the future, editors will have a way to bow out of the test. Your idea to move away from the whole default-template concept was a good one, and having more templates will encourage variety in design, and more experimentation. --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 21:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>CJ, I don't agree with your use of the term "resounding" to describe the feedback, as 4 votes is hardly a peep considering that hundreds or thousands of users view these pages. I plan to continue expermenting with layouts (as I can find the time), and to test both round-based and square-based format themes, and will come up with a better approach to testing the next time around. Thanks for the feedback, on both the layout and the testing method, it has been helpful. --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 21:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(Sorry I took a while to respond - Wikipedia's getting too big!) All comments on portals about the change were negative, so use of the word "resounding" was justified. Please try not to be dismissive of those who have commented. It appears to me that general opinion has turned against rounded corners now anyway, after users realised it didn't transfer across the browser array. Be sure to discuss any further experiments. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 14:11, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have changed the float of the edit link to an absolute positioned span with coordinated relative to the parent box.

If anyone have a better idea, please stand up. The problem with float is that it might set an offset of the title up to 4em to the left. <sub>→<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth"><font style="color:#975612">Aza</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 23:16, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently made a change which AzaToth then reverted. I'd like to discuss options for how it might be possible to incorporate this as I think it is important.</p>
<p>Basically, I added &lt;h2&gt; - &lt;/h2&gt; tags around the {{{title}}} parameter. These create a 'level 2 header', such as is automatically created by '==' in wikimarkup. The reason for including such is that these headers are used by screen-reader software for the blind to navigate around to different sections. Without them blind users essentially have to listen to the entire portal page rather than just the particular section they are interested in at the moment.</p>
<p>The problem is that Wikipedia also uses these headers to determine where to place automatic 'edit' links for users who have that option selected in their preferences. I assumed that most portals use __NOEDITSECTION__, the way I do at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Portal%7EFeatured_content_5442.html" title="Portal:Featured content">Portal:Featured content</a>, to suppress the automatic 'edit' links, but apparently that is not the case.</p>
<p>If we add __NOEDITSECTION__ to this template would that suppress them for just this or all pages the template appears on? Do people actually <i>use</i> automatic edit links on existing portals? Could we just remove the manually inserted edit link in this template and use the automatic one instead (which would have the benefit of not showing them for users who have requested that option)? Et cetera.</p>
<p>I have already addressed this issue by adjusting things on the portals I maintain, but I think it would be a good feature to incorporate on all of them if there is some way to work out this 'edit link' issue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 19:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed sometime around the March 18-20 edits that many of the portals lost the right side of the boxes in the right column... almost as if the total width was 101% within another table, but decreasing the main margin width doesn't fix the issue. This happens in N7 but not IE6. Can someone familiar with the template look in to it?

<p>Almost all the portals currently have no margin at all on the left side of the text. I think they have no margin on the right side either, but I don't have full justification turned on so it's hard to tell. It happened a day or two ago. Is this a result of the changes to this page? What should we do to fix it.</p>
<p>I've fixed it manually at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Portal%7ENew_Zealand_e3f7.html" title="Portal:New Zealand">Portal:New Zealand</a> by adding tables around each section and setting "style=passing:5em" in each, but this is both a lot of work and a complication to wiki editing that shouldn't be necessary in very many places. I've fiddled with passing width and bwidth parameters to here at <a href="../../../o/c/e/Portal%7EOceania_box-header_ae2e.html" title="Portal:Oceania/box-header">Portal:Oceania/box-header</a>, but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_34a5.html" title="Portal:Australia">Portal:Australia</a> doesn't seem affected, and it is one of the few portals not to call this page from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Portal%7EAustralia_box-header_196d.html" title="Portal:Australia/box-header">Portal:Australia/box-header</a>.</p>
<p>I see these problems in Firefox 1.0.8 and 1.5.2 running on Kubuntu and XP respectively, also in Konqueror 3.5.2. In Opera (latest version I think) I don't see the borders of any of the portal panes, and the titles are in white, except Portal:Australia looks normal. In IE 6 on XP SP1, all portals look okay.</p>

<dd>P:AU is not affected because I specifically substed the original box-header code to avoid the consequences of experimentation here. This is why the edit links are still located in the boxes on P:AU instead of in the headers. So far as I can tell, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal%3ABox-header&amp;diff=51016428&amp;oldid=51016060" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal%3ABox-header&amp;diff=51016428&amp;oldid=51016060" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> by <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> which caused the problem.

<p>I would like to propose an optional section parameter to this template. This would require to add <b>&amp;section=</b> onto the end of the edit link. If no parameter is input, the extra code will not affect the template negatively. If I knew the If# code, I believe you could only include that if the parameter had a value.</p>
