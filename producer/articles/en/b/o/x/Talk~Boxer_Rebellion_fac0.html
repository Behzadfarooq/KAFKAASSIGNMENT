<p>Education of Chinese students in America? Of overseas Americans in China? Please clarify.</p>

<p>Although it was the German Kaiser Wilhelm II's comment to "make the name German remembered in China for a thousand years...", it was not German troops that fulfilled this comment, but rather Russian troops, when they "behaved like Huns at the Amur River by throwing 5,000 men, women and children into the river to drown." See <a href="http://www.lisburn.com/books/hart_of_lisburn/hart-of-lisburn4.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lisburn.com/books/hart_of_lisburn/hart-of-lisburn4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisburn.com/books/hart_of_lisburn/hart-of-lisburn4.htm</a> (among others).</p>
<p>Thus edit: "German troops came in for criticism..." to become: "Russian troops came in for criticism..."</p>
<p>(to be done by someone with better confirming sources than just the above website)</p>

<dd>Multiple other sources refer to Germain troops. I think your reference errored. Which makes sense... why whould russian troops respond to the German Kaiser's orders?</dd>

<p>I would say the Nanjing Treaty was a catalyst, but not the direct root cause. You can attribute The Boxer Rebellion to so many root causes. The most direct and yet most superficial one is the cultural conflict (Do I sounds like that Harvard professor?). The Qing Court's misjudgetment and mis- (or failed)communication with the foreign nations were also to blame.</p>

<p>Within the paragraph there mentioned an Empress, however, in the overall chinese history, there was only one Empress and definitely not during the Qing dynasty. It is not the Empress but just the Emperor's mother that was interferring with his business to a point where the Emperor had no power at all.</p>
<p>However, she was still not the Empress, yet. (As documents indicate, she wanted to become the Empress but not quite there yet.)</p>

<p>I just added the paragraph to give a little description of the marching from Tientsin to Peking. From what I found out, it is amazing that despite the huge number of Imperial troops and Boxers along the Peiho river, the allies almost took a casully walk (or almost) to reach Peking. The uncomfortables were caused mainly by the heat and water shortage, as well as the densely grown corn fields! The takeaway is that the dynasty was completely corrupted.</p>

<p>I did read a while ago in a Japanese book on history that the Japanese were the only ones not to participate in plunder and rape. An anonymous contributor just wrote that both Japan and the United States refrained from such violences. This will need referencing, but this is an interesting point to clarify.

<p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>The boxers were not uniformed as such and did not carry rifles. As I recall, 'Yihequan' members only embraced hand to hand tactics.</p>
<p>These troops appear to be the elite units that the Manchu gov't formed with special foreign assistance. The guys in the this picture are perhaps connected to the Peiyang Force who fought the Japanese in Korea.</p>

<dd>Well, this picture is labeled as "Boxers" in a quite trusworthy Japanese book I have on the Imperial Japanese Navy: Tōgō Shrine and Tōgō Association (東郷神社・東郷会), <i>Togo Heihachiro in images, illustrated Meiji Navy</i> (図説東郷平八郎、目で見る明治の海軍), (Japanese). Unless we have more details on the actual look and equipment of the Boxers, I suggest this image be kept.

Just for the record, what is the Japanese word for Boxer used in the caption for this picture, and when was the book published?--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 10:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have deleted phrase "old Austrian Maxim gun" in the embassy compound. It had been restored and I have deleted it again for the reasons below: 1. At the time of the rebellion Maxim guns were a world novelty; therefore no "old Maxim gun". 2. Austrians did not use Maxims; their machine gun was Schwarzlose. 3. Finally and most importantly: the gun at the compound, sometimes nicknamed "International Gun" or "Betsy" was indeed and old, muzzle loaded cannon. Nickname came from the fact that the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells - Russian, the crew American. A picture of it can be found here: <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/rcs_photo_project/868.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/rcs_photo_project/868.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/rcs_photo_project/868.html</a>, with the detailed description.

<p>The Belgian Legation (not Embassy) was located east of Legation Street (entering from what is now Tiananmen Square) at the edge of the foreign quarter. The Legation was given up on 22 June 1900, the second day of the siege, in order to shorten the defence lines. The (repaired / rebuilt?) Belgian Legation still exists but is now a guest house (currently no longer for Westerners - see the Lonely Planet Guide on Beijing, 6th edition), across from St Michael's Church. I have had a quick peek at some of the compound (the ubiquitous Beijing Security permitting after some smooth talking) on 13 and 27 April 2006. A couple of snaps are available upon request at dompiak at yahoo dot com. The main building is a rather attractive little red brick manor.</p>

<p>The line in this section "When the Envoy for the German Empire, Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was kidnapped and killed on June 20, the foreign powers declared open war against China" is not completely correct on 2 counts.</p>
<p>1) Ketteler was not kidnapped. He was shot while traveling in a sedan chair on the way to the Yamen (Chinese foreign affairs office) by a Manchu soldier. (Seagrave - "Dragon Lady" p335, refering Fleming p108 and Satow diary Oct 21, 1900)</p>
<p>2) While this did provoke hostilities in Peking, war had already been declared many miles away by the Allied forces at the Taku forts. After the Boxers burnt down the French Settlement near Tientsin on June 14, and with the forts taking on supplies and reinforments in light of the array of Allied warships just off the coast, it was decided to issue an ultimatum on June 15 for the forts' surrender at 2am, June 17. Prior to this, technically, the enemy had been the Boxer uprising, not the Chinese government. When the Allies attacked at 12.45am on June 17, a state of war with the Chinese nation began. At this point, no shots had been fired at the legations in Peking. The American forces did not take part in this initial ultimatum as they were ordered not to become involved militarily in the absence of a declaration of war. (Seagrave - "Dragon Lady" p329-331, refering Ibid., p347)</p>
<p>Due to telegram lines to Peking being cut, the court in Peking did not find out about the ultimatum until June 19, where an order was issued to defend the provinces from foreign attack, one day before Ketteler's murder. In fact, Ketteler was traveling to the Yamen as a result of the news of the fighting arriving the day before and the Yamen's suggestion that foreigners evacuate the capital. (Seagrave - "Dragon Lady" p332, refering Tan p74-75) <a href="../../../k/a/-/User%7EKa-ru_7d66.html" title="User:Ka-ru">Ka-ru</a> 16:34, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be a strong bias in this article towards the western powers and their christians.</p>
<p>I did a small edit, adding that many Chinese 'christians' were simply criminals who used the association with the church to flee Chinese law, further harming the image of christians in China.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For a perspective on this subject, I added 2 sourced statements that address the "irritation" and the anti-Roman Catholic nature of the Boxer Crisis. The problem, it seems, was not as much "criminals fleeing Chinese Law" as Chinese using the extra powers of Chinese law granted to these foreign missionaries to their own ends - for good or ill.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0324_b6f3.html" title="User:Brian0324">Brian0324</a> 18:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The picture on top of the page is likely not depicting boxers, for the very reason that (1) Boxer usually did not carry guns and (2) they did not wear standardized uniforms. The picture may be referenced, but the author of the book has in all likelihood confused a group of reguar soldiers with the boxers.
