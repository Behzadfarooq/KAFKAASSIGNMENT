<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill%2C_Victoria_80da.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Box Hill was first settled by the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatter.html" title="Squatter">squatter</a> <a href="../../../a/r/u/Arundel_Wrighte_4bd3.html" title="Arundel Wrighte">Arundel Wrighte</a>, formerly of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Diemen%27s_Land_bdf7.html" title="Van Diemen's Land">Van Diemen's Land</a>, who in 1838 took up a pastoral lease on the land he had previously explored in the Bushy Creek area. The first permanent settlers, Thomas Toogood and his wife, purchased 5,000 acres in 1841, and Wrighte built a house on his property "Marionvale" in 1844. The Pioneers' Memorial, which can be found in front of the <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_Town_Hall_c695.html" title="Box Hill Town Hall">town hall</a>, is made from a chimney stone taken from Wrighte's original house. It was not until after 1850, however, that Crown lands were subdivided and sold. Traffic along a main road running through the district encouraged the building of a hotel at Box Hill in 1853. Its owner named it the White Horse hotel, and the name was bestowed on the road. In 1861 a post office was opened at Box Hill, the first official use of the name. The postmaster proposed the name, derived from <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_0a17.html" title="Box Hill">Box Hill</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England, near his birthplace.</p>
<p>In 1871 Box Hill township's population was 154 and the district relied on orchards, vineyards and mixed farming. The extension of the railway from <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberwell%2C_Victoria_43f4.html" title="Camberwell, Victoria">Camberwell</a>, to <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilydale%2C_Victoria_42c3.html" title="Lilydale, Victoria">Lilydale</a>, in 1882 included a station at Box Hill but there were also stations at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury%2C_Victoria_15c2.html" title="Canterbury, Victoria">Canterbury</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey_Hills%2C_Victoria_785c.html" title="Surrey Hills, Victoria">Surrey Hills</a>, to the west. They attracted subdivisions and development ahead of Box Hill. Growth came, though, with a school opening in Box Hill in 1887 and the town became the seat of the <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nunawading.html" title="Nunawading">Nunawading</a> shire council, which met at the Box Hill court house.</p>
<p>In 1895 a market was opened near Box Hill railway station, which improved Box Hill's commercial importance. Box Hill was also the starting point for a tramline to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster%2C_Victoria_cb63.html" title="Doncaster, Victoria">Doncaster</a>, which ran from 1889 to 1896. This was the first electric tramline in the southern hemisphere. The 1890s also saw the opening of a gas works, several brickworks and a private girls' high school.</p>
<p>Unlike suburbs closer to Melbourne, Box Hill lacked the web of tramlines which promoted residential development beyond reach of the railway line. In 1916-17 tramlines reached the western edge of what in a short time would be the Box Hill municipality at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burwood%2C_Victoria_b547.html" title="Burwood, Victoria">Burwood</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mont_Albert%2C_Victoria_3184.html" title="Mont Albert, Victoria">Mont Albert</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wattle_Park_d15d.html" title="Wattle Park">Wattle Park</a>. The years after the first world war saw Box Hill's turn for residential growth. A girls' technical school was built in 1924 and a <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_High_School_fc27.html" title="Box Hill High School">boys' high school</a> in 1930. During the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> a boys' technical school was opened.</p>
<p>In 1933, in its eightieth year, the Whitehorse Hotel was demolished. It had been closed since 1921, when Box Hill, prohibited the sale of alcohol in the town area. After the end of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> Box Hill was suburbanised, but <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_South_e723.html" title="Box Hill South">Box Hill South</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_North_356e.html" title="Box Hill North">Box Hill North</a> comparatively undeveloped.</p>
<p>Post war housing expansion included a Housing Commission estate in <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_Hill_South_e723.html" title="Box Hill South">Box Hill South</a>. A district hospital was opened in 1956. The shopping area enjoyed growth and prosperity which, ironically, by the end of the 1950s was putting strain on it: there was not enough space for parking. The development of Myer Eastland and Doncaster Shoppingtown in the late 1960s took trade away, and the shopping centre regained custom by undergrounding the railway line and station and building Box Hill Central on land which included the old market.</p>
<p>In 1954 the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_and_Metropolitan_Board_of_Works_6fbd.html" title="Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works">Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works</a> designated Box Hill as one of five district centres for metropolitan Melbourne. The plan has succeeded in Box Hill. In addition to the shopping centre, the Box Hill TAFE and several office buildings have strengthened its centrality in the region. Apart from commercial functions there are large reserves with ovals in three direction about a kilometre from Box Hill Central. Box Hill South lies between Canterbury Road and Burwood East, about two kilometres square. Its proximity to trams was better than Box Hill North's, and its residential growth was substantially pre and early post war. The Box Hill golf club is nearby and a linear park continues along Gardiner's Creek. There are church educational institutions - <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingswood_College_66e8.html" title="Kingswood College">Kingswood College</a> (Anglican and then Uniting) and the Christian Brothers' Teachers' College and St. Leo's College (1952 and 1957).</p>
<p>In 1971, a <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sister_city.html" title="Sister city">sister city</a> relationship was forged with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matsudo.html" title="Matsudo">Matsudo</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiba.html" title="Chiba">Chiba</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefecture.html" title="Prefecture">prefecture</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>.

To people who live in, or often commute in Box Hill the two shopping centres are still defined as "Central" (Centro Box Hill) and "Centro" (Centro Whitehorse.) There are rumours that the two shopping centres will one day be joined, this would mainly be due to the fact that, at parts, they are only separated by a walkway.</p>
