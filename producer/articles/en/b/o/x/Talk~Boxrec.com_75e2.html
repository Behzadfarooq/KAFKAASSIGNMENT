<p>Boxrec is a site run by an anti Irish racist &amp; bigot &amp; that fact should be included in all references to this site</p>
<p>A disagreement on an internet message board is not a valid source…it’s just a link to an argument on a forum, which they're are million of those on the net...not are valid unless it is backed by a solid source…references usually mean something reliable…like a newspaper, book, magazine…or even a quality news website...they are valid cources…an argument from an internet message board is not a reference that counts, or matters, but I have taken your personal grudge with said website up with Wiki administration!!! --<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:32, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually it is a valid source if it highlights information then its a source of information - each of the page images have been saved so that if the pages are now deleted by Boxrec then they can now be reproduced as evidence. The facts are not solely based within the arguement on a website the facts are based with within law - I will now post a link to the Good Friday Agreement, I hope that that is factually enough for you. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 10:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, but an Internet Message Board is not a valid source...it is not considered a valid source by any type of historian...it is not considered a source by MLA style, or APA...and Internet message board is hersay...nothing more...nothing less...a valid source would be a newspaper article...a magazine article...a book...or some other valid means...arguements on an internet forum is not a valid source recognized by anyone!!!</p>
<p>And you can save whatever you like...it's still not a valid source...which I am certain the Wiki administrators will strongly agree with as well as they require valid sources to back documentation...not an internet flame war source. --<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If this article is about a website then the contents of that website are applicable as a source of information especially as the owner of the website has commented on the issue and can be quoted within the discussion - there are also private messeges which have been sent on this topic - are they valid sources of information?? I consider those to me the same as hand written mail - which down through the years has been a primary source of information for historians. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 10:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
As has been stated...an arguement from an internet messag board is not a valid source...and whatever personal grudge you may have with boxrec it is not a valid claim...As has been stated, I've taken the issue up with Wiki administrators. Now if you want to post material that is relevant to boxrec instead of the personal grudge that you have, which I suspect that you were banned from that site for the exact same thing that you are doing here, then fine, but a beef that you have on some internet message board does not count as a legitimate criticism, but more importantly it does not count as a legitimate source and I will delete any such nonsense that I see until Wiki puts it on complete lock down, like I suspect they will if the nonsense is continued!!!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Here's you a little sketch about sources from a "How to Research" page:</p>
<p>Another way to know what the research is valid is the type of source it comes from. A scholarly journal is more reliable than a magazine. A government document is more reliable than an unknown author or research writer. It is important that the sources used are valid. Information from web sites should have information about the author.</p>
<p>Has the information been updated? What are the dates of the information? The current information is more reliable and more accepted than out-dated material. However, some work is timeless and continues to be valid. Shakespeare, Plato, Aristotle, Emily Dickinson, and others are authors that continue to be valid today.</p>
<p>Some indication that Internet source may not be valid is if there is no date, no authors, and seems to be one-sided. <b>Some information on the Internet has been written by someone who believes what they are writing but has no real authority to write the material.</b> The information should be reasonable and balanced with citations from previous sources used. The information should be objective and other both sides of an issue with reasons why the author is taking the viewpoint.--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The sentence in bold is where you fit in!!!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That does not state that the contents of a discussion forum is not a relavent source of information? There is nothing one sided with what I am writing Who are you to lay down the law on this issue? if you have a problem with it being one sided then alter the detail to balance the article - you don't just delete the whole section because of your POV - that censorship not discussion!! Who are you to say I know nothing about a topic - what are your credentials? You have zero credibility and have no right to censor this page!</p>
<p>This article is about a website and surely the contents of the actually website that this page is about is a VERY GOOD source! As would you say that the John Duddy page on the Boxrec website is a good source? What about the information on the Good Friday Agreement from a government sponsored website - would you consider that a good source? - why did you delete that also?</p>
<p>What you are doing is just pure vandalism - if you have nothing constructive to add to this article then I suggest that you stay off it!! <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 11:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not arguing with you...this is the exact same thing that you did over a boxrec until you was banned from there and now you are vandalising wiki's site by spewing your personal beef with boxrec. I'll let wiki administrator decide what is valid and what is not and if they say that some argument from an internet message board is a valid source then I will leave it, but as you show here you are just on the site to whine about your personal dislike of boxrec and being that you were banned from boxrec you now want to spread your nonsense here...as well as insulting me because you are not getting your way, but as I said...we'll let wiki administrators decide. --<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As anyone who wants to read this can see...you have no authority to make the claims that you have about boxrec...just some grudge that is very, very obvious, which being that wiki, like boxrec, is a very credible site, they will straighten it out if you continue to add the bogus criticism part to the page!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly please use four tiles when you sign off. Secondly I am not banned from any website. Thirdly I have nothing personally against Boxrec I am just reporting. Fourthly I am not abusing or insulting anyone <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 11:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well since you seem to have no idea what a valid, proper souce actually is then below is a few links that will lead you to the proper MLA style, which will show you what a proper, valid source is...and sorry, but as I have stated several times, an arguement from an internet message board does not qualify as a valid source!</p>
<p>Links on what is a valid source and how to cite it!</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/legacylib/mlahcc.html" class="external free" title="http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/legacylib/mlahcc.html" rel="nofollow">http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/legacylib/mlahcc.html</a> <a href="http://www.studyguide.org/MLAdocumentation.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.studyguide.org/MLAdocumentation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.studyguide.org/MLAdocumentation.htm</a> <a href="http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm</a></p>
<p>As you can see from those examples, which there are many, many more that can be found...there are no examples for citing an internet message board...unless documentation comes from a website, personal, or professional then it is not considered a valid source and even in some professional and personal sites...certain things are not reliable either!!!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>USE FOUR TILES WHEN SIGNING OFF OR PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHO SAID WHAT AND WHEN!!!</p>
<p>This is an article about a website - therefore the contents of that website are applicable!!! Like I said Wiki does not state the discussion forums are not relevant sources of information - which in this case it obviously is - its not for you to judge it or to make wholesale deletions <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 12:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;its not for you to judge it or to make wholesale deletions&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Nice statement...the same thing should apply to you! Who are you to say that boxrec has come under criticism...was it in a scholarly journal, or some valid website...or maybe a boxing magazine because what you try to post is not a valid source that is recognized by anyone, but as I said...I've sent the issue to wiki so we'll se who is right about valid sources...LOL!!!!</p>
<p>I've also saved all of the statements that you have made in the two threads that you continue to whine in. In fact...if you do not know what is and what isn't considered a valid source then you should not be trying to make any kind of edits to any page, but it seems that the only thing that you have edited is the boxrec page, where you talk about your grudge toward boxrec for not taking your view about John Duddy and you have edited John Duddy's page! If you had wanted to be inconspicuous you should have left the Duddy page alone because altering both the Duddy page and adding nonsense on the boxrec page that is about Duddy you exposed your agenda...LOL!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;its not for you to judge it or to make wholesale deletions&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>It is when the information is nonsense, which is exactly what your criticism is!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have now broken the Wiki 3 revert rule so you will now be barred - I have rewritten the article, added reference and link for further read- you deleted them without reading them to suit your POV - i am now finished discussing with you and will let others sort it out <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 13:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Read the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources</a></p>
<p>Especially the part about content...a web work is not a message board argument, and I'm pretty sure the 3 revert rule will be looked over in this case, since I contacted wiki several hours ago about the issue. Also it clearly states in the rules that editors should discuss the issue and come to an agreement, which all you want to do is post your little grudge criticism comment instead of posting valid data about boxrec!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 14:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've only read over this argument qucikly, but frm what I can see the Criticism section is fine. He may be linking to a forum, but it is the actual forum of the article, therfore is completly relevant. Its clear for all to see that criticism does exist. As we can see criticism exists, so I'm not quite sure what your point is Ozzwald. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerry_Boi_882d.html" title="User:Derry Boi">Derry Boi</a> 14:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Of course criticism exsists, but it needs to come from a valid source and an arguement from some internet message board/forum is not a valid source. A valid criticism shoould be something that is read in a magazine, a journal, or a professional, or personal website, but not from a flame war that occured on an internet message board!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 14:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
And the references that is posted, well they prove nothing except that Beaumontproject has an issue with boxrec and it his criticism...yet...as MLA and every other style will tell you...some people have no business making such a claim...and that really fits in pertaining to an internet message board!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 14:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He may be linking to a forum, but it is the actual forum of the article, therfore is completly relevant.&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>There is no article on the forum...it is just an arguement between members of the forum...there is no article...it is completely irrelevant pertaining to boxrec. Now if there had been a well written article from some source and it was posted on a message board, well that is different, but what this guy is going by is not an article...he is going by an arguement between himself and other members of the forum--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 14:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me make this clear - I do not have a personal problem with Boxrec and I am not the only person interested in this debate - it seems a new user has join the debate also!! Plus there are hundreds on posts about the issue on Boxrec, East Side Boxing and other boxing related sites. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 15:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Let's make this clear...if you have no issue with boxrec then why do you continue to post the same nonsense over and over without a valid source? This site is a "factual" site...not a forum for you to spread your agenda! The criticism that you post is completely irrelevant in describing boxrec. If you have no issue then you should be able to just move on, but you are dead set to post the nonsense because of your grudge...It's obvious that you are only interested in John Duddy as that is the onlything that you have done on wiki, but in the end...if the rules of the site are an indication...your criticism grudge will only be short-lived! I saw that you have also had problems with the John Duddy page by posting POV material instead of consensual data.--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 15:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Gnevin---Please stop deleting my comments of the Boxrec page...they are facts...at least just as much as the criticism is!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 16:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey...I have no problem with the Criticism, but if it is to stay up then so should the Comment about the Criticism comment only being the view of a couple of people and certainly not the view of all wikipedians...that's a clear way to resolve the issue. You want it up fine, but I want it to be clear that it is only the view of a couple of people...can you live with that, or is your grudge just too bad to have a opposing voice...after all, wiki stresses opposing views in an article! And Beaumontproject, you talk about me just joining the site yet you just joined only a few days ago also and the boxrec page and the John Duddy page is the only thing he has edited.--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 16:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
But as it states in Wiki guidelines...debates from an internet message board does not count as a valid source...now it should be very clear about what is and what is not acceptable sources</p>

<p>There is no reason to have this section in the article without sources <i>outside</i> of the forums. There are over 45,000 topics on the boxrec forums.

<dd>Clan Duddy - John Duddy's management team has issued an official statement on the issue and it has probably been the hottest topic on the Boxrec forum for over 6 months - Boxrecs decision is also discussed on other forums on the internet so it is a topic of some note that people are disscussing especially as Boxrec are attempting to become an ABC recognised record keeper after being rejected last year. So there is an obvious issue and it needs to be highlighted. Yes other parts of what Boxrec does needs to be discussed so why dont you write a section on it?? <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 13:03, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement was made on the forum by Jim Borzell from Camp Duddy and was replied to by Boxrec.com owner John Sheperd - therefore as the posters where named and acknowledged by both side is fulfils the criteria as a reliable source and the source is documented, dated, issued to the public domain, the parties are named and acknowledge and credible sources when discussing this topic.

<p>Not that it matters as the criticism comment has no business on the page to begin with, as I have said from the beginning, but the comment made on the Boxrec forum, that Vintagekits keeps speaking of, was done so by a poster using the moniker "Jabby." Sorry, but even if the source had been a valid one, which it most certainly is not....Jabby would not be a reliable contact and to continue on and on like it is just shows how little you actually know about proper grammar, which in all honesty, if you have no clue about what is and what isn't the correct kind of sources that a person can use in grammar then you should not be trying to edit anything as you clearly have a lot to learn about writing and should take several English classes before you mess up any more pages on the site!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 07:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how neutral you try to make the argument…it has absolutely no business on the page as it does not meet one single criteria in Wiki’s rules and regulations, nor is it at all relevant to Boxrec! These are links to the Wiki rules about what is and what is not acceptable…Vintagekits, I strongly suggest that you take a long hard look at what is stated therein:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB</a></p>
<p><br />
It does not get any simpler or clearer than the very first paragraph on the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></p>
<p>The first paragraph clearly…very clearly states the following:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed.&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>You comment on the Boxrec page is from a message board argument…there were no articles of any kind, much less being anything reliable!!! What exactly is it that you do not understand about Wiki rules?</p>
<p>Being that Vintagekits continues to ignore Wiki rules and every source that is shown to him by other editors then he and anyone one else that chooses to ignore correct Wiki procedure should probably be blocked from making any kind of edits to the Boxrec page!</p>
<p>After all, the fact of the matter is this, that other than ignoring proper Wiki procedure in posting, Vintagekits and others very clearly are not reliable sources to write about anything pertaining to Boxrec. It would seem that someone who has around seven years of experience with the website would be much, much more reliable to write about the site instead of people who have an obvious agenda and grudge against the very well respected site. Is it not obvious to others that there is an agenda that is incorrectly trying to be pushed here?</p>
<p>Another issue that should be mentioned about the Boxrec page is this…The Boxrec page was normal until Septemeber 30, 2006, which that is the date that Vintagekits chose to add his criticism comments…as can be seen from this history page below…</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boxrec.com&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78689578" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boxrec.com&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78689578" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boxrec.com&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78689578</a></p>
<p>…the page was normal and in a state just as it should be before Vintagekits added his little grudge piece, which again, according to Wiki rules and standards has no business at all on the Boxrec page.</p>
<p>In all honesty, if anything should be added to the page, other than just the original section that appeared before September 30, 2006 describing Boxrec, then it should be edited to look as the Boxrec mediawiki page looks in the link below as that page was written by a long time Boxrec editor who is very familiar with the website and it wasn’t written by someone who not only obviously has a grudge, but also who has very little experience with Boxrec in general other than being just a visitor to the site, which would make the person very, very unreliable to write about the topic, but as I said, the page below is very well done and it describes Boxrec as it should be:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/BoxRec.com" class="external free" title="http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/BoxRec.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/BoxRec.com</a></p>
<p><br />
Editing in data that pertains not to any kind of article, but instead pertaining to an internet message board is completely irrelevant to the Boxrec page and irrelevant to any other Wiki page and as I have stated several times over, before I was blocked for 24 hours, it does not belong on the Boxrec page and needs to be deleted as it does not fit any of Wiki’s Criteria for web content, nor does it meet any of the guidelines put forth in the Wiki links below, which I am again posting in hopes that Vintagekits will actually read them instead of ignoring them due to the fact that they show that he is simply wrong about this issue…though I don’t think it really matters as he likely is not going to recognize the actual rules due to his agenda to post his irrelevant claim and due to the fact that the rules prove him and the others, who made the exact same change in the article, wrong!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB</a></p>
<p><br />
If the Boxrec page is left with the criticism comment, then that would mean that anyone could take any kind of message board debate/argument…about politics, boxing, football, music, or whatever and edit it into a Wiki page and before long the site would be in a complete mess.</p>
<p>Like the page that is being disputed now…if the criticism comment is left then any other Wiki editor could go to the Boxrec internet forum and take any one of the 1000s of other debates and arguments that are going on now, or even debates that took place years ago and the Wiki editor could write a 1000 other irrelevant paragraphs above the criticism comment, in the same manner as the criticism paragraph using debates, or arguments from a message board, but just like the criticism paragraph that is in dispute…it would be completely irrelevant, but that is what would happen if the criticism comment is allowed to remain and it would greatly effect the entire Wiki site as people would be editing pages backing they’re claims with flame wars/debates/arguments from millions of message board forums all over the net and there would be 10s of 1000s of Wiki pages ruined by irrelevant nonsense that does not fit any Wiki criteria and which in no way is at all reliable!</p>
<p>The criticism comment is not from a debate about a reliable article from some respectable source that is being discussed on a message board…it is a arguement that comes directly from an internet message board debate, there are no reliable articles and other than the Wiki links that I posted which describe what is and what is not acceptable, Onorem also makes it very clear as well as he also provides some of the same links that I have to Wiki pages that speak of what is acceptible and what isn’t…yet Vintagekits continues to ignore it! If it does not seem like he has a grudge, then someone describe to me what a grudge is!</p>
<p>Actually, the page probably needs to be edited by someone who is experienced and someone who knows the actual Wiki rules very, very well because as the Duddy-ites continue to demonstart over and over, again and again Vintagekits, Beaumontproject and the others who continued to post the same criticism comment, they not only disregard Wiki’s policy and rules about posting data they are very dead-set with the intent of posting the unreliable nonsense that they continue to edit and as I stated in the beginning…it doesn’t matter how neutral the claim is…according to Wiki rules it has no business whatsoever on the page!!!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 18:24, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ozzwald35 was not banned. He was blocked briefly to try and make sure that he understands how to contribute to Wikipedia articles properly, and can address controversial issues in the appropriate place and manner. This talk page is the appropriate place and manner.</dd>
<dd>The issue that he is bringing up is a legitimate policy question. On first inspection, my opinion is that the whole section is inappropriate for Wikipedia for reasons mentioned repeatedly by others above. It does not appear to be sufficiently important for WP to cover that aspect of the website, and nobody has provided external references for the incident beyond the website itself.</dd>
<dd>Based on existing WP policy I'd be entirely within my rights to just remove it now, with appropriate explanation. I am going to withold any action for at least 24 hrs to allow the talk page discussion to proceed, however. It's possible that its notability and encyclopedic nature are different from my initial impression, and I always prefer to see people who care about an article talk about it and look for consensus. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 18:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unless this statement were to contain links or pointers to other outside parties who had published about the incident, we still haven't established the noteability of this topic. I don't doubt that among some folks who visit Boxrec.com or use its data that this issue is controversial. But so far the controversy appears to be very limited in scope. So limited, in fact, that it's not even worth putting in this encylopedia article. Another self-reference from Boxrec.com probably isn't going to change that. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 16:23, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Duddy website is an external source! As for your POV that it is NN - well I think you are going around blinkered - if it was NN why would there have been such an issue made of it over the past few days including comments on here from the websites owner JohnShep - just because you consider it NN does not mean it is not NN. What is you knowledge and background in boxing anyway?? In my opinion JohnShep, Ozzwald and other should be concentrating on improving the article and showing/highlighting all the topic and beenfits that Boxrec has - then the criticism portion of the article would then be put in context.

<dd>Please understand that to an outsider this is nothing but a silly argument between a few passionate sports fans.

All of this Duddy talk is really ridiculous. I'm one of the top forum posters on the site, and this whole ordeal consisted of one or two threads with a majority of the posts carried out by less than a handful of posters. Obviously, someone has a vendetta to challenge the data of the system at BoxRec or is a really irritable N. Ireland citizen. 99.9% of the people over at boxrec.com care nothing about this issue, and feel these ridiculous individuals should take their pointless arguments somewhere else. If the nationality problem with Duddy's profile is the only one worth recognizing on the site, than its doing a pretty good job considering the amount of information it holds.

<dd>I disagree - this is one of the biggest boxing websites on the net and the owner of the website it treating Irish people like dogs and has called them "a bunch of IRA terrorists" - now that is noteworthy and disgraceful and should be highlighted on the Boxrec page. Now if you want to expand the Boxrec page go ahead - why dont you do that as I believe the nationality issue is only one issue relateing to Boxrec why dont YOU write about the other aspects and achievements of the site. That way it would be more balanced! The funny thing I find is that so many people want to cover up the issue!! That speaks volumes on its own imo. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 20:01, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because <i>you</i> think it's noteable doesn't mean that it belongs in an encyclopedia article. Establish the noteability of the topic just you would any other topic in Wikipedia and I'm sure that we'll be happy to include it. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 20:40, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen VintageKits... I've known the owner of BoxRec to be a prick to Americans as well. He had a filter on the forum that turned the term "American" into something derogatory when it was typed in a forum post. He laughed it off, but it was definitely offensive. Nevertheless, the site is about boxing, not determining nationality. OK, so we have a site owner who is an immature British man.. so what? No one is trying to "cover up" the issue you speak enough, at least from what I know. What I know is that the issue is completely exaggerated and has no place in an encyclopedia article.

<p>That's nothing but nonsense, just like everything else you have been yapping about here. Boxrec has an editor from Ireland and several people from Ireland who post there. The people that John were talking about are the crack-head terrorists that kill children, which most people with sense picked that up right away. You're just upset because you were banned from our forum for doing pretty much the exact same thing you are doing here. Word of advice...nothing you try to say, or do will ever change the rules of grammar and nothing you try to say is going to make your little grudge article stick because it has no feet to stand on!</p>
<p>People here have stated...”if it was such a big controversy then surely there have been several writers that have wrote about it,” but guess what…there are no credible writers that have ever wrote about it and there are no hack writers that have ever written about it either because no one cares about the problem that you have with Boxrec…and as someone else stated…it most certainly was not one of the hot topics on the Boxrec forum…it was a hot topic between you and a couple of your friends, but no one else on the forum cared. In fact, in the six, or seven years that I have been a member of the site, it was one of the more ridiculous and very useless threads that has ever been posted on the forum…and that is saying a lot!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 07:29, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you actually need to count the number of threads that there is and the number of posters on each thread, also you need to look at the other websites that are discussing Boxrecs 1. decision and 2. his attitude in running a site that is attempting to become recognised by the ABC.</p>
<p>Finally, as for more sources – I personally know of two journalists that have been following it and are writing a piece about it. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 08:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well something else that you should be made well aware of according to Wiki rules...an article has to be from a reliable source, so some "fluff piece" written by one of your buddies for some unrecognized website does not count either...LOL...as Wiki rules states...the sources has to be reliable, fair and of a balanced opinion, so an article written by DuddyFreak2006 for website www.duddyfreaks.com most certainly is not considered reliable!</p>
<p>Honestly, the best thing you can do is just move on with your life because you are so wrong in every part of this debate pertaining to Boxrec and Wiki and journalistic rules the world over and to be perfectly honest, other than your buddies, no one else really cares about the issue that you have with Boxrec! Now if you were someone who actually mattered in boxing it might be a different story, but you're not, so live with it and move on before you make yourself look more foolish than you already have!!!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 03:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good to see you are judging the merits of an article before its even written!! If you don't think that Vintagekits has a fair point and argument here then you are the one who is biased. Pretty much every website I have seen lists Duddy as Irish, but maybe they are ALL wrong and Boxrec is right - maybe you should do some reading on why Duddy is and his followers are so vehement that he is listed as Irish - you obviously dont understand any of mordern Irish history and that is why you dont consider it noteworthy - if you had some knowledge in this issue then you would understand why it is important to Irish people - or maybe its possible that like JohnShep - you dont think that the opinions of Irish people matter <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 09:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
As I stated earlier...I don't agree with Duddy not being listed as Irish, but also, as I said earlier, I'm an American and I do not know how the United Kingdom is broken up between Northern and Southern Ireland, but as to it's meaning pertaining to Boxrec on Wiki it is completely irrelevant. The fact that you have got someone to write about it now just demonstrats the agenda, but as I said...an article written by DuddyFan2006 for the website, DuddyFreaks.com, well that is far from a valid source.</p>
<p>Unless there has been a controversy in the boxing community and a controversy that has been written about by respectable, reliable journalists, then it's basically no different than what is on a message board, actually it is no different than using the message board as that will be what the basis of the article is written on and that is no different than using the message board itself...it's just making an even less valid source than the message board as it will be second hand stuff.</p>
<p>I can start up my own website and refute whatever one of your pals is writing, but that would not make it credible either...although I am a credible and respected boxing historian, but some fan site, regardless of who it is is not a valid, creible source and just because you, or one of your pals is now writing an article about the issue on a message board it does not change the fact that it comes from an internet message board...how hard is that to understand? How hard is it to understand that no matter what you try to do that unless it is a controversy that is written about by credible sources then it simply does not meet Wiki standards...it's is just repeating what is said on a message board and it doesn't make it valid. Now if the article that you guys are now writing talks about articles written by several credible sources that say it's a controversy, sources such as The Cyber Boxing Zone, The Sweet Science, Max Boxing, Ring Magazine, or Boxing News, etc. etc..then you would have a case, but one of you writing an article now will not make it valid!</p>
<p>The issue is not a controversy, it never has been a controversy and it never will be a controversy. It's nothing more than a grudge that a couple of fans have and sour grapes that no one else cares.</p>
<p>If Duddy himself petitions that his nationality should be changed then it would certainly hold more weight than htis silly nonsense that you two have been trying to pull and just because you get someone to write about a message board argument it still does not meet up to Wiki's rules and regulations and it never will unless it actually becomes a controversy in the boxing community, but that is as likely as one of you two presenting a valid debate on the topic and if you continue to keep on then I would imagine that there is a possibility that you might be banned as you are doing nothing but causing irrelevant friction on this website, which from what I have read is a big no, no!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 10:36, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. <i>"I don't agree with Duddy not being listed as Irish,"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Right so first off, you do agree that there is an issue here! (I think thats what you are saying - because for someone who constantly brings up the issue of grammar you have just used a double negative! lol)</p>
<p>2. <i>"I'm an American and I do not know how the United Kingdom is broken up between Northern and Southern Ireland,"</i></p>
<p>OK, so now you are admitting that you don't know what you are talking about and have no knowledge of the issue at hand! maybe you should read int the issue and get a full understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>3. <i>"The fact that you have got someone to write about it now just demonstrates the agenda, but as I said...an article written by DuddyFan2006 for the website, DuddyFreaks.com, well that is far from a valid source."</i></p>
<p>I haven't asked anyone to write an article on the issue, and you don't know what company/magazine/newspaper/website this journalist/s works for that are goinging to publish or comment about the issue but already you are criticising the source - also there were a lot more sources than just the Boxrec board that were sourced within the article - it was kind of you to just ignore them all to suit your POV.</p>
<p>4 <i>"How hard is it to understand that no matter what you try to do that unless it is a controversy that is written about by credible sources then it simply does not meet Wiki standards"</i></p>
<p>It is not for you to judge with is and what is not a credible source! What is controversial to one person may not be to others - I know plenty of issue that I do not care about that other people consider of the upmost importance.</p>
<p>5. <i>"The Cyber Boxing Zone, The Sweet Science, Max Boxing, Ring Magazine, or Boxing News, etc. etc..then you would have a case, but one of you writing an article now will not make it valid!"</i></p>
<p>Again you have replied to a number of messages on this and you don't even know what the source would be - that says to me that you will never accept any source that does not support your POV.</p>
<p>6. <i>"The issue is not a controversy, it never has been a controversy and it never will be a controversy. It's nothing more than a grudge that a couple of fans have and sour grapes that no one else cares."</i></p>
<p>On what basis are you making this statement - what mandate do you have - you are now going against what you already said! the very fact that you are writing about it shows that it is a controversial issue - and this same issue causes controversy on Boxrec day in day out - see the debates on Abraham, Maskaev, Baki, Kostya etc etc etc. Also if you do not think it is controversial try reading about Barry McGuigans experiences and you will know that this is a serious issue and it has followed McGuigan around all his life.</p>
<p>7. <i>"If Duddy himself petitions that his nationality should be changed then it would certainly hold more weight"</i></p>
<p>He has - a statement was issued through Camp Duddy, Johns management team! - JohnShep (the owner of the websites) basically said the "he was not going to change his nationality back to Irish to keep a bunch of IRA terrorists happy" - that statement on its own is enough to shows the issues notoriety and how controversial the issue is!</p>
<p>8. <i>"this silly nonsense that you two have been trying to pull and just because you get someone to write about a message board argument it still does not meet up to Wiki's rules and regulations and it never will unless it actually becomes a controversy in the boxing community,"</i></p>
<p>There are a lot more people interested in this issue than just two people - you keep talking like you speak for the rest of the world - you dont you there are as many people on wiki who consider that the nationality section of the article should stay in. You might think its nonsense and that just show how little you know about the subject. It might not be a major controversy within the boxing community at large (I never said it was) but this article is not about the whole boxing community, its about Boxrec - and it is noteworthy when discussing Boxrec. I am not say that is the main issue and item of noteworthiness on Boxrec, its not, its just one issue - but its the issue I have chosen to write about - other people can write about the other aspects of Boxrec and then it would be seen in its proper context - as just one thing that goes on on Boxrec - I would advise that you make the Boxrec article better and improve its content rather than just try and keep this issue out of the article.</p>
<p>Every Wiki entry you have made is about Boxrec - however not one entry has been to improve, extend or add substance to the article - that speaks volumes!</p>
<p>9. <i>"if you continue to keep on then I would imagine that there is a possibility that you might be banned as you are doing nothing but causing irrelevant friction on this website, which from what I have read is a big no, no!!"</i></p>
<p>Thats a laugh, again, I will point out that you are the only one here that has had his account suspended! Secondly I have added to a number of articles not just Boxrec - I try to be constructive, have you even attempted to come to a compromise about the article? - try it! <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 13:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Give it up already…you’re just ranting complete nonsense now and frankly just making yourself look like an idiot who not only knows nothing about the rules of how to write, but also someone who does not seem to have the ability to learn how to write after being told time after time after time about what is correct and what isn’t!</p>
<p>And as far as me sitting here wasting my time arguing this complete nonsense with you, I’m simply not going to do it. I have way more important things to do with my time than sit here and continue this little flame war with you arguing some nonsense about something that I am already right about. It’s now pretty much an open and shut case. I’m just glad that I was right in the matter according to Wiki rules, regulations and criteria and that the page correctly no longer has the irrelevant grudge claim!--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 13:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
