<p>correction, i said this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rocky_Marciano&amp;diff=84761896&amp;oldid=84760741" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rocky_Marciano&amp;diff=84761896&amp;oldid=84760741" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rocky_Marciano&amp;diff=84761896&amp;oldid=84760741</a> This was most correct version, this idiot today reverted everything under umbrella of POV, which is not, go there and see what can be done to be reverted to this version. Everything has been deleted, the bio looks pathetic now, also, do you know any good sports administrators, so we can return to correct version? Today Nov 1st the page has been terribly vandalized. They do not know any history. Oct 30th last version was fine and the version that was there was there for over a year, go there and reverse, the guy who did this should be banned, ke killed lots of important information., take care. Also a link to Nino Valdez boxing record is missing. As far as 50th bout goes, nobody claimed for sure, but there are people who claim it, anyways, it'g good you put it in parenthesis, as a possibility, like it was.</p>
<p>Ok, I will look into that site soon. I think you may have a point. <b>-BoxingWear</b></p>
<p>Well it seems they improved the site but it's still not 100%. <b>-Ananymous</b></p>
<p>Can I give your name, signt your posts pal. I will see what I can do about the link above, seems there are few things missing.<b>-BoxingWear</b> <a name="Boxing_bios" id="Boxing_bios"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boxing bios</span></h2>
<p>How you doing? Can you change few bios, there are so many idiots here, not to mention many administrators who do not even know how to count, and there are certain things which need changing, i understand you know a lot about fight game.-Nov 20</p>
<p>I need your assistance... Marciano page is ok, but messed up, many good things are missing, about 85-0 comparison, to Robinson, other fighters, read my post above, see what you can do, i understand you know a great deal on boxing, i know who you are, somebody told me me about you, so hopefully you can fix this, best wishes and happy turkey.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I noticed you added a case to the article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_brutality.html" title="Police brutality">police brutality</a>, which I removed and you then reverted. I removed the case because it was not discussed on the talk page. Past discussions have set criteria for cases appearing on the list, and currently there is discussion there as to what cases belong in the article. I welcome your input on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolice_brutality_f290.html" title="Talk:Police brutality">talk page</a>. I am reverting your addition again pending the discussion there. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo</a><a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green">100</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 01:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry I missed your response here; I did not intend to ignore you. What there is to discuss is that there is already an agreement about what to add to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_brutality.html" title="Police brutality">police brutality</a>. It's not set in stone, and if you want to change it you must first propose your change there!

<p>This guy keeps on inverting info about rocky, as one of the greatest, i never said he was, i said something else, also included 2 links with interviews, see that word stays here, again nobody is greatest, impossible to say. Different time eras. But perfect record speaks for itself, he beat the best of his times.</p>
<p>Hello 64, how can I help you exactly?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greatest fighters, lineal champs</span></h2>
<p>Why is this missing, did we vote for it, why are these people doing this?Last time I checked it was more pro than con. I think that was a good article, do you ever care, i mean, do something more.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the lineal champs thing. What do you want to do?</p>
<p>Also, why do you continue to revert my changes? The changes I made to the Marciano page significantly improved the way the article read. They consolidated paragraphs, removed information that did not belong in paragraphs, etc. I'm not trying to undo your work. I am trying to make these articles much easier to read as well as remove weasel words and other things. It seems you just go through and revert everything I do because of some personal vendettta. I'm all for finding common ground, but the information here has to meet Wikipedia standards. Some of the things you write does not meet those standards. Also, some of the things you write are very poorly written. We can keep the content, but the grammar, punctuation, syntax, etc., needs to be improved. That's what I'm doing, but then you revert. MKil 19:07, 19 January 2007 (UTC)MKil</p>
<p>Not so, not at all, you keep on insisting and playing same old game, every time I do something, I do it right and explain the situation, you have some personal vandetta, and vandetta is not spelled with 3 t's. No, I am making them much to read, you are simply complicating everything. This is enough. All has been explained, you keep on repeating yourself and not answering proper questions. It's all well known and you even contradict that. <strong class="selflink">User_talk: BoxingWear</strong></p>
<p>Look, you can't write very well. I am attempting to clean up your writing and make these articles better. You provide no reason for your reverts except some dislike of me. Let's work together to try and include the information you want but also have it presented in a readable way. If you think I'm removing relevant material, then point that out. If you are simply upset because I change your poor writing or remove your usage of weasel words (I posted the policy on the Baker page, you may want to read up on it), then you have no room for complaint. MKil 19:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)MKil</p>
<p>Again and again, all was pointed out, you are simply playing games here. Also first you say i write bad, then you say I do not., Now when you are wrong on few things, you slowly change language.</p>
<p>No, I've always contended that your writing is bad. The articles you write are hard to read and include a variety of grammar and syntax problems. Let's talk about trying to find common ground. MKil 19:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)MKil</p>
<p>Do not leave me any messages, I will delete them, you are changing story, I will not allow this to go on. -Boxingwear Baker article, you kill all the information, not only few words, take away days and important information, I WILL NEVER ALLOW THIS TO STAND. This is vandalism now. -Boxingwear</p>
<p>You might want to read what lmcelhiney wrote on his/her page: "OK, BoxingWear and MKil, You folks need to work together to resolve this, please. The Talk page is longer than the article! Here are two examples which are similar to this article: Tony Gale and Marcel Cerdan. Note, that both are basically a blob of text on the page without citations. Now, look at Rocky Graziano, Al Hostak, and Sugar Ray Robinson for example which have been WikiFied. Note the use of an introduction and sections which pull together common information. Do not use weasel words, your invention, that has been explained., I am not using any caps, except to point out your private agenda. -Boxingwear</p>
<p>Why are you getting so agitated? Weasel words is a wikipedia term that is well-known. You might want to go and read the style manual. It does not seem you are well-acquainted with it. If you look rationally at my changes, you will see they are well-written and improve the flow of the article. Your revisions merely degrade the quality of the article. Again, if I am removing legitimate information, please point it out. I am willing to work with you on this and other topics of common concern (lineal champs page, for instance). My goal is for accurate and well-written Wikipedia articles on boxing. Why do you thwart movement in this direction?

<dd><small>That is 100% not true, I am simply putting correct information, also Mkil had lots of problems with other users in the past. I simply want article to look good, i am not doing anything wrong, this man demands self evident truth, something that already exists in the world he wants evidence, he had problems with calling rocky greatest, as some people consider him, i gave links, he reverted, I would like this user no longer to bother others, sure, he can reply well and may be he means well, but he is not doing it right, so even if he means well, eventually problems arise, I was asked by others as well to look into his problems.

<p><small>Every time I try to fix something, he keeps on inverting his own story, on the Baker talk page, I truly explained myself, on rocky marciano page, others tried to explain. He simply does not listen, will not listen,then when he gives an argument, he writes a whole book, repeats himself and adds stuff totally irrelevant to the situation, tries to revert the given, something already well, well known.<strong class="selflink">User_talk: BoxingWear</strong></small></p>

<dd><small>OK, BoxingWear and MKil, You folks need to work together to resolve this, please. The Talk page is longer than the article! Here are two examples which are similar to this article: <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Gale_fc71.html" title="Tony Gale">Tony Gale</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Cerdan_1c4f.html" title="Marcel Cerdan">Marcel Cerdan</a>. Note, that both are basically a blob of text on the page without citations. Now, look at <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Graziano_7c8b.html" title="Rocky Graziano">Rocky Graziano</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Hostak_3bab.html" title="Al Hostak">Al Hostak</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_Ray_Robinson_21cd.html" title="Sugar Ray Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a> for example which have been WikiFied.

<dd><small>Use WikiPedia (as I did to find these articles) and Google to find other sources of information and cite your sources. (That doesn't mean just putting an external reference at the bottom or having WikiLinks within the article.) Then, once you have the facts and all agree on them, you can write the article and have minor disagreements over the way something is said. Right now, there is so little material there and so many weasel words (many, some, about, etc.) that the article has no chance of being retained over time. The guidelines here give you lots of information about what an article should look like and how to use and cite sources.</small></dd>

<p><small>I tried and tried and tried to reason with this man, not only that he is taking away important information on Baker, he is doing the same with Rocky, if you go on my talk page, it has been explained, other users complained, so, try to block that guy, he is killing very important informtion, e.g. Chuvalo fight, date sep 9, keeps on reverting, i mean, he is hopeless, this is now vandalism, he has his own agenda, and other users reported that problem to me. He should not be allowed on wiki, he creates problems. Besides I was a pro boxer, I know a little bit more. The problem is, he keeps on putting words into my mouth. Another point, on marciano page, he reverted my edit abour rocky's military service, i deleted united kingdom reference, since he did not provide evidence of that, this is not a self given, we need to know that for sure, he needs to provide sources, i wanted to add myself he delivered ammunition to soldiers in France, but I have no link to prove it. <strong class="selflink">User_talk: BoxingWear</strong> All I ask is that my edits and BoxingWear's edits be compared and judged on their merits. Mine are better written and avoid the use of weasel words. This disagreement is becoming quite childish, I'll admit. It's unfortunate that it has to reach the level where we are drawing the attention of others. MKil 19:59, 19 January 2007 (UTC)MKil</small></p>

<p><small>Folks, no one is going to compare your edits and judge them on their merits until you simply stop changing them and allow people to read them! You'll never be able to create this article if each of you have such ownership of the text. But, please understand, THAT is not the problem with this article. Your reverts will cause the article to be protected or the editors blocked or banned.</small></p>

In it, it states, "Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: Do not simply revert changes in a dispute. When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, improve the edit, rather than reverting it. Provide a good edit summary when making significant changes that other users might object to." When you make changes, I do not automatically delete them. I try to improve your writing. That is what I did today. You added some info on Patterson and then when I tried to improve it, you automatically reverted it. That is a violation of Wikipedia policy.

<p>Nice message, no direct attacks. Ok, but basically I do not want mkil to screw with marciano page once it gets unblocked, sure he is civil, but so are many criminals out there, con-artists and so on, by ye results you shall be judged, not civility or empty talk. Now, how to archive things, upload photos, create rectangular colorful box like you have, get music, change one article into anotheer, assuming the name is wrong. Also I have a feeling some people have been logging off their user name and going to other computer, do administrators have power to track that?I know blocked users can not log on, evenif they are in good standings, hmm... i think many walk away from wiki because of that, no wonder, not to mention long arguments...as they should be walking away, i heard some stories...ignorance is the key!

<p>No, I am not accusing 64, just asking, but 58, yea, i would like investigation into this... Yea, good to know you protect it. I am suspectig mkil of being user 58.8 and possibly 64. I did what I could and according to best boxing knowledge. I will be glad to resolve problem, but mkil is the problem, i am not blaming anybody else, i mean, well, look on my talk page...Thanx for calling me good editor.-Boxingwear <a name="Other_things" id="Other_things"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other things</span></h2>
<p>It's not easy just talking about this problem, but I have other things I need to fix, first... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Mediation_Cabal#Lineal_Heavyweight_boxing_champions" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Mediation_Cabal#Lineal_Heavyweight_boxing_champions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Mediation_Cabal#Lineal_Heavyweight_boxing_champions</a></p>
<p>Then, how to create music on my page, move to archives, add a rectanle so my conversation appears in it, how to create archives, i asked this quries other users and of course, nothing. Reply on my talk page, i will be busy these days, but do what i suggest on rocky. I may not (fully)reply for few days. Also, greatest ever, still not resolved, computer fight means nothing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rocky_Marciano#Greatest_problem.2C_not_resolved.2C_people_who_participated_in_the_poll_do_not_know_boxing" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rocky_Marciano#Greatest_problem.2C_not_resolved.2C_people_who_participated_in_the_poll_do_not_know_boxing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rocky_Marciano#Greatest_problem.2C_not_resolved.2C_people_who_participated_in_the_poll_do_not_know_boxing</a></p>
<p>Arguments will not stop with mkil, i will no longer reply there (except now and then), I will leave you some messages instead, mkil is using every single word i say to my advantage, here, american biographers wrote on rocky, as the greatest, if not, greatest puncher ever... <a href="http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=rockymarciano" class="external free" title="http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=rockymarciano" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=rockymarciano</a> so yea, SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER HIM AS THE GREATEST, must be there. I am not going to search for more links, agian, i explained, it's a given. It belongs, it's part of reality. So, there you go, correct the article the way I requested and tell mkil never to touch rocky site again. Only people like mkil need evidence for something that is already given and proven thru time. As Barnum said, there are fools born every second... Obviously, now we know why courts give statutes of limitations...

<p>BoxingWear, I've got to be honest here - I'm seeing some fairly civil and solid proposals from mkil and PTO, and I'm seeing several strong accusations and borderline personal attacks from your end. Again, <i>focus on the discussion of the content of the article and stop accusing others of vandalism</i>. I'm not seeing anything even close to vandalism in the edit log; so please drop that. If you continue to insult the other editors and disrupt the discussion on the article's talk page, you will be blocked for a short period to cool down. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 23:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will do my best not to rant or anything as a matter of fact i have recently agreed on few things, i am not a sock poppet, i did leave messages for other administrators because of all these ranting and edit wars i may get into trouble, check my history and contribution, i did what was best and had no intention to cause problems but nobody listens here. I am the one who checked and requested for ip user check against another use. Why would I get into trouble, just because somebody you think is suck poppet left me a message, also, i could easily create another user id from different ip and nobody will know, this is my ONLY account! Honestly, when I asked for assistance, there was no assistance, so what am I supposed to do? It is not my fault some administrators think otherwise or think i am somebody else. Boxingwear</p>

<p>Hi, you replied on meditation, is that something new, i thought i should post on administrator noticeboard? I want to recreate that article, was deleted for no reason, will need your assistance, also i need a good wikipedian to look after my edits. Boxingwear <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by BoxingWear (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BoxingWear_877d.html" title="Special:Contributions/BoxingWear">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello there Boxingwear: I regret I am unclear as to what exactly what you are asking me, although I will attempt to respond to what I think you meant.</dd>
<dd>In response to your first point, mediation has been around on Wikipedia for a long time - it is far from new - but the purpose of mediation is quite different from that of the Administrator's Noticeboard (<a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>). The Administrator's Noticeboard is to post messages about issues requiring the attention of Wikipedia administrators; the purpose of mediation is to provide a neutral assistance in solving disputes between multiple third-parties. From what you describe above it doesn't sound like either is appropriate to your scenario.</dd>
<dd>I am assuming that you dispute the deletion of an article and you want it to be restored. In which case, you will need to post your request at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_undeletion_17bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion">Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion</a>, and if the article was deleted by standard process you may wish to consider whether it falls within Wikipedia's encyclopaedic scope.</dd>
<dd>As for "looking after" your edits, do you mean "looking over" as in you would like me to advise you on how you could improve your editing? If so, I would be more than willing to do so; but if you mean "looking after" as in protecting them from being removed, I regret that I cannot do so.</dd>
<dd>I hope the above was at least in some way an answer to your question - if it was not, please feel free to elaborate, and I may be able to answer you better. I wish you all the best of success on Wikipedia. Yours, --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 00:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I accidentally replied to the above at User_talk:Boxingwear rather than <strong class="selflink">User_talk:BoxingWear</strong>, due to the way you name yourself in your edits. Now I've found the right page, I note the above. I suspect my response will probably not be much good, then. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 20:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
