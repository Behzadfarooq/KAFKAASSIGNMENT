<p>Box Hill Institute is the descendant of two Box Hill area technical schools.</p>
<p>"Box Hill Technical School for Girls and Women" was opened on the 4th September 1924, having welcomed sixty-five Junior pupils some six months before. The girls studied subjects like housewifery, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookery.html" title="Cookery">cookery</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millinery.html" title="Millinery">millinery</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressmaking.html" title="Dressmaking">dressmaking</a>. Some girls also took more vocational courses like <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">accounting</a> and secretarial work.</p>
<p>On the 2nd February 1943 the "Box Hill Technical School for Boys" was established because many boys in the eastern suburbs were being turned away from <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swinburne_University_of_Technology_3ab8.html" title="Swinburne University of Technology">Swinburne Technical School</a>. They studied subjects like sheetmetal work, <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technical_drawing.html" title="Technical drawing">technical drawing</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpentry.html" title="Carpentry">carpentry</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s both technical schools added post-secondary options like certificates in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_studies.html" title="Business studies">business studies</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. The Girl's Technical School started the first business certificate course in 1967.</p>
<p>The Girls' Technical School was renamed "Whitehorse Technical School" in 1971. Around this time the Boy's Technical School separated its tertiary technical offerings from the secondary ones, the tertiary section becoming "Box Hill Technical School". Both schools were declared colleges of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technical_and_Further_Education_cfac.html" title="Technical and Further Education">Technical and Further Education</a> in late 1981.</p>
<p>On the 25th of January 1984, Whitehorse Technical School and Box Hill Technical School merged to become "Box Hill College of TAFE". The College was renamed "Box Hill Institute" ten years later.</p>
