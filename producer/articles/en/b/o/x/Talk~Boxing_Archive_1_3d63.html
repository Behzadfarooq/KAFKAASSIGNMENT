<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poor Structure</span></h2>
<p>Wow, huge article but poor on structure, and sometimes inconsistent. This is not my area of expertise, but I have some suggestions nonetheless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amateur boxing is often called olympic boxing by practicioners, since in modern usage, "amateur" carries connotations of low skill.</li>
<li>The noblemen who used fist-fights as a form of duelling can be seen as inspiration for the amateur boxing tradition, as opposed to the prize fights which were the origins of professional boxing. Actually, the differences between the two styles are so big it might be worth separating them into different articles.</li>
<li>Damages and controvercies should be separated under a heading of its own. A factoid that may be interesting is that professional boxing is illegal in many countries, because of the prevalence of 'chronic concussion' and the long-term effects of boxing. Other things that should be mentioned is "punch-drunk syndrome", and that all knockouts are in fact severe concussions.</li>
<li>head protectors give some protection against cuts, but relatively little against concussion, since wrapping an egg in cotton won't protect the yolk if you give it a shake, so to say.</li>
<li>The protective nature of gloves, and that different types are used in olympic vs. professional. I've read that the introduction of gloves into pugilism actually brutalized the sport because participants could now strike to the head with less risk of hand injury. If this can be verified it might be worth a mention.</li>
<li>In olympic boxing, 1 - 4 % of all fights end in knockouts, according to an article by McCunney &amp; Russo, 1984. I don't have verified numbers for professional boxing, but I've read that it's about one third. (People who watch boxing could perhaps verify or refute this figure). Bear in mind that knockouts are defined rather differently in the two sports, although we are probably still talking about concussion even in O.B.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed the British view of boxing</span></h2>
<p>Well I was shocked to read the sub heading on personalities. It was nothing but a British view. Some Northern Irish guy and a Scottish fellow and English chaps winning in some obscure fights are mentioned like they were the "Rumble in the Jungle". And there was no mention of Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson. There was only a passing reference to Mohd. Ali which says "Other countries have their fighters too" and talks in just one paragraph about him and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>naturally being the wikipedian i've i changed it to better reflect the actual world. this isnt' the British encycopedia on British boxing. I wonder how it's been missed by many people. Or is it that many reading encyclopedias don't read articles on boxing. it was glaringly obvious that the previous versions were basically saying that Britain was and si the only place boxing is going on. ridiculous. Anyway, it's done and dusted.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some NPOV issues under "Personalities" (e.g., the Tyson paragraph). This is Wikipedia, not an pay-per-view ad. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Carson_2138.html" title="User:Erik Carson">blahpers</a> 02:15, 2005 May 3 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually there was a HUMUNGOUS bias towards the British boxers before I edited it, and the POV of the entire article needs a little toning down since its obvious the previous version was culled from a book on british boxing. Well I've tried to improve the NPOV in personalities a bit. Generally you give a bit more time to the latest fighters, especially if that person happens to really be one of the all time nasty figures in boxing. Mike Tyson has done all criminal/illegal acts like rape, assault and battery, biting an opponent's ear, talking the trashiest pre box talk ever, being jailed twice, barred from boxing, earning the highest paycheck and going bankrupt to conversion to islam. All this while he was rated in a survey as the one possessing the deadliest right hand punch of the century while being one of the shortest contemporary boxers. I suppose some personalities hog a little more sentences that others. Maybe the tone could be different without losing his "acts". Someone can do a better job here, please do so. That's the spirit of Wikipedia.&#160;:)--<a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 05:50, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Injuries</span></h2>
<p>Like pointed out back in October by Vinterman this article lacks any information about the injuries often sustained in professional boxing. Can anyone make a brief summary of what the most common injuries are, how they're handled and what impact it's had on the sport? It's about the only thing missing from this article at the moment.</p>

<p>I have put the cleanup flag since the personalities sections appears twice, and there is some repetition of content. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 02:21, 2005 July 29 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Impact of Boxing on the English Language"</span></h2>
<p>I don't think "Going down swinging" is from boxing, but rather from baseball as the batter can "go down swinging" or "get caught looking" at the ball. Meaning he strikes out swinging or strikes out looking at a strike but thinking it's a ball. In boxing if you're going down you're typically not swinging, it's the other guy doing the swinging at your head and that's why you're going down.</p>
<p>"ring down the curtain" - a boxing phrase&#160;? I've heard 'bring down the curtain' - an obvious theatrical phrase for the end of a performance.</p>
<p>The OED supports this by defining an entry for dropping/falling cutains maning the ending of a performance or action.</p>
<p>Because of this I'm deleting the wiki entry for 'ring down the curtain' as I believe it is a corruption of 'bring down the curtain' and not a boxing term</p>
<p>"down for the count" - the OED defines this as being defeated, so I'll amend the entry in the entry in this section to reflect this</p>
<p><br />
Do you think "show you the ropes" is derived from boxing? Someone teaching you a technique is said to be showing you the ropes. Perhaps that's a boating term, but ropes on boats are called "lines" so that leaves me thinking it's from boxing.</p>
<p><a name="Boxing_Gloves" id="Boxing_Gloves"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boxing Gloves</span></h2>
<p><i>These gloves' purpose is to protect the knuckles.</i></p>
<p>The stated purpose of boxing gloves is to protect the fighters' knuckles, but in various competitions the padding requirements vary wildly. The ~8oz. open-fingered gloves used in <a href="../../../u/f/c/UFC_e9e8.html" title="UFC">UFC</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pride.html" title="Pride">Pride</a> are very lightly padded, whereas boxing and <a href="../../../k/-/1/K-1.html" title="K-1">K-1</a> use heavily padded gloves. I haven't heard of many more knuckle injuries in MMA than in boxing -- and it seems a lot easier to achieve a knockout in UFC or Pride than in K-1 or boxing. Mightn't the "gloves of fair size" rule actually exist foremost to protect the opponent from easy KO (and thereby force some extra strategy above and beyond brute force) rather than to (just) protect the fighter's knuckles?</p>
<p><i>The boxers wore "mufflers" (padded gloves)</i></p>
<p>The fact that gloves were previously called mufflers (muffle means to stifle or repress) pretty much supports this.</p>
<p><a name="Gloves_Don.27t_Diminish_.23_of_KOs" id="Gloves_Don.27t_Diminish_.23_of_KOs"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gloves Don't Diminish # of KOs</span></h2>
<p>The fact is, boxing gloves, especially the small professional 8 or 10 gloves, make it easier to hit harder. Oates discusses this in 'On Boxing' and Anasi in 'The Gloves.' One of the main reasons the fights could go on for so long in the bare-knuckle days is that fighters couldn't hit with full strength without breaking their hands. A simple experiment: Try punching a wall with ten ounce gloves, then try doing it with your fist alone. Guess which hurts your hand more. The note in the gloves section connects to an article that makes no comment on gloves preventing KOs.<a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumblio_9506.html" title="User:Mumblio">Mumblio</a> 04:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An idea</span></h2>
<p>If you look at a film's page (take <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfinger.html" title="Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a> for example) you will see at the end that it contains the text <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/" rel="nofollow">Goldfinger (1964)</a> at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a></i>,.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">1867? I'm being pedantic. but ...</span></h2>
<p>"'Boxing' as distinct from any other form of fist fighting can be dated from 1867, when John Chambers drafted new rules."</p>
<p>Codified rules of boxing aside, people were referring to organised fist-fights (formal or infomal) before then. Consider "Tom Brown's Schooldays" by Thomas Hughes, Chapter 5, published in 1857:</p>
<p>" Learn to box then, as you learn to play cricket and football. Not one of you will be the worse, but very much the better for learning to box well."</p>
<p>The chapter describes a fight between Tom Brown and "Slogger" Williams, both attended by seconds. Tom's second, Harry East, is armed with a wet sponge to refresh Tom in between rounds. Although there is a discussion about whether wrestling throws are legal, the fight sounds very much like an organised boxing match, with references to a "timekeeper" and a "ring", suggesting that there was some notion of boxing as a codified sport or martial art, or at the very least, that there was some sporting basis to what is, in essence, a playground scrap.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boxing Historian as a Hobby</span></h2>
<p>I am a writing teacher at a small university in Northern MN as well as an Boxing History Hobbiest. I think that this article has a great amount of information to start, but there is barely any structure aside from the headings. I think it would be fun to totally overhaul this article, beginning at the ground and working my way up. I'll take into account all the things that have been mentioned here, including some of the information that I have uncovered in my own readings about the sport and see what happens. This is only a fraction of the work that I intend to do with this article and others in this wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm no expert but a boxing enthusiast with a masochistic streak for textual accuracy. I will edit this article in bits starting with its structure and basic facts like history and techniques. So that our work does not interfere, let's keep the communication alive. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarkovsky_615a.html" title="User:Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to allow someone else, such as this writing teacher to rework the article. There is some basic information worth saving but it is not very scholarly. As a USA Boxing coach I also want to add that some of the sections are not really accurate such as styles, which seems quite redundant ie.listing swarmers,brawlers, and infighters which in reality are all the same thing but with slight variations, Mickey Ward being an example, as well as Arturo Gatti. The skill, natural talent and versatility of the fighter is the decisive factor. Most coaches train for a variety of conditions. But at any rate this is a noble first run but should be rewritten toward a more academic bent. JWPhilo</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time Periods - History of the Legends</span></h2>
<p>I have added time periods to the Boxing Legends section (previously Great Personalities of Boxing) in single decade intervals. My hope is that the 'Legends of British Boxing' section as well as the legends from other parts of the world will be absorbed into this section. That way, we can view boxing personalities in terms of their place in boxing history rather than belonging to the British history of boxing or the American one, etc. What do you think?</p>

<p><a name="Techniques" id="Techniques"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Techniques</span></h2>
<p>Boxing coaches train a wide variety of different ways to throw a punch or stop a punch, so the techniques section will be extremely varied. I understand this problem, but there are absolutely incorrect bits of info that I have found in the techniques section. For example, it is not entirely correct to say that the jab "does not leave the boxer open to attack." It is easily counterable with a slip and a jab or a slip and a lead hook. I wonder how many people contributing to the article actually have boxed? How many know the sport from just watching it? I would like to get a conversation going with people who regularly practice the sport so that we can really clean up the techniques + regulations. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoneheadmx_bd57.html" title="User:Boneheadmx">Boneheadmx</a> 13:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am a boxer. "Open" here refers to the exposure of the body the moment a punch is thrown. What I meant was: you do not need to lower your defenses to throw a jab, not that a jab negates counter-punching. Even so, the evasive examples you describe (slip &amp; jab, lead hook) involve moving around the jab ie. there are no 'holes' readily available to exploit in the static structure of the jab itself (roughly speaking). This is unlike the cross which bobs your head forward and exposes the right flank or the hook which tends to opens the torso. Anyone who has boxed before will feel structurally vulnerable on those last two punches I described; the jab is a far 'safer' punch in terms of body alignment , commitment, weight distribution and positioning. Saying that the jab "does not leave the boxer open to attack" is not entirely correct in the wholistic fighting context of the sport but I am not discussing the complete strategic consequences of techniques in this section, simply describing the punches in terms of their structure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is the cross the biggest knockout punch?</span></h2>
<p>'The cross is the most powerful punch and is responsible for the majority of knockouts'</p>
<p>My trainer insists that it is in fact the hook that claims the most knockouts. What's everyone else's opinion on this? <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarkovsky_615a.html" title="User:Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a></p>

<dd>Yeah, it seems to be hooks, at least for me. I've gotten my share of getting hit in the chin with all sorts of punches, but what really hurts is the hook. I've almost been knocked out in sparring by an uppercut, but that was my fault since I was tired, had my chin up and mouth open. I guess it depends. Some coaches seem to teach left hooks and right crosses only, stating that a right cross is kind of like a faster hook because of the rotation of the lower body and that right hooks are a bit slow. I've always learned to do body combos with left hooks and right crosses, for example. So I guess in that context, a right cross is like a hook anyway. For the article, I think it would be best to omit that bit for right now since we have no evidence other than anecdotal to support the claim that crosses cause the most KOs. I personally would agree with hooks/uppercuts, but I think I'm just going to take out that sentence. By the way, thanks for cleaning up the techniques section, Tarkovsky. Things are looking way better.</dd>
<dd>PS: Perhaps we can talk about the possible reasons why there is a higher rate of KOs in pro boxing? 10 rounds or so is really tough, and it is clear by even watching the fighters that they get tired. Tiredness = lowering the guard and/or panting (not biting down on the mouthpiece) and/or not tucking the chin in, which = a higher chance of getting a concussion.</dd>
<dd>PPS: I was thinking also that someone should take some pictures of boxers throwing some clean punches as examples for the techniques.</dd>

<p>Thanks mate, just doing my bit! I think another factor for the higher KO rate in Professional boxing is that they wear lighter gloves. The heavier gloves of Amateur boxing slow the punches down and make hard, KO-worthy hits difficult to achieve. It is more economical, under these conditions, to conserve energy for winning points. So an Amateur game plan is structured around winning points under equipment restrictions while the Professional fighter goes for the KO. That's my take on it.</p>
<p>As for the hook, I was at a bar watching a feature called "100 Greatest Knockouts of All Time" and to my amazement, 90% of the KOs were from body shots, rips to the stomach. My explanation is: while the head is a prized target, it is encased in bone. The stomach, however, has no such protection. Also, the hook and the uppercut approach from outside the eye's main field of vision which might make it harder to detect.</p>
<p>Yeah, pictures for the punches would be great, perhaps someone could work on this.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarkovsky_615a.html" title="User:Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a></p>
<p>I believe some of the reasons for the higher knockout rate in professional versus amateur is 1. the maturity of the boxer, both physically and mentally; 2. the head gear and gloves; 3. the duration of the bout, there is just not enough time to cause the damage needed; 4. the lower ranks of pro fighting are not as good technically as amateurs both offensively and defensively, at least this is my observation as a coach.JWPhilo</p>
<p>The strongest punch differs from person to person. With Tyson it was the uppercuts, Cooney the left hooks, Hearns the right hand. Its the way the person throws it also has a factor. Its not like a weak cross cannot rival a devastating uppercut. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaya_Levy_06c6.html" title="User:Maya Levy">Maya Levy</a> 13:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>RE: HOOKS I was always of the opinion that the old boxing maxim, 'It's the one that you don't see that hurts you' was silly. However...As a southpaw the power punch that hit me the most was the right cross or straight right hand. I almost never got hit with hooks, mostly because it's easy for a southpaw to tuck his chin and take hooks on the shoulder. Yet the few hooks that did catch me flush were easily the most devastating and memorable I felt. I think this is in large part due to the fact that I never saw those hooks and wasn't able to roll with them; out of nowhere, the side of my head would explode. These hooks were thrown from close range and actually spent most of their trajectory outside my peripheral vision. I think that's the reason why the hook is such a devastating KO punch - even though it's not thrown in most cases with a fighter's dominant hand.<a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumblio_9506.html" title="User:Mumblio">Mumblio</a> 03:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photos of Boxing</span></h2>
<p>Boxing has a rich photographic history from the past century and there are so many photos floating around on the internet; it would be shame if they went to waste. I am currently trawling around for photos to put into the article (properly referenced of course), preferably high-quality, artfully-framed shots that portray the unique, brutal character of the sport. I'm avoiding too many photos which show boxers from the same country or photos which show a boxer dominating or badly pummelling the other (for NPOV purposes).</p>
<p>Well, this should be real fun&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarkovsky_615a.html" title="User:Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a></p>
<p>Ok, there are now seven photos in the article. I have tried very hard not to over-present American boxers and have included other nationalities: Britain, Cuba, Australia, Jamaica, Phillippines, Mexico, Thailand. All photos are fairly recent (past two years) and, hopefully, do the sport justice.</p>
<p>I chose Louis vs Marciano 1951 as the header photograph because of the legendary status of both boxers and the smouldering, contrasting nature of the shot which captures boxing perfectly.</p>

<p>Should the red herring really be in this section. I don't think anyone seriously claims boxing causes lots of deaths. Boxing causes lots of brain injury, which in turn causes mental retardation and other problems. Look at Riddick Bowe, or more importantly listen to him. He talks so slowly and slurred. So many older boxers are like this. I think the medical community is more concerned with these destructive aspects, the permanent damage caused, not the fact that the boxers are causing pain upon each other. (Though I am sure some people have problems with that as well) The whole section comes off rather slanted to me. If the red herring has to stay, it certainly shouldn't be first, that kind of biases things to have a red herring counter claim before the actual claim (<a href="../../../c/_/h/User%7EC_h_fleming_140c.html" title="User:C h fleming">CHF</a> 09:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punches</span></h2>
<p>I have to take issue with the section on punches. The section on hooks says "From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (knuckles pointing forward) and the elbow bent." I don't accept this as the elbow is not really "drawn back". A right hook can be thrown from the guard position without the elbow being "drawn back". Also the left hook is thrown not so much with the elbow being drawn back, but the focus being on dropping / turning the right shoulder to give power to the subsequent shift in bodyweight from the leading foot to rear foot (in an orthodox fighter, of course).</p>
<p>Also, the section on uppercuts reads like an uppercut can only be thrown with the rear hand; this is not the case. Even though many fighters may throw most uppercuts with the rear hand, uppercuts with the lead hand are perfectly legitimate and could not possibly be excluded from a section on uppercuts, as if lead hand uppercuts did not exist. If nobody disputes these comments I will return and edit these sections. --Guardian sickness 23:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
