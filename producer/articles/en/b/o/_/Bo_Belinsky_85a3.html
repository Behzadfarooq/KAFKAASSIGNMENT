<p><b>Robert "Bo" Belinsky</b> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> – <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">November 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> left-handed <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who had a career record of just 28-51, but threw the first <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-hitter.html" title="No-hitter">no-hitter</a> in the history of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim_8ace.html" title="Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim">Los Angeles Angels</a> and the first one at <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodger_Stadium_72ba.html" title="Dodger Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a>, beating the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> 2-0 on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_5.html" title="May 5">May 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_in_baseball.html" title="1962 in baseball">1962</a>. It was Belinsky's fourth consecutive win to start his rookie season; he would be 5-0, then 7-1, before finishing the season with a 10-11 <a href="../../../w/i/n/Win_%28baseball%29.html" title="Win (baseball)">won-lost record</a>, a 3.56 <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">earned run average</a>, and the league lead in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_on_balls.html" title="Base on balls">walks</a> (122), the only time Belinsky ever led his league in any pitching category.</p>
<p>After the no-hitter, Belinsky said, famously enough, "If I'd known I was gonna pitch a no-hitter today, I would have gotten a haircut." Perhaps more tellingly, however, Belinsky also said, "If music be the food of love, by all means let the band play on." Born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_American_a821.html" title="Polish American">Polish American</a> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> father and a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a> mother, and raised mostly in <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenton%2C_New_Jersey_d2cd.html" title="Trenton, New Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, a street rat and one-time pool hustler who was known notoriously enough for his night life even before he made the majors in 1962, Belinsky's rookie no-hitter climaxed a raucous season in which he was already glittering copy for southern California sportswriters with his wit and unapologetic womanising. "Within days of his no-hitter Belinsky would be heralded as sport's most original and engaging playboy-athlete," pitcher-turned-journalist Pat Jordan wrote in a striking 1971 <i>Sports Illustrated</i> profile. "His name would become synonymous with a lifestyle that was cool and slick and dazzling . . . But in time the name Belinsky would become synonymous with something else. It would become synonymous with dissipated talent."</p>

<p>Belinsky became a kind of protege to fading but still influential and show business-connected newspaper columnist <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Winchell_cbeb.html" title="Walter Winchell">Walter Winchell</a>. He was linked romantically, at one time or another, to such beauties as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann-Margret_e176.html" title="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Stevens_11f8.html" title="Connie Stevens">Connie Stevens</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Louise_67a9.html" title="Tina Louise">Tina Louise</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamie_Van_Doren_dc56.html" title="Mamie Van Doren">Mamie Van Doren</a>, the latter his fiancee for a year. Contemporary player <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hegan_2992.html" title="Mike Hegan">Mike Hegan</a> once said, "Bo had more fun off the field than he did on the field."</p>
<p>And it took the inevitable toll on the field. Belinsky fell to 1-7 in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_in_baseball.html" title="1963 in baseball">1963</a> and earned a farming out to the Angels' minor league team in Hawaii, where he pitched his way back and finished the year with a 2-9 major league record. But Belinsky was 9-7 with a career-best 2.86 ERA in August 1964 when came the incident that ended his days with the Angels: a hotel room fight with elderly <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> sportswriter Braven Dyer. Belinsky was suspended from the Angels, then traded to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> after the season. After spending a little over a season with the Phillies, in which he was used mostly as a long reliever before his release to the minor leagues, Belinsky also pitched for the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a>, the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> and the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, before his career ended in the Cincinnati minor league system in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_baseball.html" title="1970 in baseball">1970</a>.</p>
<p>"What was clear," Jordan wrote, "was that Belinsky had dissipated a promising career, that people had grown tired of him, and that most of the problem could be traced to his personality. He did not have the knack of such later athletes - the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Namath_dedd.html" title="Joe Namath">Namaths</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Harrelson_488d.html" title="Ken Harrelson">Harrelsons</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Sanderson_3fd3.html" title="Derek Sanderson">Sandersons</a> - of cultivating his personality precisely up to, but not beyond, that point at which the public became bored with it."</p>
<p>Belinsky married and divorced <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> Playmate of the Year Jo Collins, then heiress Janie Weyerhaeuser. He eventually overcame <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> to become first a counselor and spokesman for the alcohol abuse program he entered in Hawaii and, then, an auto agency representative in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>. Clean, sober, and a born-again <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> ("Can you imagine," he was quoted as saying, "finding Jesus Christ in Las Vegas?"), Belinsky battled <a href="../../../b/l/a/Bladder_cancer.html" title="Bladder cancer">bladder cancer</a> before his death in Las Vegas of an apparent <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> at age 64.</p>
<p>Veteran sportswriter <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maury_Allen_0c08.html" title="Maury Allen">Maury Allen</a> wrote a biography of Belinsky, <i>Bo: Pitching and Wooing</i>, "with the uncensored cooperation of Bo Belinsky," in 1973.</p>
<p><i>I came to the Angels as a kid who thought he had been pushed around by life, by minor league baseball. I was selfish and immature in a lot of ways and I tried to cover that up. I went from a major league ballplayer to hanging onto a brown bag under the bridge, but I had my moments and I have my memories. If I had the attitude about life then that I have now, I'd have done a lot of things differently. But you make your rules and you play by them. I knew the bills would come due eventually, and I knew I wouldn't be able to cover them.</i>---Bo Belinsky to Ross Newhan, in <i>The Anaheim Angels: A Complete History</i>.</p>

<li>In addition to pitching the first no-hitter in Angels' history, Belinsky had the dubious distinction of also being on the losing end of the first no-hitter ever pitched against the Angels—<a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Wilson_d277.html" title="Earl Wilson">Earl Wilson</a>'s 2-0 gem at <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenway_Park_891e.html" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a> of the same 1962 season.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Belinsky's no-hitter was the first of eight thrown by a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> pitcher in a decade spanning from 1962 to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_in_baseball.html" title="1971 in baseball">1971</a>. The others: <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Koufax_b2ac.html" title="Sandy Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> in 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965; <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Horlen_1669.html" title="Joe Horlen">Joe Horlen</a> in 1967; and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Holtzman_2367.html" title="Ken Holtzman">Ken Holtzman</a> in 1969 and 1971.</li>

Forty-four years stood between Belinsky and Weaver.</li>
