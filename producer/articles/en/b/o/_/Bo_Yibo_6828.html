<p><b>Bo Yibo</b>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh"><b>薄一波</b></span>; <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <span lang="pny" xml:lang="pny"><b>Bó Yībō</b></span> (<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> - <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>) was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> politician and one of the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Elders_fe8c.html" title="Eight Elders">Eight Immortals of the Communist Party of China</a>.</p>
<p>He was alternate member and then member of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China_b6f2.html" title="Politburo of the Communist Party of China">Politburo</a>, deputy prime minister, chairman of State Economic Commission and vice-chairman of Central Advisory Commission of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_China_8300.html" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party of China</a>.</p>
<p>Joining the Communist Party of China when he was seventeen, Bo was one of the revolutionary veterans who were purged by the <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>-backed <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang_of_Four_7760.html" title="Gang of Four">Gang of Four</a>, and who returned to power after Mao's death.</p>
<p>Bo was one of a select group of powerful veterans centred around late paramount leader <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> who were informally known as the Eight Immortals for the vast influence they commanded until gradually succumbing to old age and death mostly in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>
<p>By some reckonings Bo was the last immortal to – in Deng’s phrase – “go to meet Marx”, but he is survived by 90-year-old <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wan_Li_06cb.html" title="Wan Li">Wan Li</a>, another former vice-premier widely considered to have been one of the eight.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the term "Eight Immortals" comes from Chinese myth and legend. They are worshiped by <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Daoists</a>, but are also a popular element in secular Chinese culture. It is equivalent to saying <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Musketeers_7b85.html" title="Three Musketeers">Three Musketeers</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a> in relation to events in modern Western politics.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Yibo_6828.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, Bo set up the '<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanxi.html" title="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> Suicide Squad for the Liberation of China', which was widely acclaimed not only as one of the most courageous sections of the Chinese Red Army against the Japanese invaders, but it also became the mainstream force in the struggle to overthrow the <a href="../../../k/u/o/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">KMT</a> regime. Bo was responsible for incorporating the warlord <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yen_Hsi-shan_3d7b.html" title="Yen Hsi-shan">Yen Hsi-shan</a> into the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>, who provided more than 200,000 troops. In return, communists in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanxi.html" title="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> under Bo's leadership helped Yen to implement many reforms that greatly increased the popular support for Yan's regime.</p>
<p>During the civil war, Bo worked with <a href="../../../l/i/u/Liu_Shaoqi_2c51.html" title="Liu Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a> – later persecuted and killed during the Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution (GPCR) – in underground “white” Nationalist-controlled areas. At the end of the war, he was named first secretary of the CCP Central Committee’s North China Bureau (1949-1954).</p>
<p>In the first years after 1949, Bo was <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Finance_5200.html" title="Minister of Finance">Minister of Finance</a>, a position he lost in December 1953 to his political ally of the time, Deng Xiaoping. His ouster was as much the result of a factional dispute with <a href="../../../g/a/o/Gao_Gang_e4d1.html" title="Gao Gang">Gao Gang</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/o/Rao_Shushi_2187.html" title="Rao Shushi">Rao Shushi</a> as it was about fiscal policies deemed insufficiently pro-state.</p>
<p>Later in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, he was among the veteran planners resistant to Mao Zedong’s economic policies. Others in opposition to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Leap_Forward_dece.html" title="Great Leap Forward">Great Leap Forward</a> and similar extreme economic measures included <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Yun_8839.html" title="Chen Yun">Chen Yun</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Xiannian_0791.html" title="Li Xiannian">Li Xiannian</a>, Li Fuchun and Yao Yilin. Bo served as Vice Chair (1952-1956) and later Chair (1956-1959) of the State Planning Commission, a position in which he took a leading position in repairing the damage of Maoist economic policies pursued during the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>Bo Yibo was a member of the CCP Politburo from the 8th National Party Congress in 1956 to the beginning of the GPCR, and again in the early Deng Xiaoping era, from 1979 until the 12th National Party Congress in 1982, when most of the elders retired.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, Bo was imprisoned as a political prisoner by <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Qing_e688.html" title="Jiang Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, Chairman Mao's wife, for his pro-democratic activities and for advocating freedom of trade with western countries. He was held in a prison with some of the worst conditions available for fifteen years, during which time his wife was beaten to death. His sons and daughters were either imprisoned (e.g. Bo Xiyong, Bo Xilai and Bo Xicheng, at the ages of sixteen, seventeen and seventeen again respectively) or sent to some of the poorest places in China (e.g. Bo Xining, at the age of fourteen). During the Cultural Revolution, Bo was struggled in public for 136 times, and interrogated for 206 time. The most common way of torture by <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Guards_c728.html" title="Red Guards">Red Guards</a> was to struggle and interrogate him in the early morning and to wake him up at dawn, and the way to wake him up was to grab his limbs while he was asleep, and then throw Bo directly into cold waters from his bed in order to let him have a clear mind to accept the people's re-education. Bo Yibo, however, did not crack under such pressure and in his 7 ft by 7 ft jail cell, he developed his own excerise to strengthen his body and mind to stay healthy, and called his own excersie the 7-step drill. This experience resulted in a mixed attitude toward the reform later on, while strongly supported the economic reform, Bo was reluctant to support the political reform.</p>
<p>Bo important contribution toward the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_economic_reform.html" title="Chinese economic reform">Chinese economic reform</a> was mainly in the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, when the reform was at its difficult time in its infancy. During the debate on whether free market economy should be allowed or not, Bo was firmly on the reformers' side. Once the free market economy was allowed, the hardline conservatives attempted to restrict it by limiting the maximum number of employees each private enterprise could have: no more than eight according to the orthordox <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, because anymore would be exploitation. Bo Yibo's support of private enterprises in free market economy was instrumental in helping to defeat the hardline conservatives' attempt to thwart the market reform. Bo's further support of economic reform came from one of his trips to <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> facilities in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the 1980s. During his visit, Bo discovered that there were only two airplanes parked at the facility so he asked Boeing executives that if those two were gone, then there would be nothing left. Boeing executives answered that it was exactly what they wanted because they production is based on customers' order and anything more than necessary would be a waste of money and other resources, just like when they could not fill customers' orders according to the schedule. After this visit to Boeing, Bo became much more critical to the Chinese practice of planned economy, accurately pointing out that the excess production plans were in fact a waste on resources, and even for the planned economy, it should be planned market economy instead of the rigid Soviet style planning.</p>
<p>Despite his support of economic reform, Bo was by no means a reformer like <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Yaobang_bfaf.html" title="Hu Yaobang">Hu Yaobang</a>, <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhao_Ziyang_9bc5.html" title="Zhao Ziyang">Zhao Ziyang</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wan_Li_06cb.html" title="Wan Li">Wan Li</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Qili_0c5d.html" title="Hu Qili">Hu Qili</a> in the political reform arena: after the 1982 12th National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Bo was kicked upstairs to the vice chairmanship (equal to politburo rank) of the toothless CCP Central Advisory Committee, but remained instrumental in removing CCP Secretary General <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Yaobang_bfaf.html" title="Hu Yaobang">Hu Yaobang</a> from power. He returned to a leadership position when he urged a crackdown on the <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989_f021.html" title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a> and actively supported the removal of <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhao_Ziyang_9bc5.html" title="Zhao Ziyang">Zhao Ziyang</a>. Bo died of old age at almost 99 in a <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> hospital in mid January 2007.</p>
