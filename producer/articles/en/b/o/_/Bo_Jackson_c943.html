He began to show his true potential in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_baseball.html" title="1989 in baseball">1989</a>, when he was selected for the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> team, and was named the game's MVP for his play on both offense and defense.

He also beat out an infield hit that resulted in the game-winning RBI in the game. And, he had a stolen base, making him the only player in <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_All-Star_Game_c500.html" title="MLB All-Star Game">MLB All-Star Game</a> history to hit a home run and steal a base in the same game.

With speedy <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Reynolds_88b2.html" title="Harold Reynolds">Harold Reynolds</a> running from first base on the play, Scott Bradley's hit would have been deep enough to score him against most outfielders. But Jackson, from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html#warning_track" title="List of baseball jargon">warning track</a>, turned flat footed and fired a strike to catcher <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Boone_6807.html" title="Bob Boone">Bob Boone</a>, who tagged the sliding Reynolds out.

As he caught the ball at full tilt, Jackson looked up and noticed the wall and began to run up the wall, one leg reaching higher as he ascended. He ran along the wall almost parallel to the ground, and came down with the catch, to avoid impact and the risk of <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injury.html" title="Injury">injury</a> from the fence.</p>
<p>Before Jackson finished his career in California he spent two years playing for the Chicago White Sox. After a poor at bat he was known to snap the bat over his knee, or with his helmet on, over his head.</p>
<p>In his eight baseball seasons, Jackson had a career batting average of .250, hit 141 home runs and had 415 RBIs, with a <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> of .474. His best year was 1989, with his effort earning him all-star status. In '89 Bo ranked fourth in the league in both homers and RBI's with 32/105.</p>

<p>Following the 1987 baseball season, Jackson decided to again play football (just as a "hobby", he said) and joined the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">NFL</a>'s <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Los Angeles Raiders</a>, who drafted Jackson in the 7th round of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_NFL_Draft_a002.html" title="1987 NFL Draft">1987 NFL Draft</a>, after his name returned to the draft pool due to Jackson and the Buccaneers never reaching an agreement.<sup id="_ref-Bo1_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bo1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Joining the Raiders midway through the 1987 season, Jackson rushed for 554 yards on 81 carries in just seven games. Over the next three seasons, Bo Jackson would rush for 2,228 more yards and 12 <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchdown.html" title="Touchdown">touchdowns</a>: a remarkable achievement, in light of the fact that he was a "second string" player behind Raiders legend <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Allen_2b8f.html" title="Marcus Allen">Marcus Allen</a>.</p>
<p>Jackson turned in a 221-yard rushing performance on <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_NFL_season_e726.html" title="1987 NFL season">1987</a> against the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Seahawks_2af6.html" title="Seattle Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>. During this game, he literally ran over Seahawks star linebacker <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Bosworth_6831.html" title="Brian Bosworth">Brian Bosworth</a>, who had insulted Jackson and promised to contain him in a media event before the game. He also made a 91-yard run to the outside, untouched down the sideline. He continued <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprinting.html" title="Sprinting">sprinting</a> until finally slowing down as he passed through the entrance to the field tunnel to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changeroom.html" title="Changeroom">dressing rooms</a> with teammates soon following.</p>
<p>In his four seasons in the NFL, Jackson rushed for 2,782 yards and 16 touchdowns with an average yards per carry of 5.4. He also caught 40 passes for 352 yards and two touchdowns. Jackson's 221 yards on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_NFL_season_e726.html" title="1987 NFL season">1987</a>, just 29 days after his first NFL carry, is still a <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> record.</p>

<p>During a Raiders playoff game against the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_playoffs%2C_1990-91_1510.html#AFC:_Los_Angeles_Raiders_20.2C_Cincinnati_Bengals_10" title="NFL playoffs, 1990-91">1991</a>, Jackson suffered a serious hip injury which ended his football career and seriously threatened his baseball career. After Bo Jackson was tackled and lying in pain on the ground, he popped his hip back into place. In an interview on Untold, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Brett_%28baseball%29_6ead.html" title="George Brett (baseball)">George Brett</a> who attended the game said he asked the trainer what had happened to Bo. The trainer replied "Bo says he felt his hip come out of the socket, so he popped it back in, but that's just impossible, no one's that strong."</p>
<p>Following surgery and rehabilitation on his injured hip, it was discovered that Jackson had <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avascular_necrosis.html" title="Avascular necrosis">avascular necrosis</a>, as a result of decreased blood supply to the head of his left <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femur.html" title="Femur">femur</a>. This caused deterioration of the femoral head, ultimately requiring that the hip be replaced. Jackson missed the entire <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_in_baseball.html" title="1992 in baseball">1992</a> baseball season. When he announced soon after his surgery that he would play baseball again, many thought that goal to be unrealistic, especially at the Major League level.</p>
<p>Jackson was able to return to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_baseball.html" title="1993 in baseball">1993</a>, and incredibly at his first at-bat, he homered on his first swing. The next day Nike ran a full-page ad in <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a>; it simply read "Bo Knew."</p>
<p>He would hit 16 home runs and 45 RBIs that season; but while his power remained, he no longer possessed his blazing speed. During his time with the White Sox, Jackson had no stolen bases. For the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_in_baseball.html" title="1994 in baseball">1994</a> season, he was signed as a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agent.html" title="Free agent">free agent</a> by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Angels_dc4b.html" title="California Angels">California Angels</a> for one final season before retiring.</p>

<p>Jackson became a popular figure for his athleticism in multiple sports through the late 1980s and early 1990s. He endorsed <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike%2C_Inc._7cbe.html" title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> and was involved in a popular ad campaign called "<a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Knows_cb65.html" title="Bo Knows">Bo Knows</a>" which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/g/Luge.html" title="Luge">luge</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_racing.html" title="Auto racing">auto racing</a>, and even playing <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> music with <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Diddley_fe63.html" title="Bo Diddley">Bo Diddley</a>, who scolded Jackson by telling him <i>"You don't know diddley!"</i><sup id="_ref-bo3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bo3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another clip, envisioning Jackson playing <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>, was followed by a clip of <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> shaking his head in disbelief and dismissing the effort with a quick "No." <a href="../../../t/_/s/T_shirt.html" title="T shirt">T shirts</a> sold by Nike capitalizing on their successful ad campaign had a list of Jackson's sports - both real and imagined - with hockey crossed out.</p>
<p>Jackson also poked fun at the ad campaign during a guest appearance on a first season episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Lois_and_Clark%7E_The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_29f2.html" title="Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman">Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</a></i>.
