<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> Gritz undertook a series of private trips into <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, purportedly to locate <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a> which some believed were still being held by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_republic.html" title="Socialist republic">Socialist Republic</a> of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Those missions were heavily publicized, controversial and widely decried as haphazard - for instance, as some commentators stated, few successful secret missions involve bringing to the border towns women openly marketing commemorative POW rescue T-shirts. All such missions failed to locate any live POWs.</p>
<p>In the book <i>Inside Delta Force</i>, CSM Eric Haney, a former Delta Force operator, claims that the unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of American POWs from Vietnam. However, both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish. Haney also claims that while working in the executive security industry years later, an official from the Vietnamese government asked him why the U.S. never attempted to rescue any of the prisoners that Vietnam held after the cease fire of 1973.</p>
<p>Gritz was the model for Sly Stallone's <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambo.html" title="Rambo">Rambo</a> character. <a href="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/PrintFriendly?oid=oid%3A101480" class="external autonumber" title="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/PrintFriendly?oid=oid%3A101480" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Gritz_75eb.html" title="Edit section: Drug trafficking allegations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drug trafficking allegations</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, after a trip to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> to interview drug kingpin Kun Sah regarding possible locations of U.S. POWs, Gritz returned from Burma with a videotaped interview of Kun Sah purporting to name several officials in the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_administration.html" title="Reagan administration">Reagan administration</a> involved in <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcotics.html" title="Narcotics">narcotics</a> trafficking in Southeast Asia. Among those named was <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Armitage_fc8a.html" title="Richard Armitage">Richard Armitage</a>, who most recently served as Deputy Secretary of State during <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s first term as President. Gritz believed that those same officials were involved in a coverup of missing American POWs.</p>
<p>During this period Gritz established contacts with the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christic_Institute_6ec0.html" title="Christic Institute">Christic Institute</a>, a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> group which was then pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over charges of drug trafficking in both Southeast Asia and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>. He also established increasing contacts with conspiracy theorists of <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">the right</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Gritz established the Center For Action, which was active on a number of issues, mostly pertaining to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a>. Attempting to build bridges among conspiracy theorists and other activists of both <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">the left</a> and right, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> he held a conference in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> called "Freedom Call '90". Speakers at that conference included <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Surprise_8694.html" title="October Surprise">October Surprise</a> researcher Barbara Honegger, Bill Davis of the Christic Institute, conspiracy theorist <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_Mullins_60d1.html" title="Eustace Mullins">Eustace Mullins</a>, and several others. This newfound interest in conspiracy theories proved to be as controversial as Gritz's earlier missions searching for POWs, especially after allegations surfaced of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> directed at one of the speakers, <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_Mullins_60d1.html" title="Eustace Mullins">Eustace Mullins</a>.</p>

<p>Gritz is the author of three books. The first, <i>A Nation Betrayed</i>, was published in 1989 and contained Gritz's allegations of drug trafficking and a POW coverup, based on the Kun Sah interview. The second, <i>Called To Serve</i>, was published in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and expanded on the previous book to cover a wide range of conspiracy theories, including the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Gritz_75eb.html" title="Edit section: Presidential candidate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Presidential candidate</span></h2>
<p>In 1992, Gritz ran for <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> on the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist_Party_%28United_States%29_a236.html#Recent_incarnations" title="Populist Party (United States)">Populist Party</a> ticket. Under the campaign slogan "God, Guns and Gritz", and publishing his political manifesto "The Bill of Gritz" (playing on his last name rhyming with "rights"), he called for staunch opposition to what he called "<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_government.html" title="World government">global government</a>" and "The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy%29_92d5.html" title="New World Order (conspiracy)">New World Order</a>", ending all foreign aid, abolishing the Federal Income Tax and the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_System_b397.html" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a>, and openly proclaimed the USA to be a "Christian Nation", stating that the country's legal statues “should reflect unashamed acceptance of Almighty God and His Laws." He received 106,152 votes nationwide, or only 0.1% of the popular vote. In two states he had a respectable showing for a third party candidate: <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>, where he received 3.84% of the vote, and <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, where he received 2.13% of the vote. In some counties, his support topped 10-12%; likely significant to these results is that Gritz had <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">converted</a> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (colloquially, the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> church). He is no longer associated in any way with the LDS or Mormon Church. His run on the Populist Party ticket created further controversy, because of that party's past ties to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willis_Carto_4952.html" title="Willis Carto">Willis Carto</a>.</p>
<p>Also during 1992, Gritz attracted national attention as mediator during the government standoff with <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Weaver_bb3f.html" title="Randy Weaver">Randy Weaver</a> at <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_Ridge_1528.html" title="Ruby Ridge">Ruby Ridge</a>, Idaho.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, Gritz changed his emphasis again and began offering a course called SPIKE (Specially Prepared Individuals for Key Events), which taught <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivalism.html" title="Survivalism">survivalist</a> skills. He also established a community in Idaho called Almost Heaven. Both of these proved to be even more controversial than his past activities, attracting charges from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-racist.html" title="Anti-racist">anti-racist</a> watchdog groups that he was trying to build a community of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Patriot_832c.html" title="Christian Patriot">Christian Patriot</a> believers and train them in paramilitary skills for a showdown with the government.</p>
<p>Several times he used his influence and reputation in the Patriot community in attempts to negotiate conclusions between legal authorities and Far-Right activists. In August 1992, he intervened on behalf of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Weaver_bb3f.html" title="Randy Weaver">Randy Weaver</a> who, with his family, was holed up on his rural home in <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_Ridge_1528.html" title="Ruby Ridge">Ruby Ridge</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, after U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest him on a weapons charge. The 11-day standoff, which resulted in the deaths of a U.S. Marshal and Weaver's son and wife, ended after Gritz convinced Weaver to leave his cabin, and place his faith and trust in the court system. In 1996, he unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a conclusion to the stand-off by the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana_Freemen_0bce.html" title="Montana Freemen">Montana Freemen</a>, a group of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Patriot_832c.html" title="Christian Patriot">Christian Patriot</a> activists who were wanted on a collection of charges. After speaking with the "Freemen", he left in frustration, stating that they presented him with what he called "legalistic mumbo-jumbo" to support their claims, and cautioned others in the Patriot movement not to support them (The stand-off ended when the "Freemen" surrendered after 81 days).</p>
