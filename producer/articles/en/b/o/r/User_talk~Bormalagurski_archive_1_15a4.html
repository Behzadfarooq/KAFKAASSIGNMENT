Vrlo pozitivna stvar koja govori nešto o tolerantnosti, siguran sam da ovi nacinalisti s moje strane Drine imaju razrogačene oči ko krave, hehe.

<p>Hi Boris! My name is Sascha and I'm writing an article about Otpor. I was reading the talk page on Milosevic and saw that you said you'd been there on October 5 (although if you were born in 1988 you were only 12 years old then?) Would you be interested in talking to me about Otpor/the Bulldozer Revolution some time? You can leave a message on my wiki-page or at my Italian blog which is at saschamarie.livejournal.com.<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsam_ef10.html" title="User:Katsam">Katsam</a> 13:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Boris. I went and looked briefly at your website -- wow! When I have more time I'd like to see the trailer because I can't imagine what the Canada Project might be...Anyway, how would you like to be interviewed? I'll be home (after 10 pm west coast time) late tonight and we could talk on AIM or ICQ, or maybe it would be easier if I just emailed you a few questions? Tell me what's best for you. Thanks again, <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsam_ef10.html" title="User:Katsam">Katsam</a> 23:44, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I did! I still mean to write you back, both to thank you and to ask you about your movies (I watched the trailers) but my projects were due today -- so it's been a little hectic. Thank you for your answers, they were helpful...22:23, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Jeste,a ja vidim da si ti bio tu 5. oktobra,bio sam i ja brate,a plus sam bio i clan Otpora,jer sam upisao u clansku kartu da imam 14 godina,sto je bio minimun,a imao sam 12.... A sto se Milosevica tice,ja sam potpuno promenio misljenje o njemu,ne znam da li u Kanadi imate prenose sudjenja,ali ovde ima,i covek je samo branio Srbiju i nas narod na sudjenju,i zato je ubijen,jer su znali da ne mogu da ga osudeDzoni 01:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Borise,potpuno se slazem sa tobom,Milosevic jeste delom odgovoran i za ratove,ali ja smatram da su za to krivi oni koji su ih i zapoceli,a to su Hrvati,Muslimani i Albanci,kao i inostrane sile koje su ih podrzavale.Ako je za nesto kriv u mojim ocima,to je krivica pred nasim,a ne njihovim narodima,ako je odgovoran za nesto onda je to so su plate bile 5 maraka,sto smo bili u izolaciji i pod sankcijama 10 godina,sto je toliko ljudi napustilo zemlju(ko je mogao,a mnogi su i umrli).Ipak,ne verujem da je on licno naredio ubistva Stambolica,Draskovica,Curuvije,vec sam siguran da je to Mirino delo....</p>
<p><br />
A sto se tice Haga,poptuno se slazem da su ga ubili,pa covek je dan pred smrt napisao pismo Ruskom ministru iostranih poslova da zele da ga ubiju!!!!!!!!!!!!Nisu mogli da ga osude,zato je sudjenje i trajalo toliko dugo,a trajalo bi jos pet godina,sve dok ne umre.A mislim i da su Babica ubili,verovatno se predomislio u vezi sa svedocenjima.Dzoni 16:52, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd recommend walking away from debate on the talk page on the Milosevic article. Just like you can't win a fist fight against a brick wall, you can't convince people of the truth when they've been told lies for so long. <a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 21:53, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't just walk away. I know people, who have been brainwashed by the media, won't change their opinion, but I'll continue to express my opinion, because I've had enough of the entire world demonising all Serbs, I've just had enough. And Wikipedia is not the only place I'm expressing my opinion, watch BBC World, and you might just see my name there. Can you imagine what's it like when someone asks me where I'm from, I say Serbia, and they just don't want to talk to me... And why, just because of CNN... Why does the world hate all Serbs, why? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 22:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sadly many people can't overcome the strength of the mainstream western media. I think you may be taking it out of proportion, though. Even in the United States I doubt very many people could locate Serbia on a map or explain any events of the Kosovo War (the few I've tried to inform about it usually dismiss it anyway). I wasn't trying to say you or your opinion were incorrect, I just think perhaps it would be best not to argue about Yugoslav history with the ideologues and know-it-alls of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 22:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with you. But it's stronger than me, Serbs are like that, we can't stand injustice. I feel so sad that Serbs, who always liked America and the West, are now victims of a higher political game. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 23:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't take it so personally. Serbs may be disliked by a few in America (actually I'm very surprised to hear you've experienced anti-Serb bias anywhere in North America, but I'll take your word for it), but I know from experience Americans are disliked pretty much everywhere. <a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 23:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How can I not take it personally, when others are taking it so personally. I'm not saying that all North Americans hate Serbs, but most of them do. If an American went to Yugoslavia before the war, people would be smiling at him, being very polite, because people in Yugoslavia loved Americans. Even during the war it was like that, untill the NATO bombing. So, the Americans did do something bad to us, I had to spend 76 days of my life as a 10-year-old in a bomb shelter, so I, and other Serbs have a reason to not like Americans. However, Serbs never did anything to America, yet Americans hate us. I've come to realize that it was the administrations fault for the bombing, so now I don't have anything against those Americans that have nothing against me as a Serb. I can understand why a Bosnian or Croat would dislike Serbs, but why North America? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 23:25, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's my point. While there are a lot of partisan moutpieces here on Wikipedia with an ax to grind with Serbia (mostly due to misinformation) I don't think very many regular people in the US (or Canada) have anything against Serbs, or even realize the US was at war with Serbia just a few years ago. I've always felt the NATO intervention in the war was just an example of unneccessary political maneuvering on behalf of a very incompetent administration, and I feel terrible knowing how much suffering NATO caused in the region in defense of terrorists and criminals. I've also wrote extensively on the mistakes and crimes of Wesley Clark during his tenure as Supreme Allied Commander, though find it very difficult to get anyone to notice, testament to the lack of interest/knowledge in the Balkan conflicts. Anyway, as I said earlier, you'd find it much less stressful to pick your battles on Wikipedia, rather than argue with every anon and nitwit who comes along. Just some friendly advice. <a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 23:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The rules were here long before you; they're not "against you" (rather, you seem all too often against them). As for calling you a Serb nationalist, even if inaccurate, it's not clear to me that it's a personal attack; it's at best borderline (though it would probably have been better avoided). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:27, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your support on the Human rights in Croatia article, this user has been repeatedly vandalizing a number of Croatia related pages, inserting factual inaccuracies, reverting indiscriminately, not even wanting to discuss, and breaking the 3RR on numerous occasions, even after warnings. I actually wouldn't mind some of those edits but most ARE clearly factual inaccuracies. It seems he was warned a week or so ago, but now he's just back with a vengance... If you could report him to the admins, it would help tremendously. I don't think he needs to be banned just yet, but this kind of behaviour is unnaceptable, higly disruptive, and unfair towards all those contributers who worked hard to make those articles what they are... Anyways, your help would be most appreciated, and you can say I owe you one if we can make him stop ;) Thanks! --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 00:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, don't be upset because I supported EurowikiJ, I just told him that if those accusations were true I would help him get to the bottom of it. It's nothing personal really, but sockpuppets are really unacceptable and annoying. However, since it was obviously not true then I guess there's no need to push the matter further. Btw, I would suggest that you don't antagonize him, it's completely unnecessary and only lowers your (and his) credibility. Lets just let the matter rest. I think you have shown yourself to be a bona fide Wikipedian and would gladly support your bid for Administratorship if you decide to run for it again. Dont make me change my mind now, ya hear ;) Peace. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 02:08, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, then it's up to us, the honest honorable Wikipedians to show him it's not all bad ;) And I don't think EurowikiJ acted out of malice, he's just high-strung as I am about the whole Medule incident so he may have overreacted, but you have to admit you haven't been a model Wikipedian in the past yourself, have you? No matter, we're all human, we all make mistakes. We can also correct those mistakes. I think you should extend your apologies to Eurowiki, and I'm sure he'll apologize to you and M.B. if he sees your intentions are honorable. I know it's hard to suck up your pride sometimes, but as I said earlier, its harder to build bridges then it is to destroy them. So, what do you say, is it a deal? --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 02:25, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, EurowikiJ has made it clear that he neither wants to cooperate, nor apologize for the false accusation. I have asked him to forgive my mistakes, but he has implicitly denied. I will not crawl on my knees just so EurowikiJ will like me. Also, to comment on WikiMB's contribution on <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, I invited him to join the discussion, even though he has said that he has little interest in articles like that, WikiMB tried to calm the tensions, and as a result of that, EurowikiJ is giving a link to his edits and trying to "prove" something, I'm not sure what... Gonzo, I tried, you can't say I didn't and you can't say that I should understand EurowikiJ, because at this point, he doesn't trust or respect me, so I can't see a reason for ever talking to him again. If he had apologized for the accusation to me, I would have forgiven everything, but now it's too late. Also, he is trying to ruin WikiMB's reputation by sending messages, at first to Croats and one Albanian on Wikipedia, and now to administrators. He thinks that the denial of the Checkuser request is his victory, and that I should've asked for the Checkuser request <b>myself</b> to prove that I don't have sockpuppets. Why don't I just ask for a Checkuser request for all the other users who might have similar interests to mine? I don't feel I have to prove anything to anyone, and this just shows how much EurowikiJ doesn't want to trust me... Also, I will continue cooperating with Gonzo, because he trusts me, and I've made a promise to him that I'll try to be a good Wikipedian, but Gonzo, don't make me cooperate with EurowikiJ, just don't. I wanted to make peace, he is furthering his accusations. Maybe you should ask yourself who's the "good, understanding" Wikipedian, and who's the "bad, uncompromisable" Wikipedian. And forget about the fact that he's Croatian, and I'm Serbian. Also, instead of apologizing to WikiMB, EurowikiJ implicitly said that the administrator saved his ass by not performing Checkuser. I'm used to hostility on this Wikipedia, but please don't f**k with WikiMB, because he has done nothing but usefull contributions to this Wikipedia, and EurowikiJ is determined to eliminate him, because he hates <b>me</b> (not WikiMB?!?!) and that just doesn't make any sense. Thats all I have to say about EurowikiJ, and in conclusion, EurowikiJ, stay away from me and WikiMB, and for that matter, Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/90/Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg/25px-Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 18:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if that's your decision there's not much more I can do. Let me just say I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and maybe, if you continue to make impartial and fair edits others may reconsider their stance also. Please refrain from antagonizing those users further, as it would only serve to prove their point. In addition, I think you should consider editing other, less controversial articles (possibly unrelated to Former Yugoslavia) for a while to show that you are here for the good of the Wikipedia, and not only to push "propaganda" as some would see it. It would also allow time for some heads to cool, and maybe in a few weeks we can discuss this rationally. Until then, peace. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 18:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. And I'm guessing it's just by accident that you come along every time Medule needs to avoid breaking the 3RR and revert for him? You're not kidding anyone, and the matter has been put before the administrators, so we'll just wait and see shall we? If it turns out you're who you claim you are then you have my appologies, but that doesn't excuse you from the unresposible and disruptive behaviour of the last 2-3 weeks. As far as Boris is concerned, I told him I'll give him the benefit of doubt until it's proven otherwise. If what you say is true, link to the proof, and I'll reconsider my stance. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 19:25, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, so I've checked out the discussion and the administrator says they're either the same user or two users working in close concert. If what Boris tells us is true, about M.B. being his friend whom he introduced to Wikipedia I think it would be possible for that story to check out. However, in light of two potential sockpuppets accusing each other of being sockpuppets I find the situation too rediculous to continue wasting my time with either. All the comments and edits I ever made were in good faith, and if I've been fooled, you can be sure it won't happen again. So, until this fvckin mess is resolved, please don't contact me or ask for my opinions.

<p>I've had enough of Wikipedia. As of this moment, I will stop editing for Wikipedia, and I doubt I'll be coming back. I have been wrongfully accused of having a sockpuppet, the amount of distrust is just too much for me. But, please, please, unblock WikiMB, he's not like me, he wants to make good contributions, and doesn't deserve this disgracefull way to finish editing for Wikipedia. Please, block me, but unblock WikiMB. Also, if we are the same user, I doubt I would be able to make any edits while he's blocked, doesn't that tell you something? Anyways, bye Wikipedia, I had a lot of fun, and also lost a lot of nerves, advice for new users: If you're <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbian</a>, go away, these people hate Serbs, trust me.
