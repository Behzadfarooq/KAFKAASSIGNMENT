<p>Hey Boris, I just used Adobe Illustrator, but I saw your diagram, it's beautiful, make some more pathway diagrams for wikipedia, I personally think their very important.... <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdenosine_0f27.html" title="User:Adenosine">Adenosine</a> | <i><a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdenosine_1860.html" title="User talk:Adenosine">Talk</a></i> 00:36, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I have been doing this for quite some time, actually for more than 2 years, so i already have many of them and i plan to load them one by one on the appropriate Wikipedia pages, if necessary of course. I also tried to create a color sheme so it's easier for the eye to spot the different elements in the diagrams. ISIS Draw is exelent for drowing chemical bonds, but it had its limitations when i tried to use it for other type of diagrams, such as those for the signaling pathways, where programs like Adobe Ilustrator would be a lot better tool. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">BorisTM</a> 11:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Boris - Please note that I reverted your "info box" change to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatine.html" title="Creatine">Creatine</a>. I agree that using the {Chembox simple organic} template is less-than-ideal, but there is an alternative which is arguably better, and it is certainly much better than the one you seem to be advocating. See <a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBioChemInfoBox_0a69.html" title="Template:BioChemInfoBox">Template:BioChemInfoBox</a> for details. You have obviously given some thought to your approach, and I'm sure it works well for you, but it is non-standard, error-prone (in the creatine info box, where is the title?), difficult-to-use for non-experts (e.g. how do you know what the "vocabularly" is?), and has many other drawbacks.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to know why you omitted SMILES (which is widely used), but included EINECS (which was superseded by ELINCS in 1981). <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 17:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, i was just crusing through your profile. Anyway, i preffer to discuss this and other issues on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_47d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology">Molecular and Cellular Biology project's</a> page in the "Templates/Infoboxes/Small molecules" section.

<dd>Sorry, but I didn't see much there. In any case, I would prefer not to clog a project page with preliminary discussions such as this. Another preliminary question is: why "OrganicBox_PubCnem"? Shouldn't it be PubChem?<br />
On the larger issue, since a template can include other templates, you might want to consider a combined approach. I suppose it ultimately depends on how much variation you think should be allowed between articles. <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 18:57, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Well, whereelse do you suggest we talk about it? Here, only two of us will discuss it, there - more people will join, more ideas will come.<br />
It has to be OrganicBox_PubC<b>h</b>em, i have made a typo and hadn't noticed it, thanks.<br />
I totally agree, there will be articles that will not have some of the info, for an example <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glucose.html" title="Glucose">Glc</a> doesn't have p<i>I</i> so having this in the Glc info table is a waste. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">BorisTM</a> 19:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Boris<br />
I agree with Peak that your infobox, although a good intiative, it not right at the moment. It is far to big for the purpose it serves and as Peak also mentioned is not standard. I would definately be in favor of including a title containing the name of the compound. I hope you respond soon, otherwise I might change the aminoacids which now have your box back to the standard Chembox. Also, I would like to ask you not to use so many abbreviations in the texts you write because they make reading very difficult.<br />

<dd>Dear Boris: I am not sure why you think the PubChem CID should be included in the Infobox (the CID is a "Link to Entrez PCCompound"), but if you do, then I would suggest you give the link to the actual page, along the lines of <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubChem_a50b.html" title="PubChem">PubChem</a> <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=602" class="external text" title="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=602" rel="nofollow">602</a>, that is, using a suitable variant of the following:</dd>

<dd>Peak, i think it's important to have a link to the compound's PubChem page because through the links in the top half of that page Entrez offers very convinient way to pull out of the PubMed database (the largest such databasa, i think) all the published articles about the compound. Well, the readers can do the search on their own, i just think that sending them straight to that page will save them time. Wikipedia and PubMed are very powerfull online resources that complement each other and i just want to see them conectect in some way.<br />
I tried to do it this way but it seems when it's part of a template it doesn't work, kinda strange. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">BorisTM</a> 09:31, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll look at the isoforms issue later. In the meantime, please take a look at Template:ATCRow, which allows for conditional inclusion of a row in a table. Consider for example <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epinephrine.html" title="Epinephrine">Epinephrine</a>. At present, the ATC code has to be given outside the infobox. Including an ATC code row in every organic chemical infobox is obviously undesirable. Of course one could have a wide variety of infoboxes, but the technique illustrated in Template:ATCRow can still be used in their construction. Please note that to omit the row, you have to write {{ATCRow|ATC=}. That is, a null value of the parameter must explicitly be given.<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 20:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately, <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">User:Physchim62</a> has "vetoed" external links in infoboxes because, as he wrote, they:</p>
<dl>
<dd>.... cause a few problems:
<ol>
<li>External links in tables are badly rendered by some browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer), which expand the links when the page is printed.</li>
<li>External links should not be placed "inline" in the article text as they tend to be fragile: instead they should be placed in an <i>External links</i> section at the end of the article (See <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> and the pages referred to from there)</li>
<li>The amount of data we <i>could</i> include in tables is almost endless, especially for compounds such as <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">Ammonia</a>: the current form of the tables is the result of a long compromise to try to keep their length to a reasonable level. Data which could be included elsewhere in the article should be; other data can always go on the <i>Supplementary data page</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case of PubChem, the third point misses the point, but the first point is a drag.<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 17:05, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Boris!</p>
<p>I'm a chemical engineer doing a masters' in biochem, recently working at a health foods, dietary supplements and cosmetic company. I was suprised to see that SOD is added to cosmetics, and wanted to find out why. I noticed that the WP page said nothing about topical application, so I checked it out on Google Scholar. --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 13:53, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>About the link style: The idea is to have a uniform style of article reference. This way, if we decide we now want the journal's issue to be in brackets, or italic or whatever, we just change the template, and all the references change automatically. Also, for someone who is not used to reference styles, you can immediately see which number is the journal issue, and which is the volume (for example) by checking the code.</p>
<p>As for adding a URL, good idea. Check how on Template_talk:Journal_reference. --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 18:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Boris, I just reverted your change to the adherin article, because I felt that what little content that was there was still more useful than three&#160;? marks. Also, the biology stub on the page means that interested editors will better be able to find the page. If you still think the page needs blanking, post on <a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerrafire_d6a6.html" title="User talk:Terrafire">my user page</a>.

<p>Hi, thanks for trying to fix the mess regarding this article, it was speedily deleted for being apparent vandalism and a hoax. If you find an article like that again, instead of just blanking it, you should mark it for deletion according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> so that people can find it easier. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 00:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hehe, sorry for being so direct, i am still learning. This little case once again showed, at least for me, that there has got to be a way to minimaze both the vandal acts and the "unprocedural" attempts, such as mine, to correct them by setting an on-line test of questions related to the editing process, Wiki rules and policy, etc, and after scoring a certain amount of points the anonymous user shoud be allowed to register, set up a name and be part of wiki-editing team. Also there should be a warning system for any registered users, such as myself, who uses any kind of "unconventional" ways. I shall assume that this was a warning of the lowest possible level. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 15:14, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So my personal policy on categories is that if an article belongs strongly in multiple categories, I put them in both. Action potentials are the source of signal for almost every form of neuroimaging (even fMRI potentially), and yet they're very important in the field of neuroscience entirely separate from neuroimaging. Similarly I will place someone who is an important biologist and neuroscientist into both categories, even though "neuroscientist" is a subcat of "biologist". Granted, not everyone feels this way, and if you disagree that's fine and we can continue to discuss it.<br />
Now, because APs are the source of several major forms of signal for neuroimaging, I chose to include it. As you pointed out, glycolysis causes the buildup of FDG, but FDG is only one type of radioligand used in one type of imaging. <i>Reductio ad absurdum</i>: everything should be within <a href="../../../a/t/o/Category%7EAtoms_b111.html" title="Category:Atoms">Category:Atoms</a>, but we generally choose a cut-off point. If you feel <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glycolysis.html" title="Glycolysis">glycolysis</a> or <a href="../../../a/x/o/Axoplasmic_transport.html" title="Axoplasmic transport">axoplasmic transport</a> should be in the category of neuroimaging, you could present your arguments over on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Neuroscience_f664.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Neuroscience">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Neuroscience</a> for starters. I could be persuaded for axoplasmic transport more easily than glycolysis.<br />
Speaking of which, if you're interested in neuroscience, you should join us over there.&#160;:)<br />
If you'd like a more concise explanation for why I didn't put more into the category: I just created the category last night and populated it with the most obvious of articles, and I'm certain I left articles out! <font color="#6D603B">Semiconscious</font> · <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemiconscious_7225.html" title="User talk:Semiconscious"><font color="#6D603B"><small>talk</small></font></a> 17:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The information that memantine is a 5-HT3 antagonist is straight from the prescribing information: "Memantine also showed antagonistic effects at the 5HT3 receptor with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor...". Since NMDA antagonism is its primary (and therapeutic) effect I thought this might be relevant. Here's the reference: <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic3/namenda_cp.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic3/namenda_cp.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarn_1b90.html" title="User:Karn">User:Karn</a> 04:22 26 Jan 2006 UTC</p>
<p>I would have added a reference to the official prescribing information, but I guess your reference is just as good. If your objection to my earlier edit was merely the lack of a reference, I would have appreciated it if you'd simply added an appropriate reference instead of reverting the edit.</p>
<p>I just added that memantine is being trialed for indications other than Alzheimer's, such as depresssion, glaucoma and neuropathic pain. And I added a reference that I hope that meets your approval. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarn_1b90.html" title="User:Karn">User:Karn</a> 22:50 26 Jan 2006 UTC</p>

<p>The Wikipedia cannot use copyrighted images without permission. I would suggest one of two things. One, you could recreate the images as you suggested at first, although this would take some time. Or, secondly, you could contact the copyright holder (i.e. the website) and ask permission to use these images on the Wikipedia. Regardless of whether an organization is free, non-profit, or public, if they exert copyright then it is no different than if a for-profit private corporation exerts copyright.

<p>Hi Boris, thank you for your comments on the amino acid and DNA images. As for the AAs, I tried to use ball and stick models, but they looked decidedly weird when used in the small size that fits in their infoboxes. I will remake the models that you took down.

<p>Are you 100% certain that the painting is about the 1st Balkan war? I wasn't quite sure myself, so I asked a friend of mine to take a look and he said that it can't be the 1st Balkan, because the Turkish soldiers' uniforms looked different in 1912.</p>
<p>Георги Антонов 20:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if the painting was created by Gydjenov or Veshin (as <a href="http://www.president.bg/en/paintings.php" class="external text" title="http://www.president.bg/en/paintings.php" rel="nofollow">the website says</a>), neither i know if the uniform of the turkish soldiers back in 1912-13 was the same as the one on the painting. All i know is - the enemy soldiers are turks not serbs (you can even see their "fesove"), Bulgarian army never fought with the Turkish army during the Serbo-Bulgarian War.<br />
Now a bit of topic, plz take a look <a href="http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Уикипедия_беседа:България" class="external text" title="http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Уикипедия_беседа:България" rel="nofollow">here</a>, we have to do something about it. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 21:36, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>&#160;?! These are not fezes, these are just hats, the Bulgarians had the same. As for the painting's author, it's Vesin, my mistake. I was not quite certain wether the painting is about the Serbo-Bulgarian war, I just don't have my history schoolbook around but if the hats are your only proof, it's not enough. The fezes were red, these hats are brown. And the uniforms are different, as my colleague said. BTW - If you're Bulgarian, write in Bulgarian (I assume so by the name Boris)
<dl>
<dd>I just found some info on the painting, it was made in 1913 - then it's most probably about the Balkan war, as you said. Thanks for removing it then. By the way, it's really frustrating that there's no info on the painting on the net, at least in Bulgarian!</dd>

<p>Thanks for alerting me re categories of Neuroendocrinology; this category tree within Neuroendocrinology is not sensible, and it hadn't occurred to me that anterior pituitary hormones would be a subcategory. As for receptors and transporters, in the absence of a category within Neuroscience for these it seemed sensible to move them out of Neuroscience into the most cognate subcategory. However, I'll desist pending a rational recategorisation.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 13:17, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re Image changes to beclometasone &amp; betamathasone - sorry, I was just trying to help&#160;:-) It is clearly down to what is best across a number of different browsers: the images had come up as tiny within the table on my Internet Explorer with a screen res of 1280x1024. This was largely because of the wide blank margins the pictures originally had (I.E. correctly zooms pictures in or out with this drugbox) - hence why I cropped them. The red "O" and green "F" I just transferred the style seen in one picture to the other. Many other medicinal drug articles use this same drugbox, it usefully collects chemical names, molecular weights, outline of metabolism and legal/pregnancy status away from the text that can then get on and describe the development, indication and use of the drug.</p>
<p>Given the need to manually split long drug names, is there a best practice in wikipedia as to when to do this, i.e. at what screen resolution should it be assumed most readers have their monitors&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 13:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In general it is a good idea to tag any important HTML element (such as the infobox table) with "id" b/c that way it is very easy to use javascript to find the element and later to manipulate its content, layout, delete this and that including the whole element. In my case i have javascript files, attached to my "monobook.js", that do this kind of changes, they make all the infoboxes have the same layout so this way i don't have to wonder which one of all the infobox styles to use - i just use the style i like.

<p>Thanks for the recent tidy up of reference mark-up in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minocycline.html" title="Minocycline">Minocycline</a>. But some queries/thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reference to published papers should also include the authors, in addition to article title and journal details.</li>
<li>Why the use of numerical rather than descriptive tags for each reference name&#160;? It may be initially easier on writing a new article to keep track, but gets progressively confusing as additional references get slotted-in (either all reference numbers need be shifted up, or one accepts Ref No X coming between A &amp; B). The new cite:ref system seems to be creeping in which copes with duplicate references, and allows additional references to be inserted without needing regard to how they are ordered.</li>
<li>The "free text image", I get the idea, and quite like the icon - but is having an icon to indicate references having full free text access an accepted wikipedia style&#160;?
<ul>
<li>One might hope that as a default all hyperlinked references (whether to websites or specific articles) are the "full deal". It is only specialist publications that provide either an abstract of another's work (as with PubMed) or of their own pay-for full articles (as with most medical journals).</li>
<li>Hence whilst I now know that any PMID reference is only going to be an abstract, my expectation remains that any other reference phrase that identifies a link (e.g. "Report", "PDF", "Letter", "Discussion") on a medical/scientific topic is likely to be to a full item - so is there any need for a specific icon&#160;?</li>
<li>Finally given that the icon (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_text.png_42fe.html" class="image" title="Image:Free text.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/1d/Free_text.png" alt="Image:Free text.png" width="9" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_text.png_42fe.html" /></a>) is supposed to be indicating openess of a site to show the full text, would a more intuitive icon be <a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree-text.png_c166.html" class="image" title="Image:Free-text.png"><img src="../../../upload/8/86/Free-text.png" alt="Image:Free-text.png" width="13" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree-text.png_c166.html" /></a>&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 14:44, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have already updated references as per point 1 above. As for rest, I am undecided by this intriguing novel idea and merely seek to understand the idea further&#160;:-) Is this your own idea or have I missed a discussion somewhere&#160;? If widely used, would this have impact on the wikipedia servers; the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_text.png_42fe.html" class="image" title="Image:Free_text.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/1d/Free_text.png" alt="Image:Free_text.png" width="9" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_text.png_42fe.html" /></a> file size is small, but if every page used it then there would be 2 file-fetch cycles for the server to manage&#160;? Have you had any other feedback from other pages where you have tried this&#160;? Would it be worth submitting this as a suggestion for inclusion as an additional mark-up option in the various <i>cite</i> templates&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 13:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Is this your own idea or have I missed a discussion somewhere&#160;?</i><br />
You mean about the <i>{{ref_N}}/{{note_N}}</i> - style (which includes using the images) or just the idea of using the images. The first one is the result of me trying to find an easy, flexible reference system that doesn't "polute" the <b>main</b> text in <i>view</i> or <i>edit</i> mode with unnecesary code so the people can read and edit easily, and i have picked small pieces from anything that i have come across. The second idea is not mine, it is used by PubMed, i just moved it over to Wikipedia that's all. I haven't had any other feedback yet. I have also icons for free review <a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_review.png_c1f2.html" class="image" title="Image:Free_review.png"><img src="../../../upload/4/41/Free_review.png" alt="Image:Free_review.png" width="11" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_review.png_c1f2.html" /></a>, free book <a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_book.png_29f4.html" class="image" title="Image:Free_book.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/1b/Free_book.png" alt="Image:Free_book.png" width="9" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_book.png_29f4.html" /></a> and free comment <a href="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_comment.png_ffa6.html" class="image" title="Image:Free_comment.png"><img src="../../../upload/6/62/Free_comment.png" alt="Image:Free_comment.png" width="7" height="11" longdesc="../../../f/r/e/Image%7EFree_comment.png_ffa6.html" /></a> - their design don't have to be this way. The only reason i decided to use them is because they make it easier to spot the free resources, for guys like myself who don't live in the academic environment, that offers free access, having this is kinda helpfull.<br />
I'm not sure how well this is going to work considering how wiki renders the pages, it could slow everything down. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 18:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BorisTM, thanks for your message. I hadn't actually given much thought to the dipropionate ester issue, but you're correct that they are two distinct molecules. Accordingly, I have changed the article back to "beclometasone dipropionate" (and added an explanation to the talk page) to avoid ambiguity. By the way, it's not just "us" pharmacists that call it that – "beclometasone" is the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Nonproprietary_Name_2c70.html" title="International Nonproprietary Name">International Nonproprietary Name</a> specified by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Health_Organization_57ba.html" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>. -<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechelf_1565.html" title="User:Techelf">Techelf</a> 10:48, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Copyrighted.gif</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>I am currently on forced vacation because of illness and have found that editing Wikipedia is a great way to kill time while a recover. I thought that it would be a good idea to set up a cell signaling/signal transduction project to organise and improve the articles on the subject, probably as a daughter project to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_47d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology</a>.

<dd>Hi, Peter. I love cell signaling, actually I love everything that is "cell" related but this is the top, the cell-signaling network does the same job for the cell as the nervous system for the body - evaluation of the signals and making a decision. I don't want to sound in a way that will kill your "daughter project" enthusiasm - you can organize and improve the “cell biology”-related articles without the need to set up this project, so far you have done a great job. Look at the message activity of the mother's project and you'll see why I’m so pessimistic. Plus there is something more about setting up a project besides creating it’s page and it’s categories for the classes of the articles.<br />
I’ve been doing “template” and “small molecules” work lately, and i have the feeling that i've been ignoring the “cell signaling” quite a bit, i also had a plan to start making diagrams with the reaction mechanisms for the enzymes pages, but i put it in the "i'll do it later"-folder and almost forgot about it. Feel free to start with the signaling diagrams, don't hesitate, they will be great additions to all the cell signaling articles. If you have any ideas just drop them on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_646d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology</a>, and whoever is interested will get involved. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 22:18, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Re: your message on my talk page ... alphabetisation of categories is somewhat controversial, I believe. I can't remember where I read the matter, but I definitely read a concensus somewhere that they should be in some kind of priority order rather than alphabetical order. As far as the data pages go ... it's not at all my area of expertise, to say the least of it: I do think, though, that they're worth categorising, which is why I've been doing so as I work through <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category%7ECategory_needed_86cb.html" title="Category:Category needed">Category:Category needed</a>. (For what it's worth, it seems to me to be eminently sensible to have the data pages and to have them categorised as such.) I'll try to remember to alphabetise stub-tags, though. Cheers.</p>

<dd>Point taken that in the case of the chemicals priority makes very little sense ... it's more relevant if you've, say, got a politician who's also a businessperson, so you categorise him as both. Things like that.

<p>BorisTM, I may have asked you this question already once, but I keep on having trouble exporting files from ISIS 2.5. It creates a null file on the drive, then stops. At the moment I use PrintScreen to send it PhotoEditor, but I would like to export proper images. Do you have any advice on how to make this work? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 18:30, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What ISIS 2.5 does is it creates two files and puts them in the same folder: one has the same name as the one you have given - this is the "zero" file you are talking about and you don't deal with it, the second one is a ".wmf" (windows metafile) and it always has the same wierd name "$$$" - this file is huge and packs a lot of info (for the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acepromazine.html" title="Acepromazine">Acepromazine</a>'s $$$ - 501K). You can open this file with any image viewer, but they use it diferently: "InfanView" keeps the original dimentions (320X179 for Acepromazine) and for some reason doesn't allow the use of all that 501K - if you try to increase the dimentions the image gets distorted; MS Paints opens it but doesn't display it right at all. And up till about an year ago i had problem exporting the files and i had to do other tricks like "copy-paste" from ISIS to MS Paint, etc. Heh about 2 years ago i tried to buy Dell comp on-line but for some reason they decided that my acount wasn't reliable or something so they didn't charge it and didn't send me the comp but they still sent me the free Dell printer that was part of the offer. The printer sucked but it came with "Dell Photo Editor" which i had never actually used untill one day while i was trying to find any image editing program, that i might have had on my comp, i kinda came across it for the "second" time so i gave it a shot and it opened the "$$$" and the dimentions were 2800X1700 and i was like "WOAH". So now i use it to manipulate the "$$$", save it as a ".png" and upload it to "WP". All you need to do is find a program that do the same as "Dell Photo Editor". If you ISIS doesn't want to create the "$$$" file then i don't know how to help you.<br />
<br />
P.S. How do you export? -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 19:35, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for the chemical formula alternative. I previously had a go using the #IF:, but clearly did not understand either this or template markup sufficiently as it made an awful mess. There are a few things it would be nice to change on the template, could you explain how I might so edit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DrugBank row is optional and currently uses a 'hiddenStructure' class to achieve this. How can we switch this to the #IF:&#160;? (I think I previously must have miscounted brackets or pipes&#160;? - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ADrugbox&amp;diff=55408319&amp;oldid=55354427" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ADrugbox&amp;diff=55408319&amp;oldid=55354427" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>)</li>
<li>It would be nice to have an additional whole section for additional physical properties. Each parameter can be hidden if its value is not provided (as per point 1 above), however we would also need to hide the header row. To do this one would need test if any of the section's parameters are defined. #IF: does not take operators, as I understand (so no 'Param1 is blank and Param2 is blank'), but can one concanate values (i.e. '(Param1 &amp; Param2) is blank') eg {{#IF: {{{melting_point}}}{{{combustion_point}}} | .... so that if all the parameters are undefined then the header is not displayed&#160;?</li>
</ol>

<p>Some problems with the image you made of the structure of <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flupentixol.html" title="Flupentixol">flupentixol</a>: first, the O at the end of the chain should be an OH.</p>
<p>Secondly, the double bond from the carbon opposite the sulfur is twisted so much it almost looks bicyclic; it should be linear. Can you fix those? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 21:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

About the second one - it is not a double bond, this bond drawing style is to represent a single bond that could be in either L- or D- configuration. Normally swithcing the configuration affects the biological (pharmacological) properties (example - the amino acids), but in this case it doesn't and as either one of Flupentixol's configurations can be used as a drug (including their racemic mixture) i thought it was important to draw them both. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 00:33, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there.

The IUPAC name, and other structures I've seen elsewhere, indicate that there are two benzene rings (I've bolded the relevant bits) in this molecule: <i>tetrahydrofuran-3-yl [3-[(4-amino<b>phenyl</b>)sulfonyl-(2-methylpropyl) amino]-1-<b>benzyl</b>-2-hydroxy-propyl] aminomethanoate</i>.

<p>Hi I wonder if I could seek your greater expertise on this template again.

<dd>Unfortunately nolonger seeks default image based on articles name. So yes finds all types (english.wikipedia and commons) images <b>if defined</b> and no red link shown if no image exists.

Example case is <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flucloxacillin.html" title="Flucloxacillin">Flucloxacillin</a> where the image Flucloxacillin.png exists but the template markup in the article fails to define the parameter <b>image</b> (currently image shown, yet your code resultant in nothing). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, this naming theory came after you messaged here, at the time of my edit all i saw was two compounds that differed by a double bond, i didn't read the Esomeprazole article, so i wasn't aware of the isomer issue.

<p>You had objected on my talk page to my tagging an article. Wikipedia is for the general audience and it has to be accessible to the general public. The general idea is that people who are unfamiliar with the subject matter should be able to understand it. My mistake was that I did not mark it with the context template that it really needed rather than the stub and wikify tags. If templates are doing all the work, then there is no need for the article stub, jsut redirect the article to an article with a set of chemical diagrams and references of all the chemicals in the template! The purpose of marking the articles is to invite others to add and improve. It is NOT an act of supervision but a request for help! --- <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkapur_f77a.html" title="User:Skapur">Skapur</a> 20:00, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
