Hi, Boris, I'm sorry I was in there editing at the same time as you, hope I didn't edit conflict you. The History looks a little worrying—please check that I haven't accidentally overwritten any of your changes! (I know the new software was dealing badly with edit conflicts a couple of days ago, at least.) Anyway, I'm all done now, edit in peace! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 30 June 2005 06:53 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've left a comment on your nomination page. My guess is that Mark, the editor who decides about nominations, will not take Cognition's objections seriously, especially if the latter's outnumbered. I'm sorry you're having to put up with this nonsense.

<dd>Well, then I seriously wonder why that is not in the text. Again, it is possible on wikipedia to make your nazi-accomodating point. There is nothing I can/will do about it. I think it is a shame, you do not think so. So what else is new. You are uncooperative to an astonishing degree: you're complaining on my talk-page that I have never asked for the solution just mentioned (mentioning annexation and clearly saying it is not one). That is what I have been typing into the keyboard at least ten times this week. So you can ask yourself again, why it is that the article is unimprovable. I am just not into this kind of stupidity, I know many people here are. Can you imagine how this would be going on? The two of us would take 500 weeks to improve the article, reverter themanwithoutapast not considered.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 8 July 2005 16:52 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've removed the tag. Although minor POV points still exist here and there, I am certain a reader going through the article will understand that most Austrians supported the Anschluss as a unification. Listen, I don't want to make an enemy out of you. Read my edit history on the article and you will see that all my edits shifted the article toward your point of view. I have no POV to push; I just want to save what is in my opinion a very good article from being de-FA'd. And please don't make references to "cheap asian products", this may be interpreted as an ethnic slur. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 8 July 2005 15:51 (UTC)</p>

<li>Fenice, reverting a statement backed by both britannica and encarta will not go down well in your FARC...<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 8 July 2005 16:33 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>for your info, you've reverted back to your edit ignoring the word "annexation" completely ( the one <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemanwithoutapast_c099.html" title="User:Themanwithoutapast">user:themanwithoutapast</a> originally reverted. I've sourced my claims for annexation to be included Fenice; But I actually kind of like your idea&#160;:"You have also not offered a viable solution, that is mentioning annexation and demonstrating it wasn't one - which would be the obvious Wikipedia way to solve a dispute"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>so why didn't you do this? We both agree that a) significant amounts of people and sources call it annexation. and b)The Austrians supported the Anschluss, so it wasn't a real invasion, so what precisely are we arguing about?? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 8 July 2005 16:44 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wanted to say, the reason for me to keep out of the discussion is that I don't think it is possible to talk to<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">user:Fenice</a> in a reasonable manner. Even before he realised that this article exists it was difficult to keep the article to some extend NPOV. Now with regard to Fenice persistent view that the Anschluss was a "joining" meaning a voluntary act by Austria (through its representative body = government of that time) I just don't know where he is taking that from - the point is the German army marched into Austria and Austrians were cheering (not fighting)- if we want to call it an annexation or not, a voluntary joining is something else - for instance Austria's joining the European Union. I also don't see if Fenice is ultra-right wing or ultra-left wing or just wants to have history written his way and to be honest I don't care.</p>
<p>So thx for making an effort to keep the article as a FA, however as for me I will keep myself from getting involved in any history or political articles on wikipedia in the future - they are doomed to be subject to dispute always and forever.</p>

<p>I got your message in regards to the picture on the grave site (on my user page).</p>
<p>Indeed, I have thought about driving out there (I live about 60-80 miles away), but I am very limited on funds. (Plus my big Chevy Monte' Carlo car gets about <b>15'</b> miles per gallon, <i>not great,</i> especially considering I might get lost on the way there and back --and have to pay for photos.)</p>
<p>If this is necessary, I will attempt to take care of it, but Fair Use might allow the pic. Also from an aesthetic or appearance point of view, I understand that maybe it would help to have a picture that meets the highest standards.</p>
<p>I do hope to find time to look into this and address the concerns. Yes, you are right: A large part of the responsability (maybe a majority?) to address concerns lies with me, as the nominator -I raised the nomination, just as I pointed out that others raised objections. (While I'm unemployed, I do spend time preparing for a job search, but this is my "day off," and I hope to "find time.") <i><b>If I do</b></i> <b>take any photos, I hope to include some with me in them, simply to prove that I was really there and I took the photos, so I can dispell concerns about "Did he really take photos?"</b> <i>Of course, I don't need to be in the photo that goes in the article, but it would be good to keep all photos in archival for a record.</i></p>

Virtually all modern applications of the term to later individuals are directly derived from LaRouche theories. They should be removed from articles, based on both an ArbCom decision and on good sense. Many uses of the phrase "American system" in regard to Sun are references to other schemes or theories that are unrelated to Clay's. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:18, September 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your diligence in this matter. Due to your efforts, combined with those of numerous other editors, this article has become yet another example of the success of the Wikipedia approach. Yes, oddball theories are added and may stay for a year or more before being properly addressed. However that is relatively rare, in my opinion, and is more than balanced by our NPOV treatments of those very same oddball theories. For example, our articles about Lyndon LaRouche and his enterprises are the most detailed and comprehensive reference available online.

<p>Sun Yat-Sen is seen as the "father" of modern China by Western conservatives and many moderates, but within China and among progressive scholars this is a contentious issue. Sun Yat-Sen certainly favored some sort of U.S. model, but I am not sure that it is fair to claim that he supported specifically the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_1f67.html" title="American System">American System</a>, and since that is used as a classic propoganda term by the LaRouchites, I would ask for a non-LaRouchite cite for both elements of the claim just to be safe.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 12:46, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, at the moment, the edit summary is only available as the automatic result of the "rollback" link that admins have on diff pages and user contribution pages. However, it is not a requirement to state who's edits you're reverting and what version you're reverting too, its just an easy way for others to keep track of who is making edits that need reverting. You can feel free to just use short edit summaries like "rv" or "rvv", etc. Sorry that that is all I can offer, and good luck patrolling. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">&#160;</a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">siro</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><font color="#627562"><i>χ</i></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo"><font color="#627562">o</font></a> 01:58, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><font color="#000099"><i>"(quoting Mark again, a little later)</i></font> Also, given all the changes, it's rather unstable ATM (50% of the article disappear overnight) so if/when this nom fails, it might be a good idea to renominate it again in a couple weeks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Terri_Schiavo/archive1&amp;diff=22000544&amp;oldid=22000522" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Terri_Schiavo/archive1&amp;diff=22000544&amp;oldid=22000522" rel="nofollow">at 2:25, here at this diff</a>, <font color="#000099">Mark (aka Raul654) clarifies and changes his mind.

It never ceases to amaze me that people will fight over the minutiae of the Wikipedia, but I suppose in the end the scrutiny that every little thing gets can only be a good thing.

I'm also in the US and there are indeed some texts that go into detail (albeit from the western perspective which is good because the Chinese perspective can be easily found on the net) on Sun Yat-sen. (I happen to have the book by Bergere <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0804740119</a> with me right now.) However, these texts will go on for hundreds of pages and into much more detail than what we need. So per User talk:Deryck Chan, if you would like to see the encyclopedia articles, then just drop a note. Just making sure that we cover what the "competitors" cover and not bias the article with the Sun "cult" should be sufficient. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Ji</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang">ang</a> 06:35, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Arbuthnot_1f24.html" title="John Arbuthnot">John Arbuthnot</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Arbuthnot was an amiable individual, and Swift said that the only fault an enemy could lay upon him was a slight waddle in his walk. His conviviality and his royal connections made him an important figure in the Royal Society. In 1705, Arbuthnot became physician extraordinary to Queen Anne, and at the same time was put on the board trying to publish the Historia coelestius. <b>Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley wanted it published immediately, to support their work on orbits, while John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer whose observations they were, wanted to keep the data secret until he had perfected it. The result was that Arbuthnot used his leverage as friend and physician to Prince George, whose money was paying for the publication, to force Flamsteed to allow it out, albeit with serious errors, in 1712.</b> Also as a scholar, Arbuthnot took up an interest in antiquities and published Tables of Grecian, Roman, and Jewish measures, weights and coins; reduced to the English standard in 1705, 1707, 1709, and, expanded with a preface (which indicated that his second son, Charles, was born in 1705), in 1727 and 1747."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> mentions the enmity of Flamsteed, I thought I'd point this bit out. Arbuthnot, incidentally, was a friend of Newton's from about 1695, but Arbuthnot had <i>a lot</i> of friends and never took credit for himself, so no one knows much about his role. (Arbuthnot said, "Biography is one of the new terrors of death," so he intentionally made it difficult for anyone to write a biography.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:12, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for addressing the things I pointed out on the FAC nomination, I haven't changed my vote to support because I'm waiting to see if other people have problems with the content. I don't know enough about him to make such judgements, but comapred to an article like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> it seems kind of thin, for example as far as I can tell there is reatively little summray of the biographcial detail that currently resides in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_writing_of_Principia_Mathematica_0296.html" title="The writing of Principia Mathematica">The writing of Principia Mathematica</a>, and what is mentioned is mixed in with scientific research - which doesn't make much sense now the article has been split into biography, research etc. With this split there is also now a 30 year gap in the biographical information. Shouldn't there also be a summary section for his occult views in addition to that on his religious views?--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:27, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your honesty Borisblue. I see what you mean. However, maybe this discussion here will show you why I did what I did and why it was a mistake <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tony_Sidaway#Thanks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tony_Sidaway#Thanks" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and maybe it will put the issue into perspective. The other allegations of Islam bias, etc. are not true and are why users are making such comments are explained by my responses to some editors. Also the comments by oceansplash may tell you who is actually biased.

<p>Greetings.

People have put up monetary bounties for certain articles reaching featured status - if the article makes it, the bounty lister donates the stated amount of money to the Wikimedia Foundation. So you can work on making articles featured, and donate other people's money at the same time. If this sounds interesting, I hope you stop by. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 13:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I didn't. I considered that possibility. I suppose it might be beneficial to ask, but I also expect that any editor who was the subject of a controversial RfA is very likely to be adamantly opposed to its inclusion as an example at WP:GRFA, as I'm sure they'd like to put the whole thing into the past. If we presume to give them a say in whether it is placed there as an example, we could be left with no examples or perhaps ill-suited examples. Their RfAs are clear cases in point, and are a matter of public record here as the RfAs are not deleted once closed. I think perhaps it's a matter of weighing the good of the many vs. the good of the few; we might offend a four editors, but we might help a large number of editors avoid such contentious RfAs. Certainly it's a grey area. Your thoughts? --Durin 17:33, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><font color="#307D7E">Hi, Borisblue. This is about the lead image on the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Chavez_1fdf.html" title="Hugo Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a> article. Anagnorisis stated that we should use the UN image, since he stated that that site says somewhere that, as long as one does not use images for advertising, using their images is fine. So I switched out the lead image to use the UN image. I hope this works better for you. If we were to do a vote, I suspect we wuld just get one vote for a government picture where he is wearing a sash, and two votes for the UN photo (even though ideally I'd like the red-shirt <a href="../../../a/l/%C3%B3/Al%C3%B3%2C_Presidente%21_64f4.html" title="Aló, Presidente!">Aló, Presidente!</a> picture the best. Bunchofgrapes stated that we should use a formal picture also, stating that it would need to be free use as well. So if you can provide both an official photo AND verifiable documentation that use of the image is allowed for any purpose, then we can take a vote on it.

<li><font color="#307D7E">In the latter comment I even explicitly said that I believed he should not have been listed there and that the project page was used by one of the users for his own aims rather than community's good by listing him there. I wrote that because I in fact did think for a while how did he feel about being listed there for such a non-vague thing.</font></li>
<li><font color="#307D7E">Because of my involvement, Nohat left <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_Archive7_ab0e.html#Truce" title="User:Halibutt/Archive7">this comment</a>, in which he expressed his thanks to me for defending his cause and that he understood the intentions behind that page's creation</font></li>
<li><font color="#307D7E">So, basically <b>you're holding against me what Nohat himself found as my virtue</b>. That's why I felt your comments both on my talk page and RfA are simply unfair. And that's exactly why I decided to post this comment here. While I will not ask you to reconsider your vote, I certainly would like to hear at least some sort of explanation. You're free to oppose my nomination for any reason, but please, pretty please make this reason at least real.</font></li>
<li><font color="#307D7E">BTW, just like you, I've also been on several people's black books, be it real or imagined. That's why I thought that project was supposed to become a discussion page rather than a list of personae non gratae or anything.

<p><font color="#307D7E">Well, Malaysian politics <i>is</i> my hobby.&#160;;-) Besides, there's not much else I can think of that hasn't got an article on Wikipedia, although I might consider writing up something about various Malaysian celebrities now and then (I already did <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicol_David_e521.html" title="Nicol David">Nicol David</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karamjit_Singh_4a87.html" title="Karamjit Singh">Karamjit Singh</a>, but as you can see, they're nowhere near the standard of, say, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_153_of_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia_eb69.html" title="Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia">Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia</a>). And the fact is that the tagline of the DYK entry for <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badruddin_Amiruldin_4081.html" title="Badruddin Amiruldin">Badruddin Amiruldin</a> is accurate — it's hard to take his remarks (and their context) in any other way. (I don't like the DAP very much, especially with their socialist economics and all, but they're better than nothing, IMO. Much of what Gerakan says reflects my opinions, but much of what they do goes flat out against them.) You can check out the video (linked at the end of the article) if you don't believe it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 19:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</font></p>

<dd><font color="#307D7E">Well, of course. But if the DYK guys want to include these articles, I'm not one to stop them, am I? I just suggest them and hope to see if they'll accept it. The Malaysian Malaysia tagline probably wasn't that well-done, but I would still argue it's the literal truth. The uproar when Lim Kit Siang announced his revival of the Malaysian Malaysia campaign would appear to evince that. I think the DYK guys just accept these articles because Wikipedia has too much of a Western-centred approach as it is (also called "systemic bias"). So they'll probably grab whatever non-Western stuff they can get. DYK also doesn't have too stringent standards on these things, unlike the featured article of the day, which is heavily vetted by <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>.

I hope I'll live up to the expectations of those who voted for me. Secondly, I must apologize for ignoring your message about Terri Schiavo as a featured article candidate. I'm afraid, for the same reason, I just didn't manage. I had a quick look at the voting page. There are problems with the footnotes in that article, because sometimes people deleted parts from the main text without deleting the corresponding footnote, so the numbering got botched. Anyway, in the last few weeks, my Wikipedia activity has been limited to things that either wouldn't take up much time or were quite urgent. Sorry not to have been more helpful.
