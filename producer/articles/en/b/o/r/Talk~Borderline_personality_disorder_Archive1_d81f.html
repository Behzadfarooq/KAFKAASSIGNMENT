<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Movies</span></h2>
<p>The movie list is ridiculous and false in many instances. Girl, Interrupted is fine because it is actually a memoir about a woman who is diagnosed with the disorder. Borderline and Bad timing as well, but Single White Female? The Crush? These are weird opinions of someone who knows little about fiction writing and less about mental illness. There is never any mention of BPD in many of these movies. It's, at best, an unfounded opinion, at worst simple mis-education. People come to this site to learn about something. --<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenlight_b139.html" title="User:Jenlight">jenlight</a> 22:04, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Fatal Attraction? EVEN if the women in these movies were actually supposed to have had BPD, the movies themselves are not at all helpful in their discussion of the illness. It's like linking The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to schizophrenia. It's not an accurate portrayal -- when was the last time you heard of someone stalking or boiling pets that had BPD? <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 23:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pointing to popular media as a reference for medical conditions, when the symtpoms of those conditions may be misconstrued as fact is a serious consideration. JenniSue, as for stalking and boiling pets...<i>would you like to see my case files?</i> Fatal Attraction is an extreme, but not inaccurate account of violent versus demure BPD. May I suggest that you refrain from judging things for which you have no point of reference? --<a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> 17:53, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't need a "point of reference" to know that the term borderline personality is/isn't mentioned in a movie. The fact that you have anecdotal evidence of some people with BPD who've engaged in behavioral extremes doesn't mean that it's accurate -- or fair -- to use those examples as representative of everyone who does. How many people with schizophrenia have suffered -- continue to suffer -- because of popular media's portrayal of them as deranged killers? If you treat people with BPD, I would think that you would not want stereotypes about them perpetuated. In any event, you've missed the point -- WHY does a list of movies that don't even mention the term BPD belong in an encyclopedia entry?<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 02:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just as much as there's no reason to include the list of movies in this article, there's also no reason to let this disagreement escalate any further. Many articles on wikipedia seem to develop burgeoning "in fiction" or "in film" sections simply because many drive-by editors will add to them because their experience with the subject is limited to fictional contexts and they naively believe it to be helpful to the article. I agree it's not useful to have this list in this article, and moreover is very bad as JenniSue is correct in noting that the films do not cite BPD explicitly and we're otherwise lacking any references/sources/citations that would connect the two. I also agree with Mjformica, however, that the behavior portrayed in these films is not at all inaccurate. From my professional experience as well I can say that stalking is hardly unusual, and though boiling pets is very specific, behaviors of similar severity are not unknown.</dd>

Just because a movie does not specifically cite that it is about BPD does not mean that the behaviors displayed within the movie are not accurate to portray the disorder. The main character in Mommy Dearest was known to have BPD; however the movie never mentions this. Does this mean that the movie can not be cited as an example for those wishing to understand the disorder?</p>

<p>I've seen at least three different Abnormal Psychology textbooks that cite Fatal Attraction as being a film example of Borderline Personality Disorder. In one of the clinics I worked at, we even had trained and licensed people who referred to any patient with BPD coming in as "A Fatal Attraction. I think it should be added back to the list. The fact that they don't talk about it in the movie is moot. American Psycho doesn't explicitly mention Antisocial Personality Disorder, but I've seen plenty of books and textbooks that cite it as a good example.<a href="../../../d/l/m/User%7EDlmccaslin_90e6.html" title="User:Dlmccaslin">Dlmccaslin</a> 03:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Psycho(pathy) is synonymous with antisocial personality disorder, so that's different. I don't see many of the attractive qualities of bpd in Glenn Close's nutter, iirc she's more of a slut than a skilled user of sexual power. Which are the three books citing the film? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalG_1ec4.html" title="User:CalG">CalG</a> 17:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a person who has BPD, I cant assure you that we dont boil or would ever harm any animal. I think the fatal attraction comparison is awful and disgusting. insulting. the one in girl interrupted is more accurate. and if they specifically dont say that glenn close's character has BDP, then I think the movie should not be cited. Most people with BDP LOVE animals and would never ever hurt them. They are a source of unconditional love, and they wont abandon you. The two things that people with BDP worry about the most. Also, it sounds like Glenn Close's character, IF she had BDP must have also had Antisocial personality disorder, if she hurt the animals. Comorbid disorders can not be used to represent one disorder only. olayak</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the 'border' between psychosis and neurosis</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the following passage, because it is inaccurate.</p>
<p><i>Unfortunatly, the biggest problem with BPD is that it is in fact on the border between mental illness (psychosis) and personality disorder (neurosis). This causes a problem, because the treatment to neurosis and psychosis is diffrent. While psychosis often demands hospitalisation, BPD will often prefer suicide over hospitalisation. And therefore this is impossible.</i></p>
<p><br />
The idea that BPD is on the 'border' between psychosis and neurosis is an old one which has been discredited. As is pointed out in the article's opening paragraph, this idea has been superseded by the theory that BPD is primarily a disorder of emotion regulation. Look at the diagnostic criteria: criterion 9 says that a BPD sufferer may experience transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms during periods of stress, etc; but that's as close as the criteria get to saying anything at all about psychosis. <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lowry_a00e.html" title="User:R Lowry">R Lowry</a> 14:20, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the mental health pages being based on public material from the National Institute for Mental Health. Every page on that organisation's website has the banner: "Working to improve mental health through <i>biomedical research</i> on mind, brain and behavior"(emphasis mine). This is not an unbiased source but an organisation that works exclusively within a medical model. NIMH is also exclusively American - under 'Facts about NIMH' and 'Mission Statement' it states 'we harness powerful scientific tools to achieve better understanding, treatment, and eventually, prevention of these disabling conditions that affect millions of Americans".</dd>

<p>Could someone with more knowledge of BPD than I have a look at the nonBP article?

The majority of the content was added in November 2003 by an anonymous contributor, and it has only received copyediting and wikification since then. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 12:55, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will undertake to redress this one, as common wisdom (emphasis on common) has me placed as something of an expert on BPD and its corrollaries.

<dd>Alcoholism and codependence is a false analogy; "NonBP" is entirely dependent on BPD for its definition-- one can be codenpent without ever meeting an alcoholic in your life. The "BP" stands for Borderline Personality, and I don't see why this wouldn't work as well, if not better, as a section of this article instead of a seperate article. ICD-10 (not ICD-9) does actually map pretty well with DSM-IV-TR, particularly in this case. Specifically, what is the difference that you're concerned about here? They're not being presented as exactly equivalent anyway, the criteria are listed seperately. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 03:18, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not a psychiatrist; my job at the CMHC I work at (in Illinois) is in billing. From that, however, I can tell you quite clearly that as far as Medicaid, Medicare, and insurance companies are concerned, ICD codes map directly to DSM-IV diagnosis codes. If there's a subtle difference, we'll need it spelled out, and perhaps it can be explained in the article. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 04:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK...here are my thoughts...(1) Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and BPD are not the same thing. Their criteria are relative. BPD is a subset of EUPD, where EUPD is a <i>medical</i> diagnosis, and BPD is a <i>psychiatric</i> diagnosis -- unless you live in Europe, then the ICD is applicable. I am speaking from the point of view of a diagnostician, not the insurance companies here, siafu. (2) The distinction between the ICD and DSM needs to be made. (3) I will re-write the nonBPD article from a clinical point of view. (4) I will resolve, in the future, not to shoot my mouth off after having taken cold medicine.</dd>

<p>Don't merge, or undo merge, as it seems to have been done already. BPD corresponds to EUPD/borderline type (ICD F 60.31). Do not merge non-BP into this article, because there is a lot more to say about the borderline disorder, there are different presumable causes also a short summary about complex PTSD needs to be added (but keeping the main article on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_%28C-PTSD%29_8bfb.html" title="Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)">Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)</a> separate]]. Add short summary of non-BP article here and leave the bulk of the text on that score in separate article. As of yet, the non-BP article has info only from a popular self-help-book (Stop walking on eggshells), which would not match the more clinical info in this article. If there is more to add from a clinical point of view, I am looking forward to reading that.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 20:11, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't know under what answer to place this; But i would say: Don't merge. As someone said, none so far are psychologists or have any professional experience within the field. Neither am i. But i have been diagnosed with first Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, and later BPD. And even though the difference is subtle, there is a difference. So i would rather have more info on the general Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and link to more spesific under categories like BPD. <a href="../../../m/r/i/User%7EMriswith_edaf.html" title="User:Mriswith">Mriswith</a> 21:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">gender identity</span></h2>
<p>aside from the cursory mention it gets in some highly quoted documents (including diagnostic manuals), there is no actual proof or evidence that gender identity problems have anything to do with borderline personality disorder. this contributes to the widespread alienation, enforced invisibity, and villification of transgendered people who become involved with the mental health care system. i am deleting references to gender identity now, except in the case of quoted diagnostic criteria that should include details showing that there is no clinical evidence for the connection (someone please work on this). reverting to include gender identity should be provided with actual proof and verifiable experience (e.g. as with unbiased comprehensive studies), rather than cursory unexplained mention. thank you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Gender identity issues tend to arise in BPD patients as a function of the dissociative aspects of the disorder, and the collapse of regard for social boundaries. The overwhelming desire on the part of the BP to get connected and stay connected is the engine for this. This condition also helps to account for transgender and same gender sexual liasons within this population; liasons that would not normally occur when the patient is in a stable state. It is a symptomatic breakthrough, and not a co-occurence or co-morbidity. Plainly put, you can't draw a straight line from GI issues to BP issues in either direction. <a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> 14:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy/misuse of the BPD diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>I think this article should include a discussion of the misuse of the BPD diagnosis. It is not uncommon to see people who are difficult, demanding, manipulative and/or unpleasant labelled by clinicians (especially non-physicians/psychologists) as BPD. While people with BPD can be all of these things, those are not the diagnostic criteria. Men who exhibit the same behaviors get labelled ASPD. People who are in the early stages of dementia, are cognitively challenged, and/or head injured show up in emergency rooms because they are emotionally out of control or have attempted suicide or are self-mutilating and the staff just assumes its another BPD patient. Also might be helpful to have some discussion about the fact that many folks age out of BPD -- they may still have distress and problematic behavior, but they no longer meet the criteria -- which argues that it's NOT actually a personality disorder but something else.<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 23:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'll have to provide some references for these assertions; it certainly not obvious that any of these things are in fact the case. In my experience, the exact opposite happens, i.e. personality disorders are very rarely given, even in cases where clinicians will freely admit that their clients meet the criteria, simply because they're not billable. Most often, also, when a client is particularly demanding or unpleasant, it's stated factually in the progress notes (e.g., "Clt. expressed a great deal of anger at this writer", etc.) and the Axis II features are included in the diagnosis without a full diagnosis of BPD or ASPD (or NPD or whatever the relevant case is). <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 03:49, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Women &amp; Borderline Personality Disorder by Janet Wirth Cauchon; Through the Looking Glass by Dana Becker are the two references that come to mind re the misuse of the BPD diagnosis. The primary argument of both authors is that BPD diagnostic criteria are extremely subjective (i.e. "frantic attempts to avoid abandonment") and an attempt to pathologize female behavior. Once a person (usually a woman) is diagnosed with BPD, then it is much easier for clinicians to discount what they have to say. "We all know borderlines exaggerate and outright lie, they're manipulative and superficial"-- everything she says/does/feels becomes suspect. And then, there's no reason to look any further for an explanation for their symptoms.</dd>

<dd>This phenomenon is not limited to psychiatry/psychology -- just ask anyone who's been FINALLY diagnosed with <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibromyalgia.html" title="Fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a>. And, as I mentioned, there's a male version of it with ASPD. You are right that most insurance companies are not going to pay for treatment of Axis II disorders -- but diagnoses are not always made in the context of providing treatment. They're also made in disability/insurance evaluations and forensic cases, where it is advantageous for one side to get an Axis II diagnosis. It's not the bomb that "secondary gain" or "appears intoxicated" (with no tox screen) are, but it can be pretty damning.<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 07:00, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have never encountered an insurer that would reimburse for treatment for any personality disorder, BPD or otherwise (This isn't a practical problem, though, as anyone with a diagnosable personality disorder can also be presented as having a "kosher" Axis-I diagnosis, usually major depression or bipolar II disorder or something similarly "mild" that is really better understood as part of the Axis-II pathology). Clinicians are also wary of doling out diagnoses for personality disorders because the general belief is that they are "death sentences"; i.e., they represent lifelong disorders but cannot be treated with medication, and they're afraid of the potential response of the client or the client's family (or, as mentioned the insurer) to such a designation. BTW, medicaid is possibly the most conservative of all insurers; I'm only intimately familiar with Medicaid Rule 182 in Illinois (which covers mental health), but I would be generally surprised if some other state did have such coverage as it runs rather counter to the Medicaid philosophy. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 23:25, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Summary of edits</span></h2>
<p>Trying to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a>, I made the following edits: Deleted the links to movies that don't specifically reference BPD (not sure about Bad Timing, so I left it for now); deleted a link to DBT that no longer worked; removed "manipulativeness" from the list of impulsive behaviors (I'm not disagreeing manipulativeness is a symptom of BPD; I disagree that manipulation is impulsive behavior); and cleaned up the NonBP section to indicate that the experience of a relationship with someone who has BPD is universally negative/requires therapy or extraordinary support. While this may be a common (or commonly discussed, which is different) experience, I do not believe it can be verified as universal. Also added specifics of extreme behavior (but did not include pet boiling :) )<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 02:52, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I took this part out:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An additional factor is that borderlines, with their irrational outbursts of anger and tendency to launch into accusatory rants at loved ones, can push even the most passive people over the edge. This often results in the borderline becoming the victim of violence, particularly in domestic situations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>People need to take responsibility for their own behavior and blaming the victim (no matter how frustrating) for domestic violence is like blaming a child for being molested. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 03:07, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, granted. But what about the concept of the counter-borderline. Just like the counter-dependent, those are people who get pulled into the intertia of the BP person's behavior and start to act all BP themselves. Should that be addressed somehow? It seems like a lot of the literature, like Walking on Eggshells, talks about this sort of thing. What do you think? --Seriphim 16:14, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm familiar with the term, but this has always seemed to me like the concept of the "abuse dyad" in domestic violence -- one individual has the problem (BPD or abusiveness) and the other is trying to obtain some level of control over that problem (abused women who instigate arguments just to get the beating over, for example). It sort of implies that, absent this particular relationship, everyone would be just fine when that's probably not the case. Someone with BPD is going to have BPD even if they're with someone who sets boundaries. Someone who has difficulty setting boundaries (and I say this as a poor boundary setter myself)is always going to have problems saying no and taking inappropriate responsibility even if they're with someone who isn't willing to take advantage of that. Does that make sense?<a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 23:05, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, there is a fair chance that, absent the BP interplay that activates the counter-BP, the counter-BP <i>would</i> be just fine.

<dd>Maybe. But I don't see this as a content issue per say. I have no opinion at all on NonBP or what the effects of BPD is on the family and loved ones of the person with this disorder. It is only a readability issue and in my opinion the deleted content belongs on another page and low and behold it already is there. So its superfluous to copy and paste it here. All we need is a link to the other article. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyjoekoepsel_8d4d.html" title="User:Billyjoekoepsel">Billyjoekoepsel</a> 23:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nice article</span></h2>
<p>Dense, but informative. I added a sentence. Just take it out if you think it's no good. My 2 cents worth. But clinging to people "smothers" them; and the more you worry and mettle with things and ask "what's the matter", the worse it gets. It's the very desperation and needyness in these people that others sense, and often drives the others away. Then they are alone again, and know/feel like they smothered the relationship, and regardless of fault they blame themselves and feel more bad...take it as proof of their unworthiness (even if that's not reasonalble)... Making it harder to generate the self-esteem needed to make a relationship work and get the social support structure set up. It's a cycle. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow_Puppet_55ac.html" title="User:Shadow Puppet">Shadow Puppet</a> 22:09, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe we could improve the readability by removing the second set of diagnostic criteria. DSM IV is more than adequate.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too negative</span></h2>
<p>Hi, would like to offer some impressions.</p>
<p>I realise the article will to some extent reflect psychiatric diagnostic practice which is focused only on clinically-relevant problems. But it also needs to give the wider picture of those individuals being categorised by this diagnosis. And it doesn't seem to come through enough that most of the people being described as having this disorder are people who have been abused and traumatized by others (cf statistics on childhood abuse) and are vulnerable sensitive people (i.e. not just self-harming dysfunctional manipulators) struggling to manage their boundaries, to come to terms with their experiences and emotions, and to feel safe with others.</p>
<p>I think the bias of the article is also given away by the references to those diagnosable with BPD as 'patients' even when not talking in the context of hospital care etc.</p>
<p>I realise the mentions of DSM are hyperlinked to a fuller explanation of the manual and its source, but I feel it should be mentioned alongside it in the article that this is an american and psychiatric publication.</p>
<p>Terms like (low or high functioning) 'Borderlines' appear to be an invalid and potentially offensive application of a specific diagnostic term referring to a mental state. That whole paragraph seems POV or based on unacknowledged psychoanalytic theory.</p>
<p>"people with BPD actually suffer from what has come to be called emotional dysregulation". This is just one theory.</p>
<p>"difficulty in functioning in a socially acceptable manner" - I view this as a judgemental statement. Accepted by some in their society might give a better sense of the relativity, but this isn't a criterion anyway.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Your criticisms aren't making much sense to me. "Accepted by some in their society" means literally the same thing as "socially acceptable", and "high functioning" and "low functioning" are common terms in mental health often determined quantitatively by means of a GAF score or other similar ranking. If you think "client" is a more neutral term than "patient", by all means replace it, of course. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 20:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks, I could have been clearer. I was really referring to the use of the term 'Borderlines'. It's jargon and misuse of a technical term - similar usages that many take offence to these days is referring to 'Schizophrenics' or 'Depressives'. Although I would also argue that if informal functional criteria are being applied, it should be specified what these are (especially when taking a simplified continuous measure of functioning and breaking it into two even more simplistic categories of low and high). 'Low Functioning Borderlines' sounds like the sort of phrase you'd find in a Nazi eugenics guide, to be honest.</p>
<p>My point about the use of the term 'patients' was its use more than once in a the context that had nothing to do with service use. I.E. we are talking about people here, but clearly some only think about them as clinical entities. I will change them but I was also using it to try and demonstrate the apparent biased focus of the article (but as I say I can understand it to some extent because it's following a psychiatric term).</p>
<p>'Socially acceptable' is a phrase with a common pejorative usage, and implies a universal unacceptability. It's the difference between saying I don't personally like something versus describing something as inherently unlikeable. It is more accurate and balanced to indicate that others in the person's society (other societies might not have such a problem) often do not understand or accept some of the behaviors of those diagnosable with BPD. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In point of fact, terms like Borderline, Depressive, Schizophrenic, etc. are jargon...however, they are professionally accepted jargon, and in common usage. As with clients versus patients, the soft sell is for the sake of the one being treated, not the treatment professional, and none of these are intended to be prejorative. One does not refer to a cancer client, or a survivor of cancer...these people are cancer patients, survivors, or remissives.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is my opinion that the sort of position being posited by Franzio is a left over from the client-centered Rogerian nonsense (and I was trained in that nonsense, so this isn't POV) of the late 20th century.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for client versus patient...neither one of these terms is accurate, as it assumes treatment. Good point. Properly, the phrases should be replaced with something like, "individual suffering from..." or "individual diagnosed with..." -- active verbs denote neutrality...copy editing 101. --<a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> 11:54, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think calling people Borderlines or Depressives is as widely professionally acceptable as you suggest, and seems to be becoming less so. And wikipedia articles aren't just for professionals. But yes my point was that people shouldn't be referred to as patients or clients when talking generally, and we seem to agree about the neutrality issue. When referring to a diagnosis, I think 'with a diagnosis of' or 'diagnosable with' would be better and more accepted than suffering from.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I'm not positing a single position, left over or otherwise, I'm trying to reasonably address issues that seem relevant. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 13:24, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

OK I'll probably get stick for this but I've made a few edits throughout the article reflecting the above points. I've removed the 'failure to function consistently in a socially acceptable manner' - as I understand it this is not a recognised criterion nor an established fact so why is it there? And also removed the clearly biased/advertising references to NIMH (presumably due to the page originating from them).</p>
<p>I've also removed the following entire paragraph, for which there appears no factual support and much of which is, imho, clearly offensive and stigmitising.</p>
<p>"Borderlines can be divided into high and low functioning categories. Low functioning borderlines exhibit the well-known patterns of self-mutilation, dipsomania, drug abuse and so forth. High functioning bordelines are often perceived as being extremely charming and even exotic. High-functioning borderline women have a special power to captivate men, even when these women are not particularly good looking, because of their ability to mimic the behavior and interests of the man. <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> High-functioning borderlines pay a steep price for bending themselves to the personalities of their mates. Tension within the borderline rises and breaks out in what appears a childish and unprovoked affirmation of the borderline's true personality. To reestablish her sense of self the borderline then begins to devalue her mate and developes grandiose ideas of her capabilities. Female borderlines often feel they have a mystical mission in the world and it has been speculated that oracles in the ancient world may have been drawn from borderlines. <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>"</p>

The above paragraph has now been reinserted as accurate "now that citations have been found". The single link added at the bottom is to this transcript of a radio interview: <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1244802.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1244802.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1244802.htm</a>. Please could it be specified how this substantiates the above paragraph, in terms of the nature of the source, and why those points amongst the huge number of claims made amidst the play and book promotion.</p>
<p>"Glenn Close‚Äôs chillingly accurate portrayal of the borderline personality" - How disappointing that the professionals on this programme did not challenge this pathetic and harmful statement by the presenter.

<dd>I myself could attest to attempted murder and kidnapping children as not unknown, though not specifically, borderline behavior (could, if not legally bound not to).

<dd>From my personal patient files, I've got a diagnosed BP who shot the neighbors dog (between the eyes, in front of the kids) for barking; another who killed his girlfriend's cat because she "wasn't in the mood"; I do have flushed goldfish, not boiled; unprovoked assaults; stalking; attempted murder with a motor vehicle; backing over the SO's children with a car (none were hurt, physically); slashed tires; planted child porn at work...the list goes on. In addition, I have had a one female BP patient who makes Glenn Close's "chillingly accurate portrayal" look like storytime. These, however, are all protraits of the violent BP. The demure BP is a whole other ballgame, and no where near as destructive to others -- they just destroy themselves. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadhaka_6829.html" title="User:Sadhaka">Sadhaka</a> 18:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Perhaps to try and make this less polarized, I could suggest it is as much the wording of that paragraph as some of what it is trying to get across. I don't wish to deny that some of it may partially relate to some accepted evidence applicable to some of the many varied and individual people meeting criteria for BPD at some time (usually young women, following abuse or trauma during childhood).</p>
<p>'Individuals meeting criteria for BPD vary in the level at which they are perceived to function socially or occupationally. High functioning may involve greater than usual willingness and ability to adapt to others, in order to achieve acceptance, intimacy or perceived safety. This often appears unsustainable, however, such that stress and emotional turmoil may increase to a point that some or all involved cannot manage or do not accept, and the relationship may end. The individual with a diagnosis of BPD may no longer see the other person in the previously idealised way, and may affirm their own value and worth."</p>
<p>I'm not trying to say this is perfect or necessarily supported by proper citations or whatever, but trying to be clear about what I'm objecting to. I don't think Wikipedia should be making sweeping statements demeaning millions of people as that original paragraph does. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 09:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. I didn't write the paragraph in question, but I'm the one who found citations supporting it and therefore restored the text after deletion. It is in in no way my goal to portray those with BPD negatively, but it's also not my goal to whitewash the facts. I think the paragraph as it stands is fair and accurate, and frankly, I'm not quite sure what you object to. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 16:37, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I just want to say I have no desire to paint over, just to defend against what I feel would seem more like prejudice in other settings, as someone else now seems to have done below. To Sadhaka's comments above, which were posted after my text after it, I would just say that of course I don't dispute that incidents like this occur in relation to BPD, but personally selected case study anecdotes aren't a good foundation for labels and stereotypes, which if to be used at all (rather than only mentioned as a usage by some) surely require comprehensive balanced statistics, and research properly addressing the parties involved, the personal and social context, and distinguishing causes and correlates. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 13:45, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><small>*The use of high-functioning and low functioning here is inaccurate. What the nominclature of hi/lo function refers to is the <a href="../../../g/a/f/GAF_60bd.html" title="GAF">Global Assessment of Functioning</a> as outlined in the DSM.

</dl>
<p><i>High functioning bordelines are often perceived as being extremely charming and even exotic.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>*This is not a perception, but a consistent character profile. Further, low functioning BPs can be quite the same. POV, me thinks. At the least, gross generalization.</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd><small>*Not a shred of clinical reality here. Anecdotal, yes. Clinical, no. Primarily because, in addition to BPs, you are talking about Bi-Ps, grandiose MDs, (not medical doctors), co-dependent characters, counter-dependent characters, narcisstic passive-aggressives, and even demure sociopaths, etc. This, again, is a gross generalization, and one that might be considered a bit more than slightly non-PC by the spiritualists, mystics, religious, and pagans in the readership. Oh, and I note, "speculated"!!!</small></dd>

<dd>As a "High-Functioning Borderline woman" I have lived this behavior, and this behavior has caused the said effects.

<p>As I see it, we have two options. We could continue to play hot potato and nothing will change. Or we could work together in here to figure out what that part of the article would look like. I suggest the latter.</p>
<p>I noticed that you included the following comment: "This is not a perception, but a consistent character profile." Ok, fair enough. How exactly would you characterize this aspect of the BP character profile (without devolving "into POV, sexist, and just plain chauvanistic locker room BS"? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 18:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re: your query...BPs have really, really, really, <i>really</i> lousy boundaries. What happens is, this aspect of character, combined with the fundamental need to be loved and looked after that we all carry around, often creates a perception on our part (that'd be the nonBP, by the way) that the BP is "the most amazing person I've ever met", "the most incredible lover I've ever encountered", "the smartest business partner one could hope for", "the best..." at everything. It's a mind job created and perpetuated by our own fundamental human frailties. The BP overwhelms you with his/her personality, emotional availability, sexual intensity, etc., and, by the time you figure out that you're up to your armpits in quicksand, s/he's standing on the bank going, "Don't look at <i>me</i> -- it's <i>your</i> fault that you got into this mess!" --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadhaka_6829.html" title="User:Sadhaka">Sadhaka</a> 22:57, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that's a lot of good stuff to work from! Here's a quick first draft of what may wind up as a replacement for the disputed paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a consequence of difficulties in maintaining some social and emotional boundaries, often due to a particularly strong need for reassurance and love, people with BPD can sometimes make seemingly rapid and deep connections with others, marked by mutual admiration. When very open and vulnerable, people with BPD can sometimes overwhelm others, for example due to strong emotions, admiration or sexual intensity. They can also be taken advantage of by others. However, due to the inherent instability of such relationships and unresolved issues for the person with BPD, the person with BPD is prone to reverse a sometimes over-positive view, sometimes due to perceived issues of trust which others can see as slight. This can be experienced as unexpected hostility or betrayal by others, and can also be confusing and painful for the person with BPD.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's a bit overwritten, and I have to be careful not to repeat material already covered in this section. Also, keep in mind that, regardless of any research on my part, my own exposure to BP is second-hand and limited to non-clinical interactions, so if I'm saying anything that's misleading or just plain wrong, please don't hestitate to correct me. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 22:03, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Politically-correct circumlocution of the original controversial bit, with added POV ('first impression', 'unhappy in their...', 'betrayal'). I prefer the directness of the original (which also happens to be 100% correct in my experience) but if it has to be changed, I'd rather it was removed entirely. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalG_1ec4.html" title="User:CalG">CalG</a> 23:34, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not the least bit helpful. The original is out, so we're trying to replace it. Removing it means losing information, and I see no reason to do that. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 20:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally I feel that revised paragraph is going in the right direction. I still feel it prioritises the perspective and hurt of others over those of the person with BPD, perhaps, and some statements are still too sweeping or extreme, when they probably only apply to a proportion or only apply to some extent or in some areas at some times. I don't have specific amendments just now but wanted to support this aim. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 10:06, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are reasonable an helpful comments.</dd>
<dd>I think you're right that the paragraph as it stands is more about how the behavior of borderlines affects others than about the symptoms of BPD from the POV of the person who has it. To some extent, this may not be avoidable, in that it's trying to explain how to recognize BPD through one of its typical consequences. Having said that, you may be right that about changing te perspective a bit to focus more on the borderline. Not sure yet just how to do that, but I'll try again.</dd>
<dd>It might help if you could point out which aspects were too sweeping or extreme so I could tone them down. Like I said, it's a bit overwritten now, so there's definitely room to qualify and limit statements that are overly broad.</dd>

<p>Regarding the bit about childishly snapping due to tension from reflecting someone else, that sounds like speculation.

<p>OK apologies in advance if anyone feels I've jumped the gun on this, but I've replaced the original paragraph with the one we discussed above, with some very minor amendments. Seems to make sense to edit it there rather than here. The only thing is that it now appears to repeat quite a lot of what is already in the article just above it, so I guess they need merging <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 19:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you jumped the gun, but I wasn't around. On the one hand, the version you went with corrects many of the flaws in the draft I offered. On the other, I think it goes too far in its effort to water down the content.</dd>
<dd>I made some fairly minor changes, removing redundancy, tightening up the text and restoring a few key phrases. Still, I'm not happy with it. The whole point of the draft was that it focused on rubber-banding as opposed to mere instability, but now I'm not sure if it has a focus at all. Instead, it has an excess of overlap with the paragraph above it that starts with "People with BPD often".</dd>
<dd>What I'm trying to get at here is that, in addition to stormy long-term relationships, those with BPD sometimes have a tendency to jump head-first into a short-term relationship that quickly explodes. From the perspective of the borderline, a person goes from stranger to best friend to worst enemy, all in the span of months or even weeks.</dd>
<dd>From what I understand, this sort of thing is particularly characteristic of BPD, so it's worth mentioning in the section on symptoms. For that matter, it may even offer insight to those who've been on the receiving end of this situation, though that's not a primary goal.</dd>
<dd>At this point, any further feedback would be welcome. I'm going to consider this paragraph further and see if anything more can be done for it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 10:24, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, sorry again if I did jump the gun, and really I just thought might as well edit it within the page rather than here. I would say again that I do'nt believe in watering down, if things are the case then they are the case, but I did want to work on the balance and focus, and I don't personally disagree with any of what you've just said. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranzio_1989.html" title="User:Franzio">Franzio</a> 16:45, 18 March 2006 (UTC) (escept for possibly the use of phrase 'the borderline' but each to their own)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be very clear, you have nothing to apologize for and I take no offence at your initiative. I also don't think you were intentionally watering down the paragraph; by and large, your changes were positive and I've kept most of them. The use of "the borderline" in the place of phrases like "the person with BPD" was less a matter of psychology than it was English; long phrases get heavy when repeated. I realize, however, that some of the shortening might be offensive, so if you can think of a better way, I'm all for it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 21:29, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merging NonBP</span></h2>
<p>I have just merged the NonBP article. This was discussed before Christmas and no objections were raised. "NonBP" is contentious, agenda driven, as POV as it gets and not-terribly-scientific original research. To borrow from Sadhaka "anecdotally referential, grossly generalized, and, in some cases, downright implausible positionality and misinformation" seems to cover it well!</p>
<p>However NonBP exists, it isn't going away yet, but an article of it's own is far too POV for Wikipedia, so the solution seems to be to merge it here.</p>
<p>It's late, I'm tired, I just merged the existing text for now, and deleted a duplicate link, I don't necessarily like the existing text very much and certainly intend to tweak it over the weekend, and hope others will too --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 00:46, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>NonBP is not so much POV, as it is non-clinical terminology. By moving the nonBP section back to the BP page, it revisits a long-standing Wiki-controversy, not on the topic, but on the placement of the information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, nonBP is poor nominclature (the whole thing should be referred to as counter-Borderline (my POV), in keeping with the colloquial prerogative of counter-Dependent, counter-addiction (aka agency), etc. The term was coined by one source, Stop Walking on Eggshells, and that <i>is</i> original, undocumented "research", so you've got a point. The problem here is that it is a concept that has made its way into the BP population, and its satellite relationships. When a suggestion was made to get rid of the topic altogether, it raised quite the ruckus, as I recall.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The counter-point (hah!) is that Al-Anon and Al-A-Teen, etc. exist for a reason. Just because it's new, doesn't make it illegitimate. And like the agent, or the counter-Dependent, the counter-Borderline, is a real, and demonstrable socio-characterological style. I don't believe that it can't be measured, I suspect it's just that no one has yet taken the time.

<dd>"Worthless Creep" (and synonyms) is "non clinical terminology", in common (and often very valid and therapeutic) useage, but it doesn't have it's own article.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Seriously, you can't validate every *theory* any journo or PR person publishes, on the grounds that some day somebody might do some valid research and discover *A* syndrome afflicting the same population, that will probably have vastly different characteristics to the sensationalist version. One of the (many) reasons we have a psychiatric and academic community is to prevent our psyches being defined by amateurs bent upon playing to the resentments of the accusers and the insecurities of the accused.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Counter Borderline" sounds much better to me too, and when you have researched it, got it accepted by the psychiatric and academic communities, and a few other people write dissertations about it so it isn't original research, it will deserve an article. I am sure there is a "counter syndrome" to most PDs (except perhaps Schizoid? ;o) ) waiting to be identified and defined by disciplined experts. But NonBP, as it stands, and is commonly used, is so biased as a concept as to come close to "incitement to hatred" at times and, to many people, shares the same special relationship with prejudice as another infamous "n" word.</dd>

<dd>Some original research sneaks into Wikipedia under "popular useage" but NOT when the original research is soley populist and sensationalist (think what THAT predecent would do to other articles???).</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My gut feeling is that NonBP doesn't belong on Wikipedia in any form AT ALL. But for now, giving it a mention on the BP page seems like a possible compromise? The other alternative would be to have a NonBP article that also incorporated the opposing point of view in equal measure, which would ALSO have to be "original research". But hey, once you let in one kind you can't block the opposition? Right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Seems to me a more civilised solution, if it has to be mentioned AT ALL, is to just place it alongside the real information? That way (at least when it is at it's best) people seeking definition of NonBP will come to the real information, which, of course, will require a few impartial words on the subject to define the term and explain to them why they have landed there. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 18:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I hope that some valid information exists that can be referenced or included here.

<dd>While I appreciate the effort that's gone into producing this nonBP section, the amount of space spent discussing it implies that it's as vigorously researched and widely supported as the diagnosis of BPD. The other implication is like people with BPD, in addition to being pretty unsympathetically treated in the article, go around spreading dysfunction to others. There's a difference between what Gargoyle wants -- a listing of resources for people who care for those with BPD -- and this whole long POV discussion about nonBPs. You don't see a discussion on the entry about Alzheimers with some long diatribe about how living with someone with dementia can make you feel crazy sometimes.</dd>

<dd>Also, if you get a significant part of your identity from the psychiatric disorder your partner/parent/sibling/ex has, what does that say about your boundaries? As near as I can tell, all of this counter-, trans- etc. business aside, people dealing with someone with BPD are divided into three groups: 1) People who care about a person with BPD but are willing to set boundaries, up to and including ending the relationship, to protect themselves and others. 2) People who want to help or fix a person with BPD, who have convinced themselves that THEY alone have the committment, love, whatever, to make the BPD go away. 3) People who seek out relationships with those whom they perceive as weaker (because of mental illness, a history of abuse, physical problems) in the hopes of exploiting that weakness for their own gain. Or, if you like, healthy people, rescuers and sick bastards.</dd>

<dd>The nonBP websites out there seem to be from disillusioned Group 2 people. Most of these folks are nonprofessionals making a diagnosis in retrospect about an ex, a family member, etc. They talk about people who, in their opinion, "behave like BPs" or "have BP traits." (Hello? All of us have one or two BP traits at some point in our lives!) And if you read their stories, they're not talking about a distressed person who creates chaos and distress in others, they're talking about people (often men, which is another red flag) who ENJOY creating chaos and distress in the lives of others. That's abuse, not mental illness. Moreover, I am struck by the almost compulsive need some of these webhosters have to "diagnose" BPD in fictional characters, celebrities, even people they've never met. Case in point: Helens World of 1000 BPD Resources (or whatever it's called). On her site, she links to another -- "Things My Girlfriend And I Have Fought About" -- and describes it as the funny side of living with someone with BPD. Except that site (run by Mil Millington) is NOT about a woman with BPD (although it is hysterically funny). It's about a man and his girlfriend who live in England and fight about everything. This overidentification (which I think is just another symptom of codependency) is a big reason I think the mention of the concept of nonBPs should be brief, with a few links if necessary. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenniSue_3707.html" title="User:JenniSue">JenniSue</a> 23:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe I should point out WHY I like the section as it stands?</p>
<p>"NonBP", as it currently exists, as an agenda, has about as much credibility with me as the KKK, for remarkably similar reasons. Scratch the surface and there is a lot of bigotry, incitement to hatred and "masterplans for the destruction of real human beings".</p>
<p>I think one of the parts I find most shocking is that the NonBP agenda cunningly twists matters so the BPD (which is most frequently caused by abuse) becomes synonymous with factitious abuse claims. That is a truly cruel artificially created "catch 22" for the abused.</p>
<p>The bottom line, however, is exploitation, NOT of Borderlines (they are, apparently, just objects to be demonised and abused), but of the partners of Borderlines.</p>
<p>For WHATEVER reason (and it's not likely to be 100% healthy) these are drawn from people who are in distress due to their relationship with someone they perceive to have BPD (because they are actively encouraged to self diagnose their partners). Now that distress could have anything in a whole spectrum of origins from "Not getting their own way and WANTING IT BAD" to "being in partial denial that their partner is a stone psychopath", and every shade in between. The NonBP agenda aims to please, and exploit 'em all.</p>
<p>No matter how true, or how much we can prove, we cannot say that on Wikipedia. It's original research. We can't pretend NonBP doesn't exist, because people come looking for it and if they don't find it, sooner or later, set up a seperate article giving it EVEN MORE credibility.</p>
<p>Seems to me, what Sadhaka has done is actually very clever. He has described the only aspect of NonBP that has any valid existance and then gone on to relate it to co-dependency in general. He has give good, solid, objective information for all those "NonBPs" who are in the innocent middle range ie, averagely screwed up people (just like you, me and the dog), who are trying to find a little help and understanding of the difficulties in their particular relationship.</p>
<p>If they listen to Sadhaka, they are going to be just a LITTLE less likely to be drawn into the NonBP agenda, and a LITTLE more likely to be receptive to common sense. That has to be a good thing, and IMHO it's the best you can do whilst retaining objectivity--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 11:15, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most traits exhibited by people with BPD are present in many people without a clinical condition. eg. For Black &amp; White thinking see how most people think about politics or sport! People under stress can behave in all sorts of bizarre regressed ways. The best thing to do is to talk to an expert (i.e. see someone who specializes in this area). Anyway, if milder, the main focus will be on what areas of yuor life or things about you you want to change or improve rather than utilising the category.</dd>
<dd>WRT writing a book, I would think there'd be a few chat groups with people who suffer teh condition who'd be glad to help out. However, be clear about what you need and how you ask - emails can be tricky and alot of this is fairly sensitive.</dd>

<dd>Thanks Cas. I'd love to attend a supporters'/recovery group, to see what it's like for survivors and those struggling with their 'boderline proclivities', for want of a better phrase. My novel though is actually about a man who is in seclusion; given my reading and understanding of BPD, I think it's very likely that people who cut themselves off share many things in common with BPDs and may in fact be BPDs. That doesn't mean that recluses are always BPDs or vice versa, but it's an interesting like that I'm seeking to explore. Unfortunately there isn't much info on seclusion (as far as I can tell) but the BPD stuff I've been reading is fascinating.

<p>Yep, it's about a hermit who also has BPD. He's bordered himself up in his house because he's been so scarred and hurt by the rejection of others; the pain of others' has led him to live entirely alone, and yet he still strongly craves relationships.

<dd>I have thought about it and discussed it a lot. There appears to be some merit in having the "famous people with BPD" section --- in terms of identification of behaviour and traits, let alone making the diagnosis more tolerable for people who have it. At the very least we should have the fictional character in the movies and TV listed as far as I can see. I will do it if no one can sensibly object.

<dd>I think that if a character has actually been diagnosed with BPD -- or if a person him- or herself has claimed to have BPD -- then it should be harmless to put them in a section like this. There should be a line drawn at speculation. So, to comment on what Geelin said, Doug Ferrari would be fine, and Susanna Kaysen would also be perfectly acceptable for that matter. For people like Marilyn Monroe, though, I don't know what the protocol would be normally for what is essentially a rumor (published or not). Include it with a link to that reference, making it clear that it's only been argued? --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Dark_3938.html" title="User:Miss Dark">Miss Dark</a> 19:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Making diagnoses of famous and deceased people, in regards to their personality or personality disorders, is something that we can do, to some extent. If we know enough about the person and what they were like in their relationships, you can make educated guesses. My counsellor told me that when he studied psych at uni, Marilyn M was often used as a classic example of borderline, given what people knew of her.</dd>

<dd>Hitler and Kim Jong-Il (North Korea) would classicly fit the profile of a narcissist and possibly even a paranoid personality. Stalin was paranoid to a tee. I've read quite a few books on Hitler (memoirs of his ministers, biographies, etc) and they all support evidence of a narcissistic personaltiy. So I don't think it's <i>that</i> impossible to look at a person, posthumously, and diagnose their personality. If a doctor can hazard a medical guess as to what disease a person had which caused their death, then we can similarly look at a person (retrospectively) and guess their personality; with historical information like journals, recollections of family and friends, recorded interviews, etc we can make our own conclusions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was thinking today even that King Saul in the Bible may have been manic or even borderline. It's a big stretch, and one that I won't argue too far, but his behaviour and cognitive thinking and affective states all fit that profile. Anyway, they're just my thoughts. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeelin_10ed.html" title="User:Geelin">Geelin</a> 12:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with some of your points, Geelin, but not this one: <i>If a doctor can hazard a medical guess as to what disease a person had which caused their death, then we can similarly look at a person (retrospectively) and guess their personality</i>. A doctor has the authority and training to diagnose a disease; if we as laymen hazard a guess, we're just speculating. I'm just saying I question the appropriateness of putting our guesses on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Dark_3938.html" title="User:Miss Dark">Miss Dark</a> 00:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was watching the movie Downfall last night, about the last 10 days of Adolf Hitler's life. It occured to me that Eva Braun, Hitler's wife, was a Borderline. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeelin_10ed.html" title="User:Geelin">Geelin</a> 12:59, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Geelin. Could have been. I don't know enough about her and her traits and behaviour. I wonder if there is any documentation on that aspect of her. There might be reason to believe that AH suffered from it. (cf. disputed <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler%27s_medical_health_07dc.html" title="Adolf Hitler's medical health">Adolf Hitler's medical health</a>) Then again, it's like medical intern's syndrome. One starts either getting the diseases one is studying in med school, or thinks everyone else has them !

<dd>One thing to remember is the concept of Regression (coined by Anna Freud) which says that people regress and behave more primitively under stress. Thus there are people who may have non-turbulent reltionships and relatively stable lives who, under stress (which can be anything!) exhibit traits of a particular personality type or types. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 20:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Livia Soprano seems to have narcissistic personality disorder, NOT borderline. just because a tv show misrepresents a disorder doesnt mean that wikipedia should condone it. olayak</p>
<p>I totally support having a list of famous people with BPD if they can be verified. (suzanna kaysen, for one.) maybe there should be another list of celebrities who are only suspected of having BPD. I, as someone who has BPD, am seriously offended every time fatal attraction comes up because she clearly has antisocial personality disorder, whether or not she also has BPD. People with BPD are most likely to take their anxiety out on themselves (cutting, anorexia/bulemia, substance abuse) and are highly unlikely to physically harm anyone else. Also BPDs are very sympathetic to animals because of the unconditional love that they recieve from animals and that they dont recieve from people. animals dont abandon them. So BPDs are highly highly unlikely to harm any animal. I realize that she does have BPD, but she also has something else seriously wrong with her. There are many articles out there about the misrepresentation of BPD in Fatal Attraction. I will post one soon. olayak</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I agree with you Olayak. I thoroughly agree.</dd>
<dd>According to the Wikipedia article on Rudolf Hess (Hitler's former deputy), some historians had classified Hess as 'neurotic'. Given the extensive reading I've done on WW2, Hitler, and his ministers, I believe that neurotic is a good description of Hess; in fact, I would go further to say he likely had a mental disorder of some sort that involved delusions. Some believe that explains why he parachuted into Scotland, to negotiate a peace deal with the Allies.</dd>

<dd>Apparently, Hitler's old family friend Ernst 'Putzi' Hanfstaengl gave American psychologists a profile of Hitler's personality during WW2 named "Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler".
