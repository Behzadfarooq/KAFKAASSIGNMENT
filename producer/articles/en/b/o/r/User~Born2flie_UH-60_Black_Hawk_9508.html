<p>The Black Hawk was developed to meet a US Army requirement for a <a href="../../../u/h/-/UH-1_Iroquois_3dd5.html" title="UH-1 Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> replacement in 1972. Three prototypes were constructed, the first (YUH-60) flying in October 1974, and evaluated against a rival (YUH-61) <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing-Vertol_5212.html" title="Boeing-Vertol">Boeing-Vertol</a> design. Though the two final competing designs were both developed to Army specifications, the Sikorsky design was selected over an entry from Boeing-Vertol, and the UH-60A entered service with the US Army in 1979. It would go on to serve as the basis for variants in service with other branches of the US military.</p>

<p>During the past year flight tests were completed on an all-composite, multitubular spar for the AH-1G’s main rotor blade. Simulated tests using a helicopter equipped with an advanced cyclic electrothermal rotor blade system were conducted on the Canadian National Research Council’s Ottawa spray rig, and prototype development was begun on synthetic and operations flight training simulators for the CH-47 cargo helicopter (2B31), the AH-1 attack helicopter (2B33), and the UH-60 utility tactical transport aircraft system (2B38).<a href="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1976/ch10.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1976/ch10.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Thirty-four items or weapons systems are planned for introduction into the ARNG during fiscal year 1984 through fiscal year 1988 under the Army's force modernization program. The number of new systems programmed for introduction include the UH-60 helicopter, the M 1 tank, the M 198 howitzer, air defense weapons, mortars, combat vehicles, and personnel armor systems for ground troops.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1981/ch08.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1981/ch08.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Also being modernized is the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, with extended range and an all-weather capability to improve troop and supply transport and aero-medical evacuation.</p>
<p>One of the more significant and pervasive developments in the American Army's major commitment in Europe during the year was the progress made by the theater in the Army-wide modernization program. U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), began receiving the first UH-60 Black Hawks. <a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1982/ch02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1982/ch02.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Surveys and Investigations Staff of the House Appropriations Committee issued a report in 1983 decrying the UH-60 Black Hawk spare parts problems and alleging it had seriously impaired mission readiness. Mr. Joseph P. Cribbins, chief of the Army's Aviation Logistics Office, countered that aircraft readiness was at its highest level since the Vietnam War and that spare parts shortages for the UH-60 existed only during the early phases of fielding the new weapon. During FY 84, the helicopter had the highest peacetime readiness rates ever attained. The flying hour program will reach its plateau in 1988 and spare parts to support that level of operation are stated to be available in 1986.<a href="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch03.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch03.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The performance and battle worthiness of the UH-60 Black Hawk in the Grenada operation were impressive. For example, one UH-60 successfully completed its mission although the pilot was wounded, the fuel tanks were punctured, most of the control instrumentation was destroyed, and the rotors were damaged. Since FY 84 was the last year of the FY 82-84 multiyear procurement airframe contract, the Army negotiated a follow-on FY 85-87 contract for awarding in October 1984. During FY 84, the Army fielded 154 aircraft: 52 to Germany, 84 to Korea, and 8 to Panama. Black Hawk total production reached 574 by 30 September 1984. Sikorsky Aircraft received approval to maintain a ten-aircraft-per-month delivery rate rather than the eight-per-month rate through FY 85.</p>
<p>The contractor completed the upgrading of the UH-60's corrosion protection to the Navy's SH-60B level and incorporated it into all production deliveries beginning June 1984. The Hover Infrared Suppressor Subsystem completed both development and operational testing during FY 84 and awaited production readiness review in the first quarter of FY 85, with production incorporation planned for February 1987. The FY 84 Defense Appropriations Act directed that the Army integrate and qualify the Hellfire missile system on the UH-60A. As a result, the Army awarded a $7.9 million contract on 21 September 1984. A separate contract for integrated logistics support; producibility, engineering, and planning; and a technical data package will be added to it in FY 85. The Fiber Technology Corporation received a contract in December 1983 to produce a 230-gallon crashworthy external fuel tank for the UH-60A (Army), HH-60A (Air Force), and AH-64 (Army).<a href="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch05.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch05.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>The AMEDD made significant progress in the aeromedical evacuation field as aeromedical evacuation units in Europe and. Korea received the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter ahead of schedule. By the end of calendar year 1984, all units in Panama will also be equipped and CONUS units will receive the Black Hawks beginning in 1985.<a href="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch09.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1984/ch09.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>The Army's new light divisions presented a challenge as to how to provide these maneuver organizations with necessary fire support without unduly weighing them down. A workable solution came in the form of the British Royal Ordnance L119, a 105-mm. light howitzer. Now type-classified as the M119, this weapon will replace the M102 and M101A1 howitzers in light divisions. Early in the fiscal year, the Field Artillery Board at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, completed its test of the M119, whichpassed with some qualifications. The weapon had a tendency to bounce at higher elevations and charges, but this flaw did not affect accuracy of fire. Testers successfully displaced the 4,100-pound howitzer using high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs) and the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. With the M119, light division commanders will have the improved range and performance needed to maintain maneuverability and the ability to strike quickly. The howitzer fires all of the conventional 105-mm. ammunition in the Army's inventory, and will be fielded with rocket-assisted projectiles and dual-purpose improved conventional munitions.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter continued to U.S. Army Forces Command; U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command; U.S. Army, Europe; U.S. Army, Japan; and U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard units. The Black Hawk, which is being fielded to air assault, air cavalry, and aeromedical evacuation organizations, can carry more than twice the UH-1 payload and is capable of transporting an entire eleven-man, fully equipped squad faster and in all weather conditions.</p>
<p>On 12 March 1986, the day after a Black Hawk crash in Elba, Alabama, killed three soldiers, the Army grounded its entire fleet of 698 UH-60A's-the second time in eleven months that the fleet had been grounded because of safety concerns. After the previous grounding order, issued in the spring of 1985, Army investigators found problems in the main rotor hub. The Army subsequently directed the manufacturer to make $6.5 million in repairs and lifted the flight ban in the summer of 1985. On 30 April 1986 the Army lifted the second grounding order, even though total destruction of the aircraft had prevented investigators from determining the cause of the 12 March crash. The investigation did reveal, however, several areas for improvement in the Black Hawk, including repositioning of some of the control switches to afford easier access for pilots during flight. Also, Black Hawk pilots were required to perform more extensive preflight checks and more frequent maintenance checks.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1986/ch04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1986/ch04.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<li>By the end of the fiscal year, for example, the Army expected to have fielded more than one-half of the combat systems initiated in the late 1970s. These included such advanced weapons as the Ml Abrams tank, the M2/M3 Bradley fighting vehicle (BFV), the Stinger missile, the UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, and the multiple launch rocket system (MLRS).<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch01.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During this year the U.S. Army continued modernizing and equipping its forces with the weapons systems designed to provide a qualitative edge over the Soviet threats. The current Army modernization effort began about fifteen years ago in response to Soviet development and deployment of new weapons systems. The rate of the Soviet effort indicated their intention to establish numerical superiority in modern battlefield weaponry over the United States and its NATO allies. Throughout the mid-1970x, Soviet forces and their Warsaw Pact allies held a numerical advantage over NATO, although the Pact's equipment remained technologically inferior to that of the western alliance.</li>

<p>To counter this potential threat and to refocus its effort after Vietnam, the U.S. Army embarked on an ambitious program to modernize five aging weapons systems that it identified as crucial to battlefield success. The results are the M1 Abrams tank, as replacement for the M60 tank; the M2 and M3 BFVs which will eventually displace the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC); the AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk attack helicopters to replace the AH-1G and the UH-1H helicopters, respectively; and the Patriot surface-to-air missile system which replaced the Nike-Hercules and will eventually displace the Hawk missile system. Development and fielding of these weapon systems and their complementary technology progressed in FY 1987.</p>
<p>Among the Army's major design projects for the next century is the Light Helicopter Family (LHX), the Army's general rotocraft. The LHX will replace the current fleet of some 7,000 aging (Vietnam vintage) AH-1, UH-1, OH-58, and OH-6 helicopters, which were becoming expensive to maintain and repair. The LHX design will consist of two basic configurations in the 8,000-pound class-a scout/attack (SCAT) and a transport/utility (UTIL) design-to replace and or complement the UH-1, AH-1, OH-58, OH-6A and OH-64A Apache, and the UH-60.</p>
<p>The LHX also will have a minimum cruise speed of 170 knots and possess the ability to climb vertically at a rate of 500 feet per minute even in inclement weather. Except for its minimum dash speed of 160 knots, the assault aircraft will have the same capabilities as the SCAT. The assault version is scheduled to carry eight fully equipped combat troops, plus internal and external cargo.</p>
<p>This year the Army has continued modernization of the various combat and combat support systems necessary to achieve its goal of assembling, moving, and positioning the reserves for commitment to the battle at the proper time and place. The 20,250-pound Black Hawk can carry its three-man crew plus eleven fully equipped combat troops or an equally heavy cargo load into most geographical environments. Recent improvements to the Black Hawk enhance overall mobility; for example, the helicopter can reposition a 105-mm. howitzer, its six-man crew, and thirty rounds of ammunition in a single mission. Critical components and systems are armored so that the helicopter can withstand multiple small arms hits while performing its mission. The airframe is designed to deform gradually, not burst apart on impact. This affords the crew better protection in a crash. Eventually the Black Hawk will replace the UH-1 Huey and shoulder its air assault, air cavalry, and aero-medical evacuation missions. The Black Hawk has been employed successfully under demanding tactical conditions in field exercises and was used extensively in combat in Grenada. The Army has fielded Black Hawks to units within CONUS, Korea, Panama, Europe, and the U.S. Army Western Command (WESTCOM). At present the Army is delivering Black Hawks to the ARNG and USAR units and to the U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), and FORSCOM. This year the Army purchased seventy-eight Black Hawks.<a href="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch05.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch05.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>

<li>The Army continued to cooperate with national and international agencies to support U.S. drug interdiction efforts. In South and Central America, the United States extended its efforts to prevent drug traffickers from reaching the U.S. by committing approximately 150 U.S. Army personnel, including support personnel and six UH-60 helicopters, to Bolivia on 14 July 1986. Support for the Bolivian effort came from the USSOUTHCOM in Panama at the invitation of the Bolivian government and the behest of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The troops were expected to remain in Bolivia until 15 November 1986. The mission of these troops was to eradicate major cocaine production areas by fighting defoliation and transporting Bolivian Army troops to the northern and central parts of Bolivia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legislation authorizing DOD to support the drug interdiction effort became effective on 27 October 1986 under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. The act authorized $40 million for use in purchasing eight UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to be loaned to U.S. Customs. Of the amount appropriated, $18 million was used to provide four helicopters for this purpose. While implications of the statute are still evolving under the guidance of its lead agency, JCS, the law requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a list of additional assistance and a plan for lending appropriate equipment by 27 January 1987. The Secretary of Defense's list of support areas will include surveillance, reserve components, communications, intelligence, aviation, marine vessels, and land vehicles. Input to the Secretary of Defense's supported agencies will identify specific requirements, equipment availability, and readiness impacts that cannot be determined without this assistance. The report will demonstrate the cost of sealing U.S. borders to drugs in terms of its impact on readiness.</p>
<p>During this fiscal year, aviation elements of the Army continued to support Operation Bahamas (OPBAT) and Turks/Caicos Islands on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week basis. OPBAT was initiated in 1982 when the Royal Bahamian Police Force requested assistance from the U.S. Government to stem the flow of drugs through the Bahamas. The operations consist of the Royal Bahamian Police Force, DEA, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and Turks and Caicos Islands Police with transportation assistance from U.S. Army UH-60 helicopters. The mission requires that these helicopters be furnished overwater equipment. DEA and Coast Guard personnel directed the OPBAT helicopter operations and coordinated all other interdiction operations in the Bahamas from the U.S. embassy in Nassau.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch08.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1987/ch08.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>Joint Army/Air Force Initiative 17, 22 May 1984, transferred responsibility for Special Operations Forces (SOF) rotary wing airlift support from the Air Force to the Army. The Deputy Secretary of Defense supports a program for fifty-one MH-47E (modified CH-47D Chinook) and twenty-three MH-60K (modified UH-60A Black Hawk ) helicopters with improved capability in adverse weather and difficult terrain, altered for in-flight refueling, and equipped with infrared radar, a more powerful engine, and advanced communications.<a href="http://www.army.mil/Cmh-Pg/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH11.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/Cmh-Pg/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH11.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Significant features of the aircraft include a fully integrated cockpit, more powerful engines, forward-looking infrared, terrain following/avoidance radar, air-to-air refueling, and Stinger air-to-air missiles.

<p>A detachment of four specially equipped UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters is assigned to each Special Forces group. The Army planned to eliminate these detachments from all SF groups by FY 1991 and to make the groups totally dependent on theater army general support aviation and Air Force resources. Army SOFs are also supported by Air Force helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The feasibility of transferring the entire special operations airlift mission to the Army was examined but rejected by a DOD study in late FY 1988.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 13 May 1989, violent winds in excess of 100 miles per hour damaged or destroyed 142 of the 495 aircraft at Fort Hood Army Airfield and nearby Robert Gray Army Airfield. The III Corps' fleet of 150 AH-64s, one-third of the Army's Apache inventory, was hit the hardest. Apaches from the 1st Cavalry Division, the 2d Armored Division, the 6th Cavalry Brigade (the Army's only separate air combat brigade), and the Apache Training Brigade were damaged. Of the 101 Apaches damaged, 31 needed depot repairs. Thirty to forty other helicopters (UH-60s, OH-58s, UH-1s, CH-47s, and AH-1s) were severely damaged. Most of the helicopters suffered damage to the main rotor blades, structural faults, and damage to transmissions. Losses were initially estimated in excess of $600 million, which included facilities repair. A second severe storm in early June damaged about fifty helicopters at Fort Polk, Louisiana, with losses there estimated at $9 million.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH5.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>

<li>Following the outbreak of widespread fires in Yellowstone National Park in the summer of 1988, some twenty-four hundred Army troops from the 9th Infantry Division (Motorized), Fort Lewis, Washington, assisted local, state, and national authorities in controlling the fires. Approximately eighteen hundred additional soldiers from the 9th were dispatched in mid-September to squelch fires in Canyon Creek, north of Helena, Montana. Participating Army personnel, about five thousand, were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal (HSM). When forest fires erupted in many western states in the summer of 1989, Army units again were assigned to fire-fighting duties. Troops from Forts Carson, Campbell, Lewis, Polk, and Riley battled fires and performed mop-up operations in the Payette and Boise National Forests in Idaho. In late July 1989 FORSCOM asked Fort Riley for a 550-man task force composed mainly of the 55th Engineer Company (Medium Girder Bridge) and a command and control element from the 4th Battalion, 37th Armor, that served until 19 August 1989. T h e I Corps, Fort Lewis, Washington, furnished two 500-man battalion task forces of engineer and aviation elements to assist the Boise Interagency Fire Center in the vicinity of <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baker%2C_Oregon_ce14.html" title="Baker, Oregon">Baker, Oregon</a>, for about a week.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Army furnished a number of helicopters to provide mobility and medical evacuation. Aviation units that deployed came under the operational control of Sixth US Army, Presidio of San Francisco, California, and were detailed to the Boise Interagency Fire Center. The major aviation force came from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and consisted of 16 UH-60 Black Hawk and 3 UH-1 Huey helicopters with 160 crew members and support personnel. The UH-60s self-deployed, but the UH-1s were ferried aboard an Air Force C-5 transport. Redeployment was carried out in the same manner at the end of August. Smaller detachments were sent from Fort Carson (3 UH-1s for command and control), from Fort Lewis (3 UH-60s and 2 UH-1s for medical evacuation), and from Fort Polk (3 UH-60s for medical evacuation). []</p>
<ul>
<li>The UH-60 Black Hawk was being modified to the MH-60K with improved capability in adverse weather and difficult terrain, altered for in-flight refueling, and equipped with infrared radar, a more powerful engine, and advanced communications. The Army planned to procure twenty-three modified MH-60Ks. The Army was also developing a new version of the medium-lift CH-47 Chinook, the MH-47E, for special operations. In FY 1989 the Army upgraded many of its older Chinooks. The CH-47D was receiving new fiberglass rotor blades and a stronger drive system. The Army planned to refurbish 144 Chinooks. The Special Operations Aviation Program called for modifying 17 MH-47Es, 23 MH-60Ks, and 2 Combat Mission Simulators in its first phase. Other modified Chinooks and Black Hawks would be acquired in Phase Two. The heart of special operations aircraft modernization was the Integrated Avionics Subsystem (IAS). It provided advanced navigation systems that allowed special operations helicopters to maneuver at night and under severe terrain and weather conditions. Tests of IAS hardware and software were completed in February 1989.<a href="http://www.army.mil/Cmh-Pg/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH11.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/Cmh-Pg/books/DAHSUM/1989/CH11.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>

<p>Army aviation benefited from the procurement of fifty-two Black Hawk UH–60 utility helicopters.</p>
<p>In FY 1993 Congress directed the Secretary of the Army, in coordination with the Chief, National Guard Bureau, to identify the specific components of a UH–1 Huey Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). During the fiscal year the Army position was to procure new UH–60s in concert with the Army's modernization plan, which includes a strategy to replace older, more technologically obsolete aircraft with fewer but more capable systems. The Army's ultimate goal is to reduce the number, types, and models of rotary-wing aircraft, thereby cutting operating and support costs while maintaining an equivalent war-fighting capability. The objective is a rotary fleet consisting of the RAH–66 (for armed reconnaissance), AH–64 (attack), UH–60 (combat support), and CH–47 (combat service support). The ARNG supported an initiative for a SLEP UH–1 to perform the mission of a light utility helicopter until a new one was identified. The Army, however, did not believe that there was a proper requirement and opposed a UH–1 SLEP. The Army study on whether a UH–1 SLEP is required is expected to be completed by July 1994.</p>
<p>Several issues required resolution before ARI could be fully implemented. The TOEs for the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) companies and their parent battalions were slowly being developed and documented. The ARI plan as submitted to HQDA consolidated all UH–60s into a General Support Aviation Battalion, but ODCSLOG's Aviation Logistics Divison did not support the consolidation and wanted the utility aircraft restored to the AVIM companies (each AVIM company was authorized two UH–1Hs or UH–60s). MACOMs also expressed their desire to retain some displaced equipment, such as aviation special tools and test equipment, until all ARI requirements are documented.</p>
<p>During the fiscal year the Army continued the Refurbishment/Standardization (R/S) Program, which repaired and restored 300 of the oldest UH–60 helicopters to Army standards prior to redistributing them to Army Reserve and Army National Guard units. The Army expected to procure 300 UH–60Ls as part of the FY 1992–96 production buy. The R/S Program takes aircraft produced between 1977 and 1982 and standardizes the various modifications to the 1989 configuration. The older UH–60As marked for the R/S Program came out of "first to fight" priority units as the newer UH–60Ls began fielding. The program calls for sixty-eight aircraft to complete the program each year at Corpus Christi Army Depot in Texas and National Guard Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depots (AVCRAD) at Fresno, California, and Groton, Connecticut. The R/S Program calls for the Corpus Christi depot to receive five aircraft into the program each month (sixty per year) and each of the AVCRADs to receive four per year. Refurbishment includes a 500-hour phase airframe inspection, preventive maintenance, and replacement of all "time between overhaul" (TBO) items that have less than 500 service hours remaining. Standardization involves the application of more than thirty modifications and engineering changes. The first aircraft is scheduled to be refurbished in December 1993, and at least fifteen are expected to be completed by mid-1994. The average repair cycle time is projected to be approximately six months, and the average cost per aircraft refurbishment is calculated at $1.536 million. The Army hopes to complete the refurbishment and standardization by FY 1997, barring significant cuts in depot maintenance funding.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1993/ch07.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/DAHSUM/1993/ch07.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>

The aircraft belonged to the 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) of the 56th Medical Battalion (Evacuation), which was part of the 55th Medical Group of the 44th Medical Brigade. The "1st up" aircraft arrived at Pope Air Force Base at 1438, eight minutes after notification, and departed for Womack with two litter cases at 1448. The "2d up" aircraft touched down at 1440 but did not evacuate any casualties. Six other medevac helicopters, belonging to the 57th Medical Company, stood by at Womack and at nearby Simmons Army Airfield for transfer of casualties from Womack to other facilities.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/green-ramp/pope1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/green-ramp/pope1.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>

<p>In the grassy area outside the emergency room, a sheet marked AIREVAC designated the place where patients were being readied for transfer by helicopter to regional hospitals. The 57th Medical Company, which was on a field exercise nearby when the accident occurred' had five helicopters on the pad at Womack and three at nearby Simmons Army Airfield ``ready to go." Major Corey arranged for four UH-60s to take seven soldiers who required immediate burn treatment to the Jaycee Burn Center at Chapel Hill; a physician and a respiratory therapist accompanied each patient. At 2330 a helicopter transferred a soldier with an open spinal wound to the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Virginia.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/green-ramp/pope2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/green-ramp/pope2.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

<p>On 14 April 1994, two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters transporting personnel participating in Operation PROVIDE COMFORT were accidentally shot down over northern Iraq by two U.S. Air Force F-15 air­craft. Based on the results of the subsequent investigation, the Secretary of Defense initiated a series of corrective actions that applied lessons learned. Corrective actions within the doctrinal arena focused on a thorough review of extant joint and service doctrine and the accelerated development and promulgation of joint procedures to ensure that such an accident would not recur. Based on a decision by the CJCS, the Army implemented doctrinal changes in July 1994 that were formalized in the accelerated publication of Joint Publication (JP) 3-56.1, Command and Control for Joint Air Operations, in November 1994. JP 3-56.1 enhanced existing guidance in JP 3-52, Doctrine for Joint Airspace Control in the Combat Zone, and included specific guidance that addressed command and control procedures during military operations other than war. Under the new guidance, Army rotary-wing aircraft had to operate on air tasking orders or flight plans to provide positive control in highly volatile situations. Under normal conditions, Army rotary-wing aircraft using established air­space procedures continued to operate under the control of the land force commander.<a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/DAHSUM/1994/ch04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/DAHSUM/1994/ch04.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>

<li>In FY 1994 security assistance support in Asia went to Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Taiwan received DOD approval to purchase the Avenger Pedestal-Mounted Stinger System antiaircraft missile, the Chaparral MIM-72J missile, and the Armored Gun System (AGS). Taiwan took delivery of sixteen of twenty-six OH-58D armed scout helicopters that it had already purchased. Taiwan also signed a commercial contract with the Raytheon Company for the Modified Air Defense System. An amendment to Japan's Black Hawk/Sea Hawk memorandum of understanding authorized production of additional UH-60 helicopters in Japan.</li>

<li>The Army resolved a record contract fraud case during the fiscal year. On 30 March the service reached a settlement in a whistleblower suit with United Technologies Corporation (Sikorsky Aircraft Division) that required United Technologies Corporation to pay the Army $150 million, the largest sum ever recovered in a whistleblower case and for an Army contract fraud case. More than $132 million of the recovery derived from false claims on Army contracts. The Army suffered damage when United Technologies Corporation overstated charges on work progress payment requests. The majority of contracts in the suit involved UH-60 Black Hawk and SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters. The United Technologies Corporation settlement accounted for a substantial portion of the $202.4 million total recovered by the Army for procurement fraud in FY 1994.
