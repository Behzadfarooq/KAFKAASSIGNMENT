<p>The Borah mascot is the <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion.html" title="Lion">lion</a>, and the school's slogan is "The Lions of Idaho," a play on the nickname of namesake <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_E._Borah_9c94.html" title="William E. Borah">William E. Borah</a>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senator</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">40</a>. Borah was known in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> as the "Lion of Idaho" for his outspoken stance on a variety of issues. During the school's first year (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">59</a>), the Boise daily newspaper <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho_Statesman_023b.html" title="Idaho Statesman"><i>The Idaho Statesman</i></a> often referred to the Borah's athletic teams as the "Senators." A <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> school newspaper article noted that Borah's original students did not particularly like the unofficial nickname, and later adopted the lion as the official mascot. The <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_colors.html" title="School colors">school colors</a> of Borah High School are <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a> &amp; <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>.</p>

<p>The school sits on a sprawling campus, with five permanent buildings, connected by an outdoor "breezeway". The original campus of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> featured three structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main classroom building, with a designated hall for each of the three grade levels, <a href="../../../c/a/f/Cafeteria.html" title="Cafeteria">cafeteria</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a>, main office, <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditorium.html" title="Auditorium">auditorium</a>, and other assorted features;</li>
<li>The "Math Hall" building, housing <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> classes and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_arts.html" title="Industrial arts">industrial arts</a> shops;</li>
<li>The "Old Gym," containing the original gym, locker rooms, weight rooms, gymnastics/wrestling room, and athletic department offices. It also included rooms used for band, orchestra, choir, and publications (newspaper &amp; yearbook). The basement weight room was originally constructed as an ROTC indoor firing range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additions in the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"New Gym," a larger gymnasium was added to the campus in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> at the south end of the area known as the "U," a driveway entrance (and exit) from Cassia Street that originally surrounded a football/soccer field. It is currently under construction.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> a larger auditorium was constructed on the west end of campus, between the original gymnasium and the running track, south of the tennis courts.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borah_High_School_e34f.html" title="Edit section: Outdoor athletic facilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Outdoor athletic facilities</span></h2>
<p>On-campus outdoor athletic facilities include the baseball stadium, Bill Wigle Field, (former home field for <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_University_efc1.html" title="Boise State University">Boise State University</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, as well as the Class A Boise A's (1975-76), independent Boise Buckskins (1978), and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_Hawks_8a8a.html" title="Boise Hawks">Boise Hawks</a> (1987-88) minor league teams of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_League_a82d.html" title="Northwest League">Northwest League</a>), and an indoor batting cage. Bill Wigle Field is named for the longtime varsity <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> coach who won state championships in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, and stepped down following the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> season. Before 1983, the field was known as "Borah Field." After a 24 year drought, the Borah baseball team won the state championship in 2005. Outdoor batting cages were constructed in 1980, and indoor cages added in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. The baseball facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.</p>
<p>At the northwest corner of campus is a synthetic-rubber 400 meter (437.4 yard) running track, with a practice field in its infield. Between the baseball stadium and running track are several other fields used for athletic team practices, physical education classes, and other extra-curricular activities. The southern border of campus is defined by an irrigation canal, the Farmers Lateral Canal, cut out of the base of the second Boise bench. The tennis courts are just east of the running track, on the the north edge of campus.</p>
<p>Like the other public high schools in Boise (and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada_County_4386.html" title="Ada County">Ada County</a>), Borah's varsity <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> team does not play its home games on campus, rather on the blue synthetic turf of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronco_Stadium_4710.html" title="Bronco Stadium">Bronco Stadium</a> of <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_University_efc1.html" title="Boise State University">Boise State University</a>, four miles to the east.</p>

<li><i>Football</i></li>
</ul>
<p>From its inception in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> to the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Borah was the dominant football program in the state. Borah's first head coach was <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Troxel_91bd.html" title="Ed Troxel">Ed Troxel</a>, who was previously head coach at the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertson_College_of_Idaho_18bd.html" title="Albertson College of Idaho">College of Idaho</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caldwell%2C_Idaho_3879.html" title="Caldwell, Idaho">Caldwell</a>. In Troxel's nine seasons at Borah (1958-66), he compiled a record of 78-6-2 (.918), winning the Southern Idaho Conference (SIC) and unofficial state title (writer's poll) 8 times; finishing as state runner-up the other year. Troxel left Borah in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> to become an assistant coach at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Idaho_35ed.html" title="University of Idaho">University of Idaho</a>, and its head coach in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>De Pankratz, an assistant under Troxel, took over as head coach in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> with continued success, and compiled additional SIC and state titles. A state playoff system was finally introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> to determine an official state champion, via an 8-team tournament (3 rounds). Borah advanced to the A-1 state finals in each of the first three years, playing cross-town rival <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_High_School_88d5.html" title="Boise High School">Boise High</a> each year (Class "A-1" became "5A" in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>).</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, the once-defeated Borah Lions decisively won 38-0 to grab the first official state title, and finished with a record of 11-1. Their only defeat was in the fifth game of the season to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_High_School_%28Idaho%29_e3c9.html" title="Capital High School (Idaho)">Capital</a> 28-27, which snapped a 14-game winning streak. Borah had outscored its first four opponents 161-9. Borah then won the last four games of the regular season 167-41. After a closer-than-expected win (by 15 points) in the quarterfinals over <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_High_School_%28Pocatello%2C_Idaho%29_0fa9.html" title="Highland High School (Pocatello, Idaho)">Highland</a> (of <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocatello%2C_Idaho_8bcf.html" title="Pocatello, Idaho">Pocatello</a>), Borah shut out <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewiston%2C_Idaho_b690.html" title="Lewiston, Idaho">Lewiston</a> 42-0 in the semifinals, and Boise 38-0 in the finals. The 1979 Lions were led by the backfield of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">QB</a> Lance Dunne and running backs Randy Holmes and Darren Corpus.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> the twice-defeated Lions lost the state title game on a close play at the goal line as time ran out, and finished the season at 9-3. Borah had avenged their regular season loss (14-16) against <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_High_School_%28Idaho%29_e3c9.html" title="Capital High School (Idaho)">Capital</a> in the state semifinals with a 27-19 victory, but narrowly lost to <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_High_School_88d5.html" title="Boise High School">Boise High</a> for the second time in the 1980 season. In the regular season the Lions had wins over two powerful out-of-state teams: <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medford%2C_Oregon_4a83.html" title="Medford, Oregon">Medford, Oregon</a> away and <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinole%2C_California_70d8.html" title="Pinole, California">Pinole Valley, California</a> at home in Boise. The 1980 Lions were led by <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">QB</a> John Day.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, undefeated Borah easily won the state title, defeating the <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_High_School_88d5.html" title="Boise High School">Boise Braves</a> 30-13 in the Lions' closest game of the year (17 points). (In the regular season Borah had shutout Boise 27-0.) Pankratz's dominating <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> team handily beat the same two powerful out-of-state programs: <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medford%2C_Oregon_4a83.html" title="Medford, Oregon">Medford, Oregon</a> 36-6 at home and <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinole%2C_California_70d8.html" title="Pinole, California">Pinole Valley, California</a> 27-8 away, and compiled a perfect 12-0 record, with two shutouts. The Lions were unchallenged all season, winning by an average score of 37-9, earning a national top-20 ranking in multiple publications. The 1981 Lions were led by the backfield of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southpaw.html" title="Southpaw">southpaw</a> <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">QB</a> Bob Wheeler and running backs Mark Tidd and Greg Harrison.</p>
<p>Four months later, the Borah varsity <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> team would also win the state title, as would the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">track &amp; field</a> team in May (the second of four straight), for a rare triple state title for the class of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. (The Borah <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> team finished fifth in state in 1982, after taking first in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, a state title led by seniors Greg Hunnicutt, Jim Rice, Daryl Zarbnisky, Bert Thompson and John Day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Borah football program has not been as successful in recent years, and the 1981 state title is its most recent on the gridiron.</p>
