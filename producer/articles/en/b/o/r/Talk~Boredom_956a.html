<p>I just wanted to point out that there's a "see also" link to Ennui, which redirects to Boredom....I don't want to remove it myself because a) I'm not really an participating member of the community and b) it really made me smile. But someone might want to fix that.</p>
<p>I want to second that. I wouldn't consider Ennui to be translated as boredom. To me, Ennui connotes a more complex idea. Ennui is closer to melancholy than boredom.</p>

<p>Ennui is <i>not</i> just boredom. Ennui is a malaise that's created by a sense of meaninglessness in the world; someone is said to suffer from Ennui if they question the use of any action in the world. The typical statement to connote ennui is "What's the point of it all?" You can be bored and not be suffering from ennui. Boredom by itself may mean simply not having anything to do, or being tired of the available options. Ennui suggests a larger existential crisis. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreddie_deBoer_a9ce.html" title="User:Freddie deBoer">Freddie deBoer</a> 18:57, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fully agree. Boredom is to temporary depression (feeling "blue" for an hour or a day) as Ennui is to long-term/clinical depression. The two are not synonymous. I'm changing it.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a paper on boredom. I agree that boredom is a very important philosophical topic especially since much of normal lives consists of periods of time marked by inactivity (where inactivity is defined as moments that we do not take distinct note of). This article does go some analysis of the concept of boredom but i believe there is a whole lot more that can be expanded upon in this article. So much of our culture in this generation and the last has resulted from the sheer lack of stimuli. You might even be able to go so far as to say that all of our life we are trying to avert boredom by finding activities, causes, hobbies etc. that allow us to consume ourselves in what otherwise be a quite mundane and primitive existence. I figure I might as well contribute at some point as well if I have the time and research opportunity.</p>

<p>It says "Those afflicted with temporary boredom may regard the affliction as a waste of time, but usually characterize boredom as far worse." Is it just me or does that sentence say that boredom is bad but boredom is worse?</p>
<p>This makes no sense to me so I deleted it. I think a lot of the stuff was nonsense or was actually not true once I deciphered it. <a href="../../../c/a/z/User%7ECazort_41d4.html" title="User:Cazort">Cazort</a> 00:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I kind of like this article, but I feel that it rambles. Hence, I created the "causes" section. I think a lot of other stuff could be put into this section...made into a more coherent discussion instead of just a rambling narrative? But I don't want to be quick to butcher up everyone else's contributions...</p>
<p>I feel like this article is already shifting...it seems to be started as a goofy, fun article. But it's not really--boredom is a serious issue, and people have actually studied it! It's a symptom of some of the deep underlying problems in American society!
