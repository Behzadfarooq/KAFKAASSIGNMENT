<p>Can I ask what specifically is wrong with the tone of the article? It's hard to fix if you don't say what's wrong with it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 20:15, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah yeah. I meant to get to that, but was at work, with too little time to effectively edit the text and got distracted before I could comment. Reading the article, it felt that it was a bit off in the way some of the events were phrased. Some of the statements were a too "intimate" (for lack of a better word) or were made with information that ought to have been provided in the article. Case in point for both of those qualities is the statement: <i>At this point Manuel had about 25 000 men, although he may have had as many as 50 000.</i> It would be more appropriate to say something along the lines of: "Manuel had an army that has been reported at being anywhere from 25k to 50k men."</p>
<p>Also, things like "Manuel gathered an army, supposedly so large that it spread across ten miles" and "Both routes lay on a heavily wooded route, where the Turks could easily hide and set up ambushes; the army moving towards Amasia was destroyed in one such ambush, and Turkish envoys brought Manuel Andronicus' head" are informative, yes, but they are poorly worded with regard to what you are trying to get across. For the latter, I think that the weakness is in the section after the semicolon. Better to make it into two separate sentences. One saying that the army led by Andronicus was destroyed by ambush. The second saying that Andronicus was slain and that his head was sent to Manuel. And saying "brought Manuel Andronicus' head" was confusing to read because "Manuel Andronicus" reads as if it is a single name. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 21:52, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yea, that "when you have time" part is the big kicker. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 13:06, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with any Alpha Phi Omega chapter which uses the latin letters AFW for their group. As far as I can tell, the only standard use of AFW to refer to the fraternity is simply that the standard Windows Word Symbols Font uses those letters to generate the greek letters Alpha Phi Omega. Please respond to let me know which chapters use that publicly.</p>

<p>I don't know of any chapters as a whole that use it, but I remember at the convention in 2002 that one of the surveys in the daily newsletter was about how people referred to the fraternity. And AFW was one of the choices. Because Phi is an F and Omega is a W, not P and O (Pi and Omicron). <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 07:34, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you that Phi is an F, but Omega and are both "leftovers". They (The people who made the symbols code) had to match up letters in the Roman Alphabet with no greek equivalent with those in the Greek Alphabet that don't have one. Omega is matched with W, mostly because of the shape of the Lower Case Omega, which turns out to be just chance it looks like a w. Some of the other matchups are worse: Q with Theta? And Eta with H is the fact that they look alike in Capital. But Eta is a vowel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Omicron and Omega *both* match with the roman O. Omicron *always* has the short O sound like both Os in the roman writeout of the name of the letter or "cot" where Omega has a long O sound like the O in the name of the letter or Coat. So as long as we keep saying A Phi Ooooh, we *are* abbreviating it correctly.&#160;:)</dd>

<p>I think the key alternate histories of the Civil War ought to be included into the list of related novels. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guns_of_the_South_6e53.html" title="The Guns of the South">The Guns of the South</a> (while probably not the best of the alt-hists, a good one), Turtledove looks at the many different issues about the cause of the war and does so quite well. Simply because he changes the outcome of the war and includes timetraveling south african nazis doesn't mean it is of any less value when reading other fictional stories about the war. Some of the well-known stories don't even deal with the war except as a background for story lines that don't deal with the issues of the war at all. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Red_Badge_of_Courage_b7b1.html" title="The Red Badge of Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a> is a story that could be told in any war, not just the American Civil War. But the topics that HT covers in Guns could only all be covered in a story about the Civil War. What makes Red Badge fit there better than Guns when the latter is much more relevant to THE war itself as opposed to war in general? -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornyesterday_68b4.html" title="User:Bornyesterday">Bornyesterday</a> 21:37, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I happen to be a big A-H fan, so I can partially sympathize with your points. But: (1) This article is way too long and I try to resist additions to the booklists, if only because it will inspire other additions and spiral out of control. (2) The focus of this Novels section, which is rather uncommon in Wiki history articles, is to highlight famous works. RBoC is a piece of classic American literature, along with Killer Angels. (Yes, you may quibble with some of the ones in the list, but I'd rather see you delete some than add more.) Turtledove is not classic and mentioning his Guns book to any serious CW person will get you a big laugh. Guns isn't even his most serious A-H of the CW--see <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline-191.html" title="Timeline-191">Timeline-191</a>. I could <b>possibly</b> tolerate one entry of <b>the all-time classic</b> A-H novel, but there isn't one. There are dozens of equally obscure works, some semi-serious analyses, others pure science-fantasy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be legitimate for you to write an article Alternate histories of the American Civil War and point to it in the See Also, but I'd prefer to keep such books out of the main article so they don't proliferate. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 23:12, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
