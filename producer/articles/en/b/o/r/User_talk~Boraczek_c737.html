<dd>No nie wiem czy wybory kontraktowe można uznać za demokratyczne. Prasa zazwyczaj tak je określa, ale jest to raczej skrót myślowy. Tak czy siak - Twoja propozycja wydaje się niezła, po drobnej poprawce zaproponuję ją na stronie dyskusji. Tylko nie wiem czy jest dalej sens dyskutować z facetem (?) który twierdzi, że państwa komunistyczne były bardziej demokratyczne niż demokracje rządzone przez multikorporacje.. Z teorii spiskowych trudno się wyleczyć, a już na pewno nie mam ochoty kogokolwiek od nich odwodzić, za ciężka to praca...

<p>I wish I had a good idea of what to do. An RfC could be started, but they are almost completely ineffective. If any actual measure were ever taken - which it never has been against the armies of sockpuppets who often declared open war on Wikipedia - he would just create yet another account. No, the only option appears to be to fight indefinitely to make it clear he will accomplish nothing with all this revert-warring.

<p>Hello! Have you received the email I sent to U yesterday? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 22:27, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did and replied but after extensive attempt to discuss matters with Shorne I requested mediation which he refused and have now requested arbitration. You may join that request if you wish. I would need for another person to engage in attempts to discuss things with Shorne on his talk page before we could do a request for comment. You can still go ahead and do that if you wish, but probably better to add evidence to the arbitration case now. However, keep in mind that it can backfire and you yourself can be accused of edit warring, etc. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 22:33, Oct 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arbitration cases take several months, expecially if I have recused myself. There will be plenty of time to consider evidence if the case is accepted. If you do add evidence, please be sure to include a link to the actual edit you are refering to so that the arbitrators can easily look at it. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:10, Oct 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>213.56.68.29 is one of many IPs used by Turrican, who no longer uses an account. He added some very questionable material to two of the history article, and I removed it in one case and added a dispute notice on another. As retaliation, he began reverting several random edits of mind, including simple copyedits, as well as vandalizing my user page, including putting a swastika and a wish that I die horribly on it. He has now run this guerrilla campaign for weeks, switching IP addresses periodically and reverting all sorts of edits. I asked the ArbCom to intervene, but they have done nothing - though they're coming after me. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">Very</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">Verily</font></a> 09:18, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

I am currently involved in an edit war with him in this topics: <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzman_df64.html" title="Abimael Guzman">Abimael Guzman</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_Path_bc8e.html" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a>.

<dd>Sometimes I check your contribution list to see if you have devastated some new articles. And if I notice some blatant POV-pushing or unsubstantiated deletions, I restore the original text or NPOVize the article. The statement that I "spitefully revert all of your changes" is far from being true. I never touched many of the articles you edited.

<dd>I don't know if 'stalking' is a proper word, but, since it seems to me that you are a massive POV-pusher, I browsed your contribution list a few times. Is it against any Wikipedia policy or guideline? I think it turned out to be a good idea, because every time I did it, I discovered you had spoiled some new articles.

In his short time on WP, Shorne has matched RK in volume and virulence of insult, and doesn't show any signs of being able to control himself. So, something to keep in mind. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:24, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that I have already asked you repeatedly to stop saying that I have a "similar political orientation" to that of Shorne.

<dl>
<dd>I never asked you on talk pages, but I asked I did so on others. Instead of assuming bad faith, you could've asked me to elaborate on my comments. I wrote those comments on Stan Sheb's page based on his treatment of me, which I'd long found rude and condescending, and thus similar to what Shorne was stating on the talk page. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 18:54, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I maintain you never asked me.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate your impartiality in exercising admin rights (AFAIK you never abuse your powers), but from my point of view your reaction to Stan's complaint cast doubt on your impartiality in judgment on disputes and arbitrator's judgements should not be affected by his past personal conflicts and political differences. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 23:38, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is a difference between making a comment in passing on a talk page, which we are free to do, and exercising admin or arbitrator responsibilities. As a stated on David Vasquez's page, I understand that my own biases surrounding a user must be irrelevant to my understanding of what a user has the capacity to offer our community if I am serving on the committee. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:David_Vasquez#Your_questions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:David_Vasquez#Your_questions" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Thus, I can respect Stan as a valued contributor, although he is certainly not one of the users with whom I enjoy interacting. In the event that I could not see beyond past personal conflicts as an arbitrator, I would just recuse myself from the case. Keep in mind that this is not uncommon. Some of the current members of the Arbitration Committee recuse themselves all the time. Fred Bauder, e.g., recuses himself all the time, particularly from the cases involving Shorne. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:08, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What you say is insightful. Still, I don't think your reaction to Stan's complaint was appropriate for an admin and a candidate for the seat in the ArbCom. Your comment created the impression that you encouraged insulting. Well, if my future contacts with you don't give me reason to doubt your ability to transcend your bias, I will come to the conclusion that that was nothing more than a single and casual comment. I will shade my disendorsement a little bit. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:15, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Chaning your comments to 'I think that they share the same political orientation' hardly constitutes 'shading your disendorsement'. The attacks on that page accusing me of advancing a Communist agenda on Wikipedia should be seen as ludicrous by all fair-minded users reasonably informed on Russian and Soviet politics. Perhaps no other user has added more detail to Wikpedia articles demonstrating how the Soviet system empowered informal, illegitimate powers networks in order to run its leading institutions, and how these tendencies inherent in the Soviet system were continued following that system's collapse, thus explaining why market and democratic reform strategies went wrong in Russia, than I have. This can be seen by reading the articles to which I have contributed linked on my user page. I unapologetically admit, though, that the framework through which I write about Russian politics is more subtle and nuanced than to what what many Wiki users are accustomed. However, as an academic I understand that this is the only workable approach, and that it is intellectually and academically inappropriate for an encyclopedia to have articles reading like hysterical Cold War-era anticommunism. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 21:38, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1. Distorting the text I wrote and you quoted does not prove subtlety.</dd>
<dd>2. The rest of your message seems to have nothing to do with my comment. I criticized you for encouraging insults, not for your contribution to articles. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 22:14, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I am complaining about the fact that you left "I suspect that 172 and Shorne share the same political orientation' in your disendorsement statement; your statment still claims that you suspect that I am backing Shorne against Stan Shebs because of political reasons. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:21, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I suspect that political reasons play an important role. In your comment on Shorne's talk page you said that Stan was <i>not a full-time member of the <b>rightwing</b> clique that has been reverting your [Shorne's] work at random</i>. This phrase suggests that you perceive the conflict in political terms: Shorne and you vs the "rightwing clique". <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 17:06, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I opposed Shorne's POV-pushing. It was not me, but Shorne who reverted perpetually and sometimes blindly. If you had not been biased, you would have not backed Shorne and you would have not attributed right wing views to me, when you had no idea what my real political views were. Your bias was clearly visible and your comment suggested political reasons. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 00:02, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Boraczek, unfortunately topics concerning the Balkans have been, are and will be a battlefield, there are far too many conflicting viewpoints, not only about Macedonia, but also about Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sandjak. If I have been sharper to you than usual during the discussion, I am certainly appologising for that. And I am certainly willing to accept edits which are impersonal, impartial and based on co-operation. However, I am not willing to accept and I will not accept personally motivated and POV edits such as you made in the past - and which were also criticised and qualified by other users as questionable. I also don't accept the phrase "demolish" with regard to the article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Poland_9e37.html" title="Demographics of Poland">Demographics of Poland</a> where I used the same sources as you used for Greece and Bulgaria (apart from minority claims which I regard as clearly offensive but which you did not hesitate in the least to use against Bulgaria, did you?) This is, of course, unless you admit hereby that your aim was to "demolish" the articles about Bulgaria and Greece... If I may, I would advise you that you work on your diplomacy with regard to sensitive issues such as the Macedonian question where both Greece and Macedonia, as well as Bulgaria have overlapping and extremely conflicting viewpoints. I have not allowed myself to scream around on the pages <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_40e4.html" title="Demographics of the Republic of Macedonia">Demographics of the Republic of Macedonia</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> that the Macedonians are ethnic Bulgarians - such as my viewpoint is - as I regard this attitude as offensive. How did you allow yourself to do the same??? Regards <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 14:27, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)~</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Any particular reason to change 'dialect' to 'idiom' in the language list article? That use is now archaic or close to it. "Lects" might work, but that's pretty obscure, and 'dialects' is factually correct. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 01:47, 2005 August 13 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:ForRobin.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>Hey, I was wondering what's up with your picture of the Balkan peninsula according to the Danube-Sava-Kupa line. If you look at the history of the image (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Balkanpeninsula.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Balkanpeninsula.png" rel="nofollow">here</a>), your original version of the image does not appear to follow the line and it also has some odd holes in Dalmatia. Your second version, however, seems to be correct. Would you be so kind as to clarify this and note this in the image's discussion page so that we know which version you see as correct, since you are the author of both. I just want to prevent confusion on which version to revert back to. Thanks! <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdolen1_2131.html" title="User:Edolen1">edolen1</a> 12:43, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ciao, mi esprimo in lingua italiana perchè è quella che meglio conosco e mi rivolgo a te che conosci questa lingua. Penso che tu abbia la competenza per intervenire in <a href="../../../j/o/s/Talk%7EJosip_Broz_Tito_fcda.html" title="Talk:Josip Broz Tito">talk:Josip Broz Tito</a>: puoi dare un'occhiata dalla sezione intitolata <i>Tag</i> in poi? Se leggi alcune parti di questa pagina dall'inizio ti rendi conto che molti utenti contestano la faziosità di alcuni redattori iugoslavi che esaltano Tito come <i>leader</i> non <i>dictator</i> e gli attribuiscono solo meriti non ammettendo le sue responsabilità riguardo <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleiburg_massacre.html" title="Bleiburg massacre">Bleiburg massacre</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/i/Foibe_massacres.html" title="Foibe massacres">foibe massacres</a> e <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istrian_exodus.html" title="Istrian exodus">istrian exodus</a> nonchè <a href="../../../o/z/n/OZNA_7930.html" title="OZNA">OZNA</a> e <a href="../../../u/d/b/UDBA_5649.html" title="UDBA">UDBA</a>: tali utenti sono in particolare l'amministratore croato Dijxtra con lo sloveno Zocky e i serbi Dcabrilo e Zivan56. Tali utenti, anche se non lo dichiarano, sembrano comunisti fanatici e Dijxtra mi ha bloccato per un giorno perchè ho definito Zivan56 <i>un bugiardo</i>. Ho visto che stai contribuendo alla voce <i>foibe</i> in lingua slovena: ma in tale articolo si capisce chi infoibava e chi era infoibato? Dunque t'invito a lasciare un commento in tale pagina di discussione riguardo un articolo che alcuni <i>titoisti</i> pretendono di trasformare in testo di esaltazione del dittatore come esige <i>il culto della personalità</i>. Sai che io detesto tutti i totalitarismi e tutti i dittatori! Ciao,--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPIO_f9ae.html" title="User:PIO">PIO</a> 12:56, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have often heard and read that Polish people have a link with Croats. Not just catholic religion. Some say Croats came from Poland ...area Crakhow which means Croat. Also a USA census once showed thousnads of people who came from Poland said they were Polish Croats. I have also heard of towns eg something like Gradska in Poland has Nova(new) Gradska in Croatia which clearly shows Croats were from Poland and set up new towns after leaving Polish ones.</p>
<p>I have heard the joke Serbs say to Croats "You're all Polish". Must be truth to it</p>
<p>Do you know something??</p>
