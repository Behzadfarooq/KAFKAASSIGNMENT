<h2><span class="mw-headline">KarateKid7 etc.</span></h2>
<p>I am KarateKid7 and Karatekid7, I was not TheMADTim, this has never been verified and was described as likely, I dispute this. My initial account Karatekid7 was unfairly blocked by <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">user:jtdirl</a> . I was then later permanantly blocked by user:gator1 for removing the details of my previous block from my user page this admin has since disappeared. I then had KarateKid7 blocked by you for being a sockpuppet of Karatekid7 personally I do not think this was sockpuppeting as I thought it was very obvious and the account was created after my ban. I also considered the blocks to be unjust and did not know how to question them as my user page was blocked for Karatekid7. I think my edits show that whilst some of my edits may be considered controversial by some, I am no vandal, and I have reverted a good amount of vandalism myself. Simple fact is I could wait a week, register a new account with an unsimilar name and not be banned as a sockpuppet, so why ban me for being honest? --TheKarateKid7 02:17, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi BorgHunter, I noticed you recently substed a few {{deletedpage}} templates and I think that was a very good think to do. Thank you. Some people do seem to oppose it, though, please see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Template_talk%7EDeletedpage_a0b6.html#Subst.27ing" title="Template talk:Deletedpage">Template_talk:Deletedpage#Subst.27ing</a> if you would like to further participate to that discussion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Admin question Pt 4</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to bother you(not really) but I have yet another question. A new, very wordy, editor has moved into to an <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">FA article</a> you're very familiar with. His intentions(as he writes) are to "correct dramatic misunderstandings of Rush's style and music". The article that took so long to pare down in size has now ballooned to great enormity. I don't believe the editor read the two tags at the top of the talk page. In the process, by my quick reading, it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and a probably a few others. It's starting to read like a Rolling Stone record review. How does one approach that sort of situation without starting an rv war? Just wondering. Cheers and take care! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnger22_483f.html" title="User:Anger22">Anger22</a> 21:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't yet read your comments on your reason(s) for your reverts but I want to thank u for a polite, professional attitude. Wisdom89 decided to (rhetorically) kick me in the <i>cojones</i> instead of approaching me the way you did. I'll probably totally disagree with you, but that's not the point. The point is you know how to deal with people. Of this Wisdom89 clown, the less said the better.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way: in my neighborhood, where I grew up, if he'd popped off to someone like that to his face (or hers) he better be 6'4" &amp; 220 of muscle. You just <i>do not</i> talk to people like that. Only the anonymity of the Internet gives guys like him the courage to act the way he does. What a joke.</p>
<p>But you, I think you and I could have a civilized conversation no matter how much we disagreed on the substance of an issue. Of course, if your reasons turn out to be written like <i>his</i> I'll look the fool. But I'm hoping that what you wrote on my page is indicative of how you approach things in general.</p>

<dd><b>[03]</b>Your "explanation" of the block requires some explanation. Do you know what a "unilateral" reversion is? I was myself reverting a unilateral reversion, so my reversion was permitted under the wiki 3rr rules governing unilateral reversions. So do you agree that blocked me for a non-3rr issue? A reversion is forbidden when the reversion doesn't address the unanswered questions and concerns outstanding on the talk page, particularly where the reversion being reverted by me has been frequently made in the past without addressing the outstanding questions and concerns. Reversions of such unilateral reversions are permitted, which is all I did. My second question to you is: Did you read the full <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">Talk:Libertarianism</a> page before you blocked me? My third question to you is, were you a past participant on any of the talk pages concerning these disputes? My fourth question is, are you an associate of any of those who have previously participated?

<dd>Pat, I strongly urge you to stop this. You are not "allotted three reverts" during the course of the day, you are LIMITED to three reverts to prevent the exact same sort of revert-warring you are engaging in. Furthermore, you did violate the 3RR. BorgHunter legitimately blocked you for a short cool down period- after which you've chosen to violate Wikipedia's civility policy by calling him a "bully" and stating that "he is destroying wikipedia". You need to calm down and realize that you're not in the right here, and cool off a little. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 01:57, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>[07]</b>BorgHunter, when you added the minor "::" to my comments on your discussion page, you stated in the "edit summary" field the belligerent comment you should have stated in the discussion text, namely "Yes, the matter is closed. Mainly because I choose now to stop replying to it. Good day". That is not a rational response. You (and Daniel Davis above )are ignoring the KEY POINT, my reverts are ENTIREYLY CONSISTENT WITH ALL PRESENT WIKIPOLICY. It is those who revert my reverts WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING WIKIPOLICY. Consistent with the approach of consensus building, I have posed questions to the reverters, which they are merely ignoring, choosing to make the forbidden unilateral reverts, instead. Therefore they are the ones wiki policy requires you to warn and block, not me. The only reason for the blocks of me have been political and the result of "piling on", where the admins doing the warning and blocking have not actually looked at the facts to determine what has been going on, and who the policies should be enforced against. Three reverts a day of those who are unilaterally reverting my reversions, by failing to respond to the questions at paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> is ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH PRESENT WIKI POLICY? Do you agree that a response to relevant questions is a necessary part of consensus building, and that without it, "consensus" is just the forbidden "vote" <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">wikipedia: voting is evil</a>?

<dd>Hello Pat, sorry for the lack of response. Your comment got added at the same time as one by Mel Etitis below, and I looked at his without looking at yours first. I only noticed it when you added the paragraph numbers. My apologies.</dd>
<dd>You claim that I'm being a bully. Can you please provide evidence of this? If I seem that way to you, I apologize, this was never my intention. However, I would like to note that you have been tossing insults about on this talk page, such as "bully", and also suggesting that I be stripped of my sysop powers. If you plan, as stated in your edit summary, to make a complaint against me, these words will indeed come back to haunt you, and you may find yourself in hot water rather than the other way around. It is generally best, in a dispute, never to let your temper get the best of you, and to always follow <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for some of the rest, I see some misunderstandings of Wikipedia policy. "choosing to make the forbidden unilateral reverts", for example, is one. Reverts are not forbidden, as sometimes an editor or a group of editors may need to alter text that may not fit with other Wikipedia policies, such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Sometimes, reversions are the only way to make the text fit with such policies. It should not be taken as an attack on you or your prowess at editing articles. I further note that you make numerous references to consensus. I admit that I have not visited <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Libertarianism_da30.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Libertarianism_da30.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span> in a while, but last I was there, there were two or three editors reverting your changes, while you were the only one adding them or suggesting that the text be changed. To me, consensus would seem to be clearly in favor of the group of editors rather than your side. In my mind, if an editor is truly concerned about consensus, he would not make a large a disputed change, such as yours, once, much less repeatedly, without a note on the talk page and discussion on the proposed wording. Revert wars, such as the one you entered into, do nothing to further Wikipedia's goals, and are extremely detrimental to the project, as it causes tempers to run hot and people to lose their cool. As I have no desire for such behavior to continue, I blocked you for twenty-four hours, attempting to give you and the other side a chance to cool down, as well as hopefully demonstrating to you that such behavior is unacceptable. Your response to my block has been argumentative and petty, which is unfortunate, as I don't think my message has gotten through to you. My main point, which I beg of you to understand and take to heart, is that <b>Revert wars are harmful to Wikipedia</b>. There is no leeway allowed on that rule, nor is there any discussion to be made. Such behavior does nothing but turn Wikipedia into a haven for bickering, arguing, and doesn't help write articles. I would suggest to you that you not make another revert to Libertarianism at all, and instead, that you try to strive for consensus on the talk page. Revert warriors, no matter their cause, are frowned upon here. Please do not continue such behavior. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 20:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>[13]</b>"Bully" is a perfectly good english language word. It means "to bluster or domineer" (New Webster's Dictionary, Westin FL, 2005). Admins who don't investigate before they block, who don't give explanations for their blocks, and who speak and act without checking the facts, meet the definition and need to be dealt with as such.</p>
<p><b>[14]</b>"Ill-considered accusations of impropriety of one kind or another", such as you and the others have been making are what is defined as "incivil" [wp:civil].</p>
<p><b>[15]</b>Your latest problem as revealed above, is that you consider "voting" to establish "consensus". OF COURSE THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE (see wp:voting is evil and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wp%7Econsensus.html" title="Wp:consensus">wp:consensus</a>). If as an admin you still don't know so, that's more than one reason to eliminate you as an admin.</p>
<p><b>[16]</b>You also state "if an editor is truly concerned about consensus, he would not make a large a disputed change, such as yours, once, much less repeatedly, without a note on the talk page and discussion on the proposed wording". That is the whole point YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR MISSING - I DID make many comments on the talk page, and I have repeatedly provided the cites to it. I will do so again -,see paragraphs [113], [118], [224], [229], [231], and [235] on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk:libertarianism</a> page, which are still awaiting an answer so we can achieve consensus. You just keep proving you did not investigate before you blocked me, and that you have no interest in investigating to see if what you say is true. (Another major reason to eliminate you as an admin.)</p>
<p><b>[17]</b>You say you blocked me for making "unilateral reverts" (which I have never done). You have then given examples only of unilateral reverts you say are ok. As you unjustly blocked me for allegingly making "unilateral reverts", describe what you mean by <b>"the forbidden kind of unilateral reverts", as you have been asked to do.</b></p>
<p><b>[18]</b>Lastly, revert wars happen all the time in wikipedia, and sometimes they are the only way to get others to make an effort at achieving consensus - by encouraging them to respond to outstanding points on the talk page - the only real way to do it. (It's either that, or getting you to block them for their unilateral reverts -which do you prefer?) Your failure to answer the questions of paragraph <b>[03]</b> above, indicate you have something to hide. Combined with all of the above, you definitely should not be an admin. What is the procedure for accomplishing that? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 22:35, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not put words in my mouth; I've never suggested using voting to achieve consensus. I said that <i>discussion</i>, not voting, is necessary. Also, I am aware that you placed notes on the talk page; however, this does not excuse revert warring, which is <i>not</i> an acceptable method of editing, as you suggest. If you're making edits that are being reverted without discussion, follow <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. If there <i>is</i> discussion but the outcome is not in your favor, which is what I believe has happened...shoot for a compromise. Don't inflame tempers. I'd be glad to help you out in editing in this sort of fashion, if you wish—doing so creates a scenario in which people are far more willing to work with you. It also doesn't get you blocked under the 3RR.</dd>
<dd>If you wish more eyes to be on the situation (note that this is not a trial to get my sysop bit flipped), follow the steps on <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. That page states that if discussion has failed, <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html" title="WP:M">mediation</a> or a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> is next. A RfC is less formal, more open, and I would heavily advise against this course of action in view of your own outstanding RfC which has shown relatively few users supporting your view. Mediation is currently fairly backlogged, and I doubt you could get through. I'd like to head off either course of action, though, so as not to create undue work for Wikipedia. Again, I'm not sure what you desire from me...could you please say so? I'm a pretty easygoing guy, and I'm not unwilling to make accomodations for you, within reason. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 22:56, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>[19]</b>It is clear that reversions of my edits were unilateral, not the result of "discussion", in that "discussion" must be two-sided, and my questions at paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page are still awaiting an answer.</p>
<p><b>[20]</b>If you believe that "discusssion" is what is necessary to resolve edit wars, then we have no dispute. You and I need only to come to a joint conclusion on how that is achieved. Mediation and Rfc's accomplished nothing, in that only the original parties and their associates, took part, consisting of the same unfounded accusations, the same failure to answer my points, and the same ongoing failure of their admin cronies to actually read the talk page to see what had actually happened.</p>
<p><b>[21]</b>Right now, the only thing keeping a "non-definition" on the Libertarian page is a "majority vote" being enforced by a couple strong-arm admins, who haven't read the talk page and who don't respond to the points I raise in objecting to their block of me.</p>
<p><b>[22]</b>Discussion is necessary to achieve consensus, and discussion means "debate, examination" (New Webster's Dictionary, 2005, Westin FL), which requires the others to respond in the discussion, i.e. to answer paragarphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b>. As the only party being blocked is the only party willing to enage in discussion on the unresolved points, the problem of the wrongful blocking has got to addressed.</p>
<p><b>[23]</b>It is only because a cabal of editors have a couple of admin friends who they know will block me for reverting them, that keeps a "non-definition" and "false by implication" "definition" on the Libertarianism page, and which keeps them from participating in discussion. To my understanding, there are only two ways to encourage discussion (dispute resolution) with non-compliant parties under the wikipedia rules - doing three daily reverts and using blocking.</p>
<p><b>[24]</b>My three dailing reverts did finally begin to work, when Rehpotsirhc made an attempt to respond to my questions (insulting me in the process, but I don't mind as at least he responded) and to propose a compromise definition at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958</a>, but the others, knowing no attempt at consensus was necessary as long as they had strong-arm admins to enforce a mere majority vote, would not respond to efforts to parse that definition to see if it was the equivalent Rehpotsirhc believed it was, or whether it was an accurate definition if it was equivalent.</p>
<p><b>[25]</b>If the couple admins involved would just follow present wiki policy by allowing me my three reverts of unilateral reversion (or by blocking the unilateral reverters), the others will either engage in discussion (i.e. answer paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page, such that the outstanding issues will be resolved, or they will go elsewhere where they will do less harm, and we will finally have a chance to put the definition of Libertarianism on the Libertarianism page, rather than the absolute nonsense they have there now, and which they know cannot survive discussion.</p>
<p><b>[26]</b>Since you are presently the primary obstacle standing in the way of achieving discussion (i.e. consensus building) on the outstanding points (paragarphs [113], [118], [224] [229], [231], and [235] on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page), and since you have been violating wiki policy in blocking me for using my three revert allotment to encourage consensus building (i.e. consensus-building through discussion on the talk page), and in failing to block the others for their unilateral reversions of me (in violation of 3rr, even though using less than 3 reverts a day) by failing to respond to the outstanding quetsions on the talk page (paragarphs [113], [118], [224] [229], [231], and [235]), the main problem right now to "how wikipedia is supposed to work" is you, and such as the one other admin who also blocked me without investigating ("piling on").

<dd>Well, ceasing to refer to the 3RR as giving you "an allotment of three reverts" is a good first step, because that is explicitly not so. Secondly, I encourage you not to edit war, and to discuss on the talk page. That's really about it; I don't wish to throw my hat into the ring on the Libertarianism dispute.

<p><b>[28]</b>No, not good enough. I DO have an allotment of three reverts a day, particularly where those reverts are NECESSARY to encourage the others to engage in discussion, there being no other means to achieve consensus. My use of reverts was ENTIRELY WITHING WIKI POLICY, and you know it. It's not like you don't like confrontation (blocking is a form of confrontation), it's that you don't like investigating before you confront, or engaging in discussion after you confront - you just like to use the bully power. Five votes, and two admin cronies to enforce it, have succeeded in keeping the definition of Libertarianism off the Libertarianism page - not the way wikipedia is supposed to work.

<dd>BorgHunter's exactly right here, Pat. You say, "I DO have an allotment of three reverts a day". But that's simply not the case. The point of 3RR is to stop edit wars in their tracks. This does not mean that it's the only way to stop edit wars -- just one of the quickest. Habitual edit warriors very quickly discover that 3 or even 2 reverts will get them blocked. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 16:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Q. Section 8.167 (3) of the 15th Manual of Style says that, when applying headline style, a preposition should be capitalized if it is stressed (<i>A River Runs Through It</i>).

<dd>A. We are talking about how it sounds to the ear—admittedly, a somewhat murky rule. A river <i>runs</i> through it? A river runs through <i>it</i>? No—a river runs <i>through</i> it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rush "reverts"</span></h2>
<p>I posted my revised revert of the section in question of the Rush article before I hit my user talk page. I figured it would be more abuse, so I skipped it at first.</p>
<p>You'll take it as you wish, but I was <i>not</i> deliberately intending to get "cyberspatially" in your face. It wasn't personal.</p>
<p>However, I'm still not sure I agree with this sandbox thing. It's not been explained to my satisfaction how this squares with merciless editing--one of the things that drew me to participate in the first place.</p>
<p>Or who and how it is decided what the final version of the article is to be. Especially since we obviously have some diametrically-opposed views.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rush article: Peachy for whom?</span></h2>
<p>In re: Rush article</p>
<p><i>To help us reach consensus, a sandbox version (and revert-free zone!) of the Rush article has been created at Rush (band)/Sandbox. Once we get to a version everyone agrees with, we can merge that back with the main article. Please remember not to revert any other person's edits, and stay away from the main Rush article for the time being, and we'll all be peachy. Thanks!</i></p>
<p>Peachy for whom? I'm not feeling very peachy. If we can't edit, can't add our opinion, can't make changes, then what's the bloody point? I'm just supposed to wait while you and your friends email the article back and forth and then post a version you like--and then, I suppose, the page will be locked down--SOL PM!</p>
<p>Sorry but I have major, major problems with this approach. I really don't think I can adhere to it.</p>
<p>At least not without further discussion and explanation. <a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainMan_fa33.html" title="User:PainMan">PainMan</a> 19:48, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, your other option is to be nearly universally reverted. No fewer than three people have wholly rejected your edits, and I don't think there's any other way they'd stick.

<p><br />
Then to quote my favorite "wascally wabbit": "Of course you know, this means war."</p>
<p>I wanted to play nice. Obviously the totalitarian claque that's highjacked the Rush article is only interested in its own opinions.</p>
<p>Just as I thought the consensus of the Wiki-Politburo is: "PainMan go pound sand!"</p>
<p>How much did you guys pay for the page? Can I have verfication of the purchase?</p>
<p>You change it. I'll change it back. You'll change, I'll change it back. Eventually one of us is going to give up. It ain't gonna be me.</p>
