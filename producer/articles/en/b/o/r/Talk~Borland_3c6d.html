<p>It appears that the Irish company went bankrupt. It appears that there were debts, some of them settled by the bankruptcy court. The name in particular was acquired in 1983 by MIT, a California Corporation, which changed it's name to Borland International. (The Irish name seem to have been "Borland Ltd.")</p>

<p>OK, I know my memory is fairly faulty, but I seem to recall that part of what Borland into the forefront in the early years was a drastic reduction in prices. When many programs were going for like $495, Borland started selling solid alternatives for $99. Does anyone else remember this? And, if so, it ought to be included. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 15:20, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're in essential agreement then. Isn't it also the case that these prices helped bring Borland a lot of publicity and market share at the time? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 16:13, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I recall that I heard of JRT Pascal before Turbo Pascal and that also was advertised for about $49 - this is backed up by the Wikipedia article JRT Pascal. I understood at the time that the developer of JRT could not keep up with the demand so it fizzled out fairly quickly. Also, being cheap was only any good if it was reliable. I had already switched from using Pascal to Modula-2 by then - Modula-2 compilers for the PC were also in the $400-$500 range. I can probably dig out some Pascal ads from copies of the Journal of Pascal, Ada and Modula-2 from that time when I'm back in the office on Monday. Chris Burrows 12:30, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In May 1984, Softech Microsystems was advertising UCSD Pascal with the 'Insight Window Designer' as a special deal for $399. It wasn't just price, however, Turbo Pascal, being a memory-resident system, was innovative with its much improved edit-compile-run turnaround time. Competing development systems at the time were slow, floppy-disk, multi-pass compiler based systems overlayed to squeeze into 64Kb (yes, 64Kb!) of RAM. Chris Burrows 00:40, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Two more pieces of information on that advert and the launch: First the ad was wrttien in partnership by Alex Morton (Canadian Citizen that seem to have been an early creative force at Borland and who had a direct mail background) and Philippe Kahn. Second apparently they wanted a demo program with Turbo Pascal before it shipped and Kahn wrote in one afternoon "MiniCalc" complete with source code, which was a spreadsheet with the functionality of Visicalc... It was the first time that the source code of functional software like this was released. Kahn was apparently pretty handy at writing code. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.171.5.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.171.5.35_3ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.171.5.35">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Sounds like an urban myth - if he had written it from scratch that would amount to a programming rate of about 2-300 lines per hour!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Exactly: The innovstion in Turbo Pascal was *not* the compiler. It was the IDE, the first real IDE and that was the huge difference between all other systems and Turno Pascal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on what you mean by 'real IDE'. UCSD Pascal had an integrated edit / compile / run system a few years before Turbo Pascal came on the scene.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is my understanding that Philippe Kahn designed the IDE and then looked for a compiler to plug into the IDE. That's when he licensed the compiler in the Danish "Compass Pascal". That compiler was a simple recursive descent compiler modelled after the one in Niklaus Wirth's Tiny Pascal that is part of "Algorithms+Data Structures=Programs". The irony is that apparently Philippe studied with Wirth on the ETH and assisted Wirth as a young student in editing that book and imnplement the first Pascal compiler on the ETH's mainframe.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.171.5.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.171.5.35_3ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.171.5.35">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>No - apparently not. I don't know about any involvement with the book, but I do know that Wirth credits the development of the first Pascal compiler (after the first unsuccessful attempt by E. Marmier to write one in FORTRAN) to three people: U. Ammann, E. Marmier and R. Schild. REF: N. Wirth: <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378" rel="nofollow"><i>Recollections about the Development of Pascal.</i></a> ACM SIGPLAN Notices, Volume 28, No 3, March 1993. Note also that Kahn studied Maths at ETH whereas Wirth was Professor of Informatics.</dd>
<dd>Chris Burrows 06:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually Niklaus Wirth and Kahn are prett close clearly for us who have seen them together, like when they filmed "The World of Objects". Wirth seems very proud of his student and Kahn likes to launch on long technical conversations and recollections.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which part of the video are you referring to? You can view it at <a href="http://www.turboexplorer.com/worldofobjects" class="external free" title="http://www.turboexplorer.com/worldofobjects" rel="nofollow">http://www.turboexplorer.com/worldofobjects</a>. Niklaus Wirth is not even acknowledged as being the creator of Pascal - "Leading Computer Scientist" indeed! Chris Burrows 02:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>he was apparently a first to thrird year student taking the required programming classes in Pascal from Wirth and got involved "by accident" but loved it. Apparently he was in charge of checking the "Tiny Pascal" recurring descent compiler who's source-cde you can find in the Pascal version of "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs", Wirth's calssic text book. So for sure the ETH, Wirth are very aware of Kahn and vise versa. The World of Object project was enlightning as we all that were involved were able to see the close relationship between Kahn and Wirth, Minsky, Alan Kay etc...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wirth might well have known Kahn if he was an undergrad student of his but many of his students would have had the task of dissecting the PL/0 (its proper name) compiler as part of their course. Mr H. Sandmayr is credited with the task of proofreading the book. I have not seen a single mention of Kahn in any of Wirth's publications although he credits many others who were involved in the early days of Pascal. I can't see any evidence from the video of any close relationships whatsoever. Each of the people mentioned are being interviewed in what appears to be a public place - it looks to me like the general sales area of a conference. It could have been anybody asking them a question. Chris Burrows 02:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that it surprised us all as it became clear that his heart was more in the technology and the inventions part than the business part. Probably one of the reasons that at the end Microsoft got the better of them: Kahn was probably way too obsessed with software crafstmanship while Microsoft was focused on market share and financial gains.

<p>This text was added by an anon (no other edits) on 2005-06-16 with no comment or source. Every other source, except Wikipedia mirrors, assert that Phillippe Kahn was the founder of Borland.

<p>The challenge is that all these stories seem to have been written "later". Kind of rewriting history.... The fact seems to be that between 1982 and 1994 Philippe Kahn was President, Cbairman and CEO and that none of these "so called founders" had any role or any title in the company. Not even directors. You'd think that they would have had some official status....? So I'd tend to believe that they sold the name of the company as part of their bankruptcy as they probably owed money for consulting work performed in the USA. They also seem to have disapeared in the aether too. You'd think that anyone with that kind of stature would have had some success in the high technology industry? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.171.5.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.171.5.35_3ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.171.5.35">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>As far as I know "Borland, Ltd." and "Borland International" are two completely different companies. The text quoted is accurate as far as it goes but doesn't quite make this clear. Kahn is the founder of "Borland International," but he got the <i>name</i> from "Borland, Ltd." I don't know if he got anything else, or just the name.

<dd>I believe that was because they were 'just the developers' i.e. the ones doing the actual programming work. It is likely that all three, but definitely at least one, of the Danes, Niels Jensen, stayed with Borland. Niels was working on the Modula-2 compiler when he eventually left in 1987 taking other members of the development team with him to found another company - Jensen and Partners International. JPI were the creators of the TopSpeed Development System with inter-operating Modula-2, Pascal, C and C++ compilers which is still, today, the underlying technology of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarion_programming_language.html" title="Clarion programming language">Clarion programming language</a>.

<p>Well a good source are the various prospectus put out for the public offerening. The 1986 public offering prospectus for the London IPO has a simple reference of the fact that the only link is that the Irish company was bankrupt and that Borland Inc. acquired the rights to the name. It seems that MIT had done some technical consulting work for the Danish/Irish company and that it was owed money. The debt seem to have been settled for the rights to the name, when MIT was forced by attorneys from MIT.edu to change its name. the other mystey is why three Danes in Irland... The best answer that seems to have been provided is "tax optimizition" (a polite way to say that the Danes may have thought that they'd become millionaires and didn't want to pay the 75% taxes in Denmark (who would blame them?) and acquired an off-the-shelf company in Irland, which seemd to have a double taxation agreement with Denmark....). This would all explain why those Danes never returned for years to Denmark and moved to Irland/UK territories. It sounds fishy. The bankruptcy avoided taxes too..... In the wrong way I suppose....<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.171.5.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.171.5.35_3ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.171.5.35">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Quite the opposite I think. This is the reason that Dell and many others setup shop in the Republic of Irland is a special "trading zone" next to Dublin. They had in the early 80s huge tax incentives. For Danish people that were used to a 75% tax burden, it was panacea, as long as they were prepared to exile themsleves from Denmark, which these people seem to have done. It appears that one of them even changed his last name from Ole Rasmussen to Ole Henriksen? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.171.5.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.171.5.35_3ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.171.5.35">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I believe that Dale Fuller was fired by the company; he did not resign. Many press articles misreported it as a resignation, and Borland made no effort to correct them, and seems, in my experience, to be hiding the truth. So you have to dig a little deeper in some SEC filings to find out what actually happened.</p>
<p>The company itself chooses the ambiguous term "stepped down" in its press release (<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=112793&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=727866&amp;highlight=" class="external free" title="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=112793&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=727866&amp;highlight=" rel="nofollow">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=112793&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=727866&amp;highlight=</a>), as well as in their filings to the SEC.</p>
<p>In this filing (<a href="http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2005/07/07/0001193125-05-138914.html" class="external free" title="http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2005/07/07/0001193125-05-138914.html" rel="nofollow">http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2005/07/07/0001193125-05-138914.html</a>), Item 5.02(b), it is revealed that "Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Fuller will receive from the Company...a cash lump sum payment of $1.2 million."</p>
<p>Referring to his Employment Agreement (<a href="http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2001/03/29/0000950130-01-001500.html" class="external free" title="http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2001/03/29/0000950130-01-001500.html" rel="nofollow">http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2001/03/29/0000950130-01-001500.html</a>), Exhibit 10.20, page 3, paragraph 4, "Benefits Upon Termination by Company", it states that he shall receive a cash lump sum equal to his annual salary (which was $1.2 million). However paragraph 5, "Benefits Upon Termination by Executive", specifically states that "no other payments or benefits shall be made".</p>
<p>The fact that Fuller received the severance pay proves that his employment was terminated BY THE COMPANY. I.e., he was fired. If he had resigned, according to his employment contract, he would not have gotten his massive cash lump sum gift for leaving. -- Suzll</p>
