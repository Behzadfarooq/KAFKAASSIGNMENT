<p>Hiya, I ought to write an article on that soon&#160;;) Anyway, the concept is basically identical to a substitute in football, one player goes off and another player takes on his responsibilities. The tactic normally used by the team fielding first is to bowl out their weakest batsman (someone like <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_McGrath_73db.html" title="Glenn McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a>) and then take him off for a substitute player - who can not bowl, as McGrath has already bowled his ten overs, but can bat for him - and can bat anywhere in the order they'd like to have him. Thus, they're effectively playing seven batsmen and five bowlers. The player who has gone off can not return to the game again. Also, if the player who's going off has bowled, say, eight overs, the new player can't bowl more than two overs. The reason why it's called super sub? The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">ICC</a> like corny names, I suppose. Can't say I like the rule much, but at least Test cricket doesn't have it (yet...*shudders*). Lastly, go England in the Ashes&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 15:42, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-Day_Internationals_in_England_in_2005_78d1.html#NatWest_Series" title="One-Day Internationals in England in 2005">NatWest <i>Series</i></a> didn't use it - that was the tri-series between England, Australia and Bangladesh. However, the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-Day_Internationals_in_England_in_2005_78d1.html#NatWest_Challenge" title="One-Day Internationals in England in 2005">NatWest <i>Challenge</i></a> (the 3-ODI series between England and Australia) did, just to confuse things. Btw, you can still have a normal injury sub in addition to the super sub - something Australia exploited in the first ODI of the series (IIRC), when <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_Watson_1c2b.html" title="Shane Watson">Shane Watson</a> bowled three overs, went off with an injury, then <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Hayden_0760.html" title="Matthew Hayden">Matthew Hayden</a> (who wasn't selected) came on as an injury sub, then Australia took off Hayden and put on <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Hogg_a075.html" title="Brad Hogg">Brad Hogg</a>, and finally put Hayden back on as a 12th man fielder for Watson! The net effect was that, if required, Hogg could have bowled ten overs, as he wasn't coming in for the man who had bowled three. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 16:11, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Borb. Thank you for commenting on my user-talk page about the images I have recently uploaded. As I stated over on WikiProject Chemicals, I'm not a chemist, just a guy who likes to make 3D-models. Apart from uploading the stuff to Commons, which is really a no-brainer (sometimes I'm just weird&#160;:-), are the images I created for all the amino-acids the correct forms? Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of abovementioned discussion, before I created them, so I just went ahead. Any comments are greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstroeck_3315.html" title="User:Mstroeck">Mstroeck</a> 00:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just happened to see it on the page for <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> so I thought i'd try it out on that page too.

<p>Hi! I see your self-drawn halogenation mechanism in the article <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkene.html" title="Alkene">alkene</a> but I think that it is incorrect. <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halonium_ion.html" title="Halonium ion">Halonium ion</a> is formed instead of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbocation.html" title="Carbocation">carbocation</a> in observation.
