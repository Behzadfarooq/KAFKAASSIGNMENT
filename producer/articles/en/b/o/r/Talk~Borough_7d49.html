<p>The term "borough" refers to municipalities. Not all municipalities are called boroughs (as there are cities, towns, townships, villages), but for governmental purposes a borough in NJ and PA is no different than any other incorporated municipality. In CT it's a different story, as a borough is just a section of a larger township.</p>

<p>Some villages in Pennsylvania are signed as such, but there is no division of government in Pennsylvania known as a village. There is a division of government in Pennsylvania known as town, but the state has only one town, Bloomsburg in Columbia County.

<p>I'm doing some research on local government infrastructure in the UK, but cannot find a definitive answer: what is the difference between a District council and a Borough council?</p>
<p>If I read this article correctly, each borough council in the country has the right to elect a mayor but DC's do not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no practical difference in terms of administration; non-Metropolitan Local Authorities, whether called Boroughs or Districts (or Cities) have the same functions and terms of reference (excepting those which are Unitary or Metropolitan which are single-tier). However, the authorities called "Boroughs" are generally urban, or at least based on a town or city of some size, and geographically somewhat smaller; whereas "Districts" are generally rural or comprise of a number of smallish towns spread over a larger geographic area. Other than that, the differences are just ceremonial or historical, for example whether they have a Royal or City Charter. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_England_a4ad.html" title="Districts of England">Districts_of_England</a> gives a clearer overview. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 01:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Pennsylvania at least, a borough is a community without a large enough population to be classified as a city; most cities in PA started out as boroughs. I don't know if this is true in other states, so the statement "In some states of the U.S., such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, a self-governing city or town is called a borough." may have been misleading, because it implies that all cities are boroughs. I replaced this wording in the article but I only really know about Pennsylvania, so my replacement may need fixing. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottAlanHill_8ac5.html" title="User:ScottAlanHill">ScottAlanHill</a> 04:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think so. A couple quotes from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_R._Stewart_243c.html" title="George R. Stewart">George R. Stewart</a>'s book <i>Names on the Land</i>, about placenames in the United States after the Revolution: "Any -ton along the eastern seaboard may formerly have been a -town, just as any -burg or -boro was probably once a -burgh or -borough. This last suffix declined. Unlike -burgh, it was thought to be too British. After the Revolution it was less commonly used, and some -boroughs actually changed their names." And, describing the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_on_Geographic_Names_dbec.html" title="Board on Geographic Names">Board on Geographic Names</a> 1891 report on standardization recommendations for placename changes: "Names should avoid the possessive forms, diacritic characters, and hyphens. They should drop <i>City</i> and <i>-town</i>, the <i>-h</i> of <i>-burgh</i>, the <i>-ugh</i> of <i>-borough</i>, ..." For a few decades, many names were changed in these ways, until the fight over the final -h of Pittsburgh took the wind out of the Board's sails. <a href="../../../p/f/l/User%7EPfly_f5cb.html" title="User:Pfly">Pfly</a> 04:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The British definition is somewhat archaic. Possibly better - a district, administered by an elected council, with a largely urban character and having had Borough status granted. Historically, a town with certain privileges granted by Royal Charter or later by Act of Parliament, or that sent a representative to parliament.</p>

<p>I am about to tag the US section for accuracy because I believe that several statements are dubious and that the entire section could use a good fact-checking. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In most American uses of the term, a village is an incorporated, partially autonomous municipality which is subject to the supervisory authority of the township and county in which it is located.</i> I know that this is true of some states, but I doubt that it's accurate to say that <i>most</i> American uses of the term follow that definition, since villages can also be special taxation districts rather than incorporated municipalities and can exist in states with no townships.</li>
<li><i>Cities are invariably exempt from such supervisory authority in the United States.</i> So cities in the U.S. are invariably <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_city.html" title="Independent city">independent cities</a>? Sorry, but no.</li>
<li><i>whereas most states use a three-tiered system of decentralization - state/county/township</i> While it's true that <i>some</i> states are organized in that fashion, many aren't.</li>

<dd>You're spot on with your observations. It is difficult to make meaningful generalizations about local government in the U.S. as a whole without also including extensive qualifying statements. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 16:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term "village" is not used in Iowa, and frankly sounds quaint. A couple of suburbs of Chicago are styled "villages"; I believe that indicates something about the form of municipal government used, but I'm not sure of that. The usage purveyed as "most" in the article is the use in New York, which I explain to out-of-staters as meaning what "town" or "city" means most places; the term "town", I explain, refers to what is essentially a sub-county. Perhaps these uses aren't unique to New York; I had thought of the system as an entirely New York idiosyncracy. 71.247.77.207 03:51, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sub-county as in <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_township.html" title="Civil township">Civil township</a>? The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland_Land_Company_b13d.html" title="Holland Land Company">Holland Land Company</a> page has a nice map showing the counties and townships (called "towns") of Western New York. I grew up in the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williamsville%2C_New_York_11bf.html" title="Williamsville, New York">Village of Williamsville</a>, in the <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst%2C_New_York_f14a.html" title="Amherst, New York">Town of Amherst</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erie_County%2C_New_York_fad6.html" title="Erie County, New York">Erie County, New York</a>, and always thought it weird that one could live in a village AND a town. In Maine, the system is more confusing.. the whole state is divided into what look like the equivalent of townships, but some are called townships, some "plantations", some just "towns", and quite a few other names. They are properly called "minor civil divisions", I think. In Washington State there are no towns that I know of. Even though the land was surveyed under the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Land_Survey_System_a335.html" title="Public Land Survey System">Public Land Survey System</a> into townships, local government within a county is either a "city" or "unincorporated county". The wide variety of local government systems, terms, and ways of dividing up land in the United States could be an article of its own... and maybe should be!
