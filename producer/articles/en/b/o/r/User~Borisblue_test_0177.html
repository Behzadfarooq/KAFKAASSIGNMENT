<p>Schiavo experienced <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a> and collapsed in her home in early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, incurring massive brain damage. She remained in a coma for ten weeks. Within three years, she was diagnosed to be in a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistent_vegetative_state.html" title="Persistent vegetative state">persistent vegetative state</a> (PVS) with little chance of recovery.</p>
<p>Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Schiavo's husband and guardian <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schiavo_9921.html" title="Michael Schiavo">Michael Schiavo</a> petitioned the courts to remove the gastric <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeding_tube.html" title="Feeding tube">feeding tube</a> keeping Schiavo alive; Schiavo's parents Robert and Mary Schindler fought a series of legal battles opposing Michael. The courts consistently found that Schiavo was in a PVS and had made credible statements that she would not want to be kept alive on a machine. By <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2005.html" title="March 2005">March 2005</a>, the legal history around the Schiavo case included fourteen appeals and innumerable motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in Federal District Court; Florida legislation struck down by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Florida_90d0.html" title="Supreme Court of Florida">Supreme Court of Florida</a>; a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subpoena.html" title="Subpoena">subpoena</a> by a congressional committee in an attempt to qualify Schiavo for "witness protection"; federal legislation (<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Sunday_Compromise_4119.html" title="Palm Sunday Compromise">Palm Sunday Compromise</a>); and four denials of <i><a href="../../../c/e/r/Certiorari.html" title="Certiorari">certiorari</a></i> from the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ACLU.OppositionToInjunctionBrief"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_ACLU.OppositionToInjunctionBrief" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_ACLU.OppositionToInjunctionBrief" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Despite these interventions, the courts continued to find that Schiavo was in a PVS with no hope for recovery, and would want to cease life support. Her feeding tube was removed a third and final time on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<p>She met Michael Schiavo in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> in a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a> class at <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucks_County_Community_College_4847.html" title="Bucks County Community College">Bucks County Community College</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown%2C_Bucks_County%2C_Pennsylvania_aa22.html" title="Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania">Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania</a>. He was her first boyfriend. After dating for five months, the couple became engaged. They were married on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton%2C_Pennsylvania_d9d5.html" title="Southampton, Pennsylvania">Southampton, Pennsylvania</a>. They moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, in April <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Schiavo's parents also moved to St. Petersburg three months later. In Florida, she worked as an insurance claims clerk for the <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prudential.html" title="Prudential">Prudential</a> <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance_company.html" title="Insurance company">insurance company</a>, and her husband was a restaurant manager.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, the Schiavos began visiting an <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstetrician.html" title="Obstetrician">obstetrician</a> and receiving <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertility.html" title="Fertility">fertility</a> services and counseling in the hopes of having a child. At this time Schiavo's weight had dropped to 120 <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_%28mass%29.html" title="Pound (mass)">pounds</a>, and she had stopped <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menstrual_cycle.html" title="Menstrual cycle">menstruating</a>.

<p>On the morning of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">February 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, at approximately 5:30 a.m. EST, Schiavo experienced <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a> and collapsed in the hallway of the St. Petersburg <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartment.html" title="Apartment">apartment</a> she shared with her husband. <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighter.html" title="Firefighter">Firefighters</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramedic.html" title="Paramedic">paramedics</a> arriving in response to her husband's <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> call found her face down and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconsciousness.html" title="Unconsciousness">unconscious</a> in the hallway outside her bathroom. She was not breathing and had no pulse. Attempts were made to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation.html" title="Cardiopulmonary resuscitation">resuscitate</a> Schiavo, and she was <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defibrillation.html" title="Defibrillation">defibrillated</a> several times while she was transported to the Humana Northside <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">Hospital</a>. There, in order to keep her alive, she was <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intubation.html" title="Intubation">intubated</a>, ventilated, and eventually given a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracheotomy.html" title="Tracheotomy">tracheotomy</a>. She remained <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">comatose</a> for two and a half months. When she emerged from the coma, she never exhibited any evidence of higher cortical function. The long period of <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anoxia.html" title="Anoxia">anoxia</a> she sustained had led to profound brain injury (termed "anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy"), severely damaging those parts of the brain concerned with <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognition.html" title="Cognition">cognition</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perception.html" title="Perception">perception</a>, and awareness. While initially fed by means of a nasogastric <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeding_tube.html" title="Feeding tube">feeding tube</a>, she eventually received a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percutaneous_endoscopic_gastrostomy.html" title="Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy">percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy</a> (PEG) feeding tube—inserted through the abdominal wall.</p>
<p>The cause of her cardiac arrest has never been determined. For a time, it was believed that her cardiac arrest had been caused by an imbalance of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrolytes.html" title="Electrolytes">electrolytes</a> in her blood. On admission to hospital, her serum <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium.html" title="Potassium">potassium</a> level was noted to be very low, at 2.0 <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivalent_%28chemistry%29.html" title="Equivalent (chemistry)">mEq</a>/<a href="../../../l/i/t/Litre.html" title="Litre">L</a>; the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0 mEq/L. It was speculated that her low potassium level had in turn been caused by an eating disorder; her medical chart contained a note that "she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iced_tea.html" title="Iced tea">iced tea</a>". However, there has never been any hard evidence that Schiavo had an eating disorder, and the low potassium could have been a spurious result caused by the intravascular administration of fluids during the attempt to resuscitate her.</p>

<p>Schiavo came home to her family in September; however, after becoming overwhelmed with her needs, the family sent her back to the College Park facility. In November, Michael took his wife to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_San_Francisco_0ec6.html" title="University of California, San Francisco">University of California, San Francisco</a> for an experimental procedure involving the placement of a <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalamic_stimulator.html" title="Thalamic stimulator">thalamic stimulator</a> implant in her brain. The experimental treatment took several months but was unsuccessful. Michael returned to Florida with her in January <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and admitted his wife to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center (specializing in brain injuries) in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradenton%2C_Florida_c998.html" title="Bradenton, Florida">Bradenton, Florida</a>, often "taking her to parks and public places in hopes of sparking some recovery". There she received 24-hour care. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Schiavo was transferred to the Sable Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_therapy.html" title="Speech therapy">speech</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupational_therapy.html" title="Occupational therapy">occupational therapy</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Two and a half months after her cardiac arrest, Schiavo emerged from her coma and entered a condition that was diagnosed as a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistent_vegetative_state.html" title="Persistent vegetative state">persistent vegetative state</a> (PVS). Schiavo regained a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circadian_rhythm.html" title="Circadian rhythm">sleep-wake cycle</a>, but never exhibited repeatable and consistent awareness of herself or environment. Dr. Garcia J. DeSousa, a board-certified neurologist in St. Petersburg, Florida, cared for Schiavo during her initial admission to hospital; both he and Dr. Victor Gambone, an internist and Schiavo family physician, independently made the diagnosis within approximately one year after Schiavo's cardiac arrest. Other neurologists—Drs. Jeffery M. Karp, James H. Barnhill, and Thomas H. Harrison—also examined Schiavo over the years and made the same diagnosis; they also shared a very poor opinion about her chances for recovery. No dissent regarding Schiavo's condition or the PVS diagnosis was raised by any parties at this point.</p>

<p>After the failure of challenges to Michael's guardianship and to the ruling on Schiavo's end-of-life wishes, the Schindlers adopted the position that Schiavo was not in a PVS and began to challenge that diagnosis in court.</p>
<p>Schiavo's parents claim that their daughter did not meet the definition of a persistent vegetative state, and was in a "minimally conscious state" instead. Her parents argued that at times her actions were indicative of responses to external stimuli, not reflex or instinctive behavior. For example, the Schindlers claimed that their daughter smiled, laughed, cried, moved, made childlike attempts at speech, and attempted to say "Mom" or "Dad"; or "yeah" when they asked her a question. They claimed that when they kissed her she looked at them and sometimes puckered her lips.</p>

The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the 2nd DCA.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Schiavo's condition.

<p>As part of the court ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Schiavo "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips totaling almost six minutes and released those clips to public websites. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_VideoArticle"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_VideoArticle" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_VideoArticle" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Judge Greer ruled that Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_1stFeedingTubeRemovalOrder"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_1stFeedingTubeRemovalOrder" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_1stFeedingTubeRemovalOrder" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></sup></span> This ruling was later affirmed by Florida's 2nd District Court of Appeal, which stated that "this court has closely examined all of the evidence in the record," and "we have...carefully observ[ed] the video tapes in their entirety."

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube to provide for "eight weeks' therapy." Accompanying the petition were four affidavits from members of the Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses.</p>
<p>One of the nurses, Carla Sauer Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, "do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you're terminated." She also claimed that Michael said "When is that bitch gonna die?" and that he made many other similar statements. She stated that on five different occasions, she tested Schiavo's blood sugar levels after Michael visited her, and she found that her blood sugar levels were so low it wouldn't even register a number. She stated that it was medically possible that Michael injected his wife with insulin in an attempt to kill her. Iyer stated that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she "would call them anyway." Iyer stated that she eventually called the police and was fired the next day.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, Judge Greer denied the petition, and wrote that "the Petition is an attempt by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to relitigate the entire case. It is not even a veiled or disguised attempt. The exhibits relied upon by them clearly demonstrate this to be true."</p>
<p>Regarding Iyer's claims, Greer wrote that they were "incredible to say the least" and that "Ms. Iyer details what amounts to a 15-month cover-up [April 1995 through July 1996] which include the staff of Palm Garden of Largo Convalescent Center, the Guardian of the Person, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the medical professionals, the police and, believe it or not, Mr. and Mrs. Schindler...It is impossible to believe that Mr. and Mrs. Schindler would not have subpoenaed Ms. Iyer for the January 2000 evidentiary hearing had Iyer contacted them [in 1996] as her affidavit alleges."

Six days later, following the passing of "Terri's Law", Florida Governor <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jeb_Bush_d0e2.html" title="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush</a> sent armed men to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to a hospital, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted. (8th paragraph from the bottom of news story) <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_2ndFeedingTubeRemoval.ABC.story"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_2ndFeedingTubeRemoval.ABC.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_2ndFeedingTubeRemoval.ABC.story" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></sup></span> Part of the legislation required the appointment of a guardian ad litem, Dr. Jay Wolfson, to "deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests" of Schiavo, and report them to Governor Bush.</p>
<p>Wolfson visited Schiavo at least daily over the course of a month. In December, 2003, he submitted his report, referring to himself in the third person as "the GAL". His central finding was: <i>"The GAL was not able to independently determine that there were consistent, repetitive, intentional, reproducible interactive and aware activities.</i>" He notes further, that when joined by her parents no success was gained in eliciting a repetitive or consistent response from Schiavo.</p>
<p>In examining medical records and consultations surrounding the case, Wolfson concluded: "(that there is) well documented information that she is in a persistent vegetative state with no likelihood of improvement, and that the neurological and speech pathology evidence in the file support the contention that she cannot take oral nutrition or hydration and cannot consciously interact with her environment." He observed further that while there appeared to be agreement about Schiavo and PVS: "the Schindlers have adopted what appears to be a position that Theresa is not in a persistent vegetative state, and/or that they do not support the fact that such a medical state exists at all."</p>
<p>Wolfson addressed two criticisms that media attention had affixed to the Schindlers and Michael Schiavo, respectively. That the Schindlers would keep their daughter alive to the point of her "limbs being amputated," was not accurate according to Wolfson. Of suggestions that Michael Schiavo refused to relinquish his guardianship because of financial interests or to cover up previous abuse, Wolfson reported that "there is no evidence in the record to substantiate any of these perceptions or allegations."</p>
<p>In addressing the issue of law surrounding the case, Wolfson concluded "that the trier of fact and the evidence that served as the basis for the decisions regarding Theresa Schiavo were firmly grounded within Florida statutory and case law, which clearly and unequivocally provide for the removal of artificial nutrition in cases of persistent vegetative states."</p>

The order was appealed to the 2nd DCA the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law.

Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right.

The <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_brain.html" title="Human brain">brain</a> itself weighed 615 g, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight.</p>
<p>Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain.html" title="List of regions in the human brain">brain regions</a>, including the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_cortex.html" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalamus.html" title="Thalamus">thalami</a>, the basal nuclei, the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocampus.html" title="Hippocampus">hippocampus</a>, the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebellum.html" title="Cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midbrain.html" title="Midbrain">midbrain</a>. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuron.html" title="Neuron">neurons</a> that comprise some 70 percent of cortical cells—critical to the functioning of the cortex—were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, is also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalami)—another common pathologic hallmark of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ThogmartinComment"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_ThogmartinComment" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_ThogmartinComment" rel="nofollow">[61]</a></sup></span> Dr. Stephen J.

As the condition is <i>defined in clinical terms</i>, it can therefore only be diagnosed in persons who, at some point, are shown to meet those clinical terms. Ancillary investigations, such as CT scans, <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a>, EEGs, and lately <a href="../../../f/m/r/FMRI_756a.html" title="FMRI">fMRI</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positron_emission_tomography.html" title="Positron emission tomography">PET</a> scanning, may only provide support for the clinical impression—as might the pathologic findings, after death. In the case of Terri Schiavo, seven of the eight neurologists who examined her in her last years stated that she met the clinical criteria for PVS; the serial CT scans, EEGs, the one MRI, and finally, the pathologic findings, were consistent with that diagnosis.</p>
<p>The cause of the cardiac arrest which felled Schiavo 15 years before she died has never been determined. Aside from a localized, healed inflammation, the cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo's heart found it and the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_circulation.html" title="Coronary circulation">coronary vessels</a> to be healthy. Although it was widely speculated that Schiavo suffered from an eating disorder that caused a serious <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrolyte.html" title="Electrolyte">electrolyte</a> disturbance, stopping her heart, the autopsy itself showed little evidence to support this claim. The examiners also found no evidence that Schiavo had been the victim of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trauma.html" title="Trauma">trauma</a> or foul play.</p>
<p>Regarding the cause and manner of Schiavo’s death, Thogmartin wrote, "Mrs. Schiavo suffered severe anoxic brain injury. The cause of which [sic] cannot be determined with reasonable medical certainty. The manner of death will therefore be certified as undetermined."</p>

<p>During the final stages of the court battle in March 2005, around 30 individuals made a variety of complaints to the DCF, alleging various abuses. These included Terri supposedly being in pain from recent dental work, Terri not having had any dental work for years prior to that, and the blinds in her room not being open wide enough. DCF investigators found the claims to be groundless, stating that there were "no indicators" of abuse in any of the cases and concluding that "[t]he preponderance of the evidence shows that Michael Schiavo followed doctors' orders [regarding] Ms. Schiavo's diagnosis of being in a persistent vegetative state and that he provided her with appropriate care."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_DCF.NewsStory"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_DCF.NewsStory" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_test_0177.html#endnote_DCF.NewsStory" rel="nofollow">[72]</a></sup></span></p>
