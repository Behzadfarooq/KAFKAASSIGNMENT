Before, during, and immediately after the album's commercially successful release, he toured again, sometimes in battle against his now highly promoted image. Financial success was short-lived, however, as he was soon plunged into legal battles with his former manager and enjoined from further recording. Again he toured to make a living, long after the conventional period of playing in connection with an album's release was over; only when his legal issues were finally resolved did he stop.

<p>During 1974, as in previous years, Springsteen was touring almost all the time. He had written the song "<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_%28song%29_130c.html" title="Born to Run (song)">Born to Run</a>" early in the year, and is known to have been playing it in concert by May if not earlier. Album futures "She's the One" and "<a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungleland.html" title="Jungleland">Jungleland</a>" were beginning to appear in <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_list.html" title="Set list">set lists</a>. But several events crystalized in the late summer of 1974. Springsteen played his last ever gig as an opening act on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>; after that, he would always be the headliner. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, he played his last show with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sancious_2e24.html" title="David Sancious">David Sancious</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest__Boom__Carter_fa99.html" title="Ernest &quot;Boom&quot; Carter">Ernest "Boom" Carter</a> in the band.</p>
<p><a name="New_Members_Tour" id="New_Members_Tour"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_tours_72fb.html" title="Edit section: New Members Tour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Members Tour</span></h3>
<p>There was over a month's break, then on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a> he played his first shows, at The Main Point in <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryn_Mawr%2C_Pennsylvania_a4fd.html" title="Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania">Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania</a>, with <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weinberg_f512.html" title="Max Weinberg">Max Weinberg</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Bittan_c0d0.html" title="Roy Bittan">Roy Bittan</a> in the band; these were also the first shows where the band was explicitly billed as the <a href="../../../e/_/s/E_Street_Band_ac23.html" title="E Street Band">E Street Band</a>. This was clearly a new beginning of sorts, and can denote the first of the Born to Run tours.</p>
<p>Violinist and stage foil <a href="../../../s/u/k/Suki_Lahav_1511.html" title="Suki Lahav">Suki Lahav</a> joined the band on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>. Shows were played up and down the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Coast_of_the_United_States_0292.html" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a> to help integrate the new members' sound into the band as well as to provide some income while recording sessions dragged on — finances were always tight and manager <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Appel_e385.html" title="Mike Appel">Mike Appel</a> often had to borrow money just to pay the road crew. An advanced, slightly different mix of "Born to Run" was given to certain <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock_%28radio_format%29.html" title="Progressive rock (radio format)">progressive rock radio</a> stations throughout November; it made an immediate impression and stimulated interest in Springsteen's first two albums and his concerts. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, another Main Point show was broadcast in its entirety by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>'s <a href="../../../w/m/m/WMMR_5990.html" title="WMMR">WMMR</a>; "<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Road_%28song%29_c8b7.html" title="Thunder Road (song)">Thunder Road</a>" made its first, work-in-progress appearance, and the (unusually long at the time) 2 hour 40 minute show overall is regarded as one of Springsteen's best ever. It was also frequently <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootlegged</a> soon thereafter, beginning a pattern that would extend for much of Springsteen's career.</p>
<p>This tour came to a close on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> after two shows in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Hall_f037.html" title="Constitution Hall">Constitution Hall</a>. It is thought that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Van_Zandt_6ec1.html" title="Steven Van Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a> appeared in both shows, but in any case it was the last appearances of Suki Lahav, who moved to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> soon thereafter.</p>

<p>The Born to Run Tour proper began more than a month ahead of the album's release date, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> at the Palace Theatre in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence%2C_Rhode_Island_49f3.html" title="Providence, Rhode Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>. Van Zandt was now a full-fledged member of the band. "<a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenth_Avenue_Freeze-Out_800b.html" title="Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>" made its first appearance, but the shows were still dominated by older material. Playing mostly the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeastern_United_States_099d.html" title="Northeastern United States">Northeast</a>, by early August "Backstreets" had appeared. A prolific songwriter at the time, other Springsteen originals would appear, be played for awhile, then disappear, never to make it onto any album.</p>
<p>Beginning on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a> was a key 5-night, 10-show stand at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bottom_Line_899f.html" title="The Bottom Line">The Bottom Line</a> club. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a> had put up posters of Springsteen around the city, the audience was heavy with press and music industry types, and an <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a> show was broadcast live by influential <a href="../../../w/n/e/WNEW-FM_05e4.html" title="WNEW-FM">WNEW-FM</a>. The shows were judged a success and further paved the way for Springsteen's big time emergence; many years later, <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> A similar 4-night, 6-show, high-profile stand was conducted beginning <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">October 16</a> at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Roxy_Theatre_e6d4.html" title="The Roxy Theatre">The Roxy</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>; in attendance were <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicholson_0c34.html" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Beatty_c7a4.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a>, <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_O%27Neal_0014.html" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carole_King_e70e.html" title="Carole King">Carole King</a>, as well as various entertainment industry executives. By <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_27.html" title="October 27">October 27</a> the publicity push had reached its climax and Springsteen was on the covers of both <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i>.</p>
<p>This tour ended with a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Eve_e542.html" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> show at the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Theatre_a486.html" title="Tower Theatre">Tower Theatre</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_tours_72fb.html" title="Edit section: European Tour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">European Tour</span></h4>
<p>However, during the previous month, Springsteen had made his first very brief foray into <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>, playing <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammersmith_Odeon_06c3.html" title="Hammersmith Odeon">Hammersmith Odeon</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. It did not go too well, as Springsteen famously had a meltdown when he saw a lot of hyped-up Columbia Records publicity for him everywhere in London. The performance was captured on film that night, and Springsteen was clearly bothered and kept fussing with a too-large stocking cap on his head. Single shows in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> followed, capped by a return to the Hammersmith on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>. Chastened, Springsteen would not return to Europe for six years. (Ironically, by the 1990s and 2000s Europe would become Springsteen's strongest and most loyal fan base.)</p>
<p><a name="Chicken_Scratch_Tour" id="Chicken_Scratch_Tour"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_tours_72fb.html" title="Edit section: Chicken Scratch Tour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chicken Scratch Tour</span></h3>
<p>This colorfully-named tour began on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>; the official 1984 Springsteen chronology would state of that date, "The fabled 'Chicken Scratch Tour' begins, taking Springsteen and E Streeters on an extremely meandering route through the south, midwest, and northeast United States." The name was actually given by the band's road crew, due to many of the shows being in secondary (if that) markets in the South (such as for example <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Tennessee_State_University_4d52.html" title="East Tennessee State University">East Tennessee State University</a> in <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnson_City%2C_Tennessee_ab0c.html" title="Johnson City, Tennessee">Johnson City, Tennessee</a>).</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a> show in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a>' Ellis Auditorium, Springsteen decided to catch a taxi to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graceland.html" title="Graceland">Graceland</a>. Upon arrivial he had noticed a light on in the house and proceeded to jump the gates and walk to the front door. Security intervened at which point Springsteen asked if <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> was home, but the King was in fact in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Tahoe_c0c1.html" title="Lake Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a>. The guards not having any idea who this visitor was, even after Springsteen tried to explain it to them and state that he had been on the covers of <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>, politely escorted him to the street. Years later Springsteen would tell the story in concerts and reminisce about what he would have said to Elvis had he answered the door. <a href="http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/article_thenightspringsteenjumpedthefence.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/article_thenightspringsteenjumpedthefence.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Then, of this tour's end on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, the officially chronology stated: "Chicken Scratch Tour draws to a merciless conclusion with a show at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, which features a rousing version of Frankie Ford's 'Sea Cruise'."</p>
<p><a name="Interlude" id="Interlude"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_tours_72fb.html" title="Edit section: Interlude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interlude</span></h3>
<p>This likely would have been the end of touring until a new album was out. But during 1976 the relationship between Springsteen and his now former manager and producer, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Appel_e385.html" title="Mike Appel">Mike Appel</a>, had deteriorated, and during July Appel threatened action against Springsteen, Springsteen filed suit against Appel, and Appel countersued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in August Springsteen and the band played some local shows, mostly in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bank%2C_New_Jersey_85fe.html" title="Red Bank, New Jersey">Red Bank, New Jersey</a>, with the <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Horns_9ffb.html" title="Miami Horns">Miami Horns</a> on loan from <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southside_Johnny_and_the_Asbury_Jukes_4f6d.html" title="Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes">Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes</a>. New songs "Rendezvous" and "Something in the Night" were introduced; the former would become a hit for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Kihn_4a63.html" title="Greg Kihn">Greg Kihn</a> years later, while the latter, sans horns, would appear on Springsteen's next album, which he was all ready to start recording ...</p>
<p>Except that on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, the judge in the lawsuits case ruled that Springsteen was enjoined from any further recording with Columbia Records until Appel's suit was resolved.</p>

<p>Thus Springsteen had to hit the road again to have any source of income (as proceeds from <i>Born to Run</i> sales being tied up in various accounting disputes as well).</p>
<p>What the official Springsteen chronology called the U.S. Tour ran from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a> through <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, starting at the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_05ed.html" title="Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum">Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a> and ending with a six-night stand at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Palladium_2514.html" title="The Palladium">The Palladium</a> in New York. This tour was also with a horn section, also billed as the Miami Horns, but different from the previous group and unrelated to the Asbury Jukes. Along the way Springsteen played his first headlining shows in an <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena.html" title="Arena">arena</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wachovia_Spectrum_74be.html" title="Wachovia Spectrum">The Spectrum</a> in Philadelphia, but he used curtains to partition off part of the venue.</p>

<p>The court cases carried on, with battles being fought over various procedural rulings, and still Springsteen could not enter the studio. So back out he went, for a group of shows that the official chronology does not even attempt to label. This run began on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> at the Palace Theatre in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_New_York_1b4f.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</a>, and continued for 33 shows in the U.S. and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<p>By now Springsteen was quite dishearted, and before a <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a> show in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, he for the first time in his life did not want to get up on stage. "At that moment, I could see how people get into drinking or into drugs, because the one thing you want at a time like that is to be distracted--in a big way," he later told writer Robert Hilburn. Nonetheless, he rebounded, and eventually this run concluded on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> at <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Music_Hall_b683.html" title="Boston Music Hall">Boston Music Hall</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lawsuits had moved in the direct of settlement, and final settlement was reached on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. Springsteen entered the studio three days later to begin recording sessions for <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkness_on_the_Edge_of_Town_1a74.html" title="Darkness on the Edge of Town">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a></i>. The Born to Run tours were finally over.</p>

<p>It was during these tours that the Springsteen concert image took form. He had stopped wearing sunglasses on stage and was now more accessible. His baggy pants, T-shirt, worn leather jacket and sloppy headwear look was now offset by two frontline visual foils, as both saxophonist <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Clemons_186a.html" title="Clarence Clemons">Clarence Clemons</a> and guitarist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Van_Zandt_6ec1.html" title="Steven Van Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a> were stylishly dressed in suits and distinctive hats.</p>
<p>Musically, the E Street Band now had its fullest sound, with two keyboards and a saxophone augmenting two guitars and the usual bass and drums. Springsteen did not just play songs as they were on his records — they were often rearranged or extended with playful, poignant, or angry spoken narratives. Oldies from the early to mid 1960s were often brought in to supplement Springsteen's own material; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Animals_0e4d.html" title="The Animals">The Animals</a>' "<a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Life_%28Animals_song%29_c199.html" title="It's My Life (Animals song)">It's My Life</a>" was one such example, slowed down to try to increase the song's tension factor and preceded by what would become a Springsteen concert staple, the long bitter story about how he and his father did not get along at all with respect to the course Springsteen's life took as a teenager.</p>
<p>Springsteen's performances were also frenetic, with him jumping into crowds and singing on tables during the shows held in clubs.</p>
<p>Material from <i>Born to Run</i> grew in importance as the tour went on, but even the newest material could be quickly recast. Most notably, "<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Road_%28song%29_c8b7.html" title="Thunder Road (song)">Thunder Road</a>" was changed from the spirited, sweeping album version into a surprisingly quiet and pleading show opener, featuring Springsteen singing while standing still at the microphone stand, guitar slung behind him, with only <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Bittan_c0d0.html" title="Roy Bittan">Roy Bittan</a>'s piano and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Federici_d425.html" title="Danny Federici">Danny Federici</a>'s <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_glockenspiel.html" title="Electronic glockenspiel">electronic glockenspiel</a> accompanying him. (Producer <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Landau_dd36.html" title="Jon Landau">Jon Landau</a> later said that the stark presentation was partly due to the full band having trouble playing the album's arrangement.) "Backstreets" was augmented with a guitar line far more prominent than on record, while "Night", one of the least visible tracks on the album, became a show opener for a spell as well.</p>
<p>As the later tours took place and Springsteen became frustrated with his legal situation, the shows became his only outlet. Horn sections were added, songs further arranged, and more oldies pulled out. Performances sometimes reached the three- or four-hour mark. New material such as the bitter "The Promise" would appear out of nowhere, then disappear again.</p>

<p>The high-profile August 1975 Bottom Line shows won raves from music critics. <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> said that a star had been born and that "Springsteen is everything that has been claimed for him," while the E Street Band "may very well be the great American rock &amp; roll band." <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> said that the shows "will rank among the great rock experiences of those lucky enough to get in." Bottom Line co-owner Alan Pepper said that Springsteen "brought the house to a fever pitch again and again and again, and the band stayed with him all the way. It was absolutely amazing, and I mean that. In all my years in the music business, I have never seen anything like those performances."</p>
<p>Reaction was similar in other locations; <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> writer Robert Hilburn later stated that "the Born to Run shows were hailed in city after city as among the finest ever in rock."</p>

<p>In addition to the Main Point and Bottom Line shows already mentioned, the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> show at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Roxy_Theatre_e6d4.html" title="The Roxy Theatre">The Roxy</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> was broadcast live on <a href="../../../k/w/s/KWST_627c.html" title="KWST">KWST</a>. Springsteen also made some visits to radio stations during the tours in which interviews and performances were conducted.</p>
<p>The 1986 <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_1975-85_4a07.html" title="Live/1975-85">Live/1975-85</a></i> box set contained just one selection from any of the Born to Run tours, the "solo piano" (and electronic glockenspiel) "Thunder Road" taken from the following night's show at The Roxy. (The lack of further coverage of the tours was one reason for fans' dissatisfaction with the box set at the time; Springsteen management said the available recordings did not have good enough sound quality).</p>
<p>In 2005, as part of the <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Run_30th_Anniversary_Edition_667a.html" title="Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition">Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition</a></i> re-release package, a full-length concert film was assembled of the notorious <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammersmith_Odeon_06c3.html" title="Hammersmith Odeon">Hammersmith Odeon</a> show in London and included as a DVD.
