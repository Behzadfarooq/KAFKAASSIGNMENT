I can't see how it helps the article - I tried to imagine the dog described and could not (what's a shepherd dog?) and on the other hand there is a photo just inches away, which renders the description redundant, unlike in the other article which had no photo.

<p>I am sure Sannse is right about Lassie. Well, I don't actually know what a rough collie is, but I do agree that Lassie was certainly not a border collie - she was the pointy-nosed thing that lots of people just call "collie" and not the black+white thing you shout "away to me" and "come by" at on One Man And His Dog.&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 00:15 17 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Border collies *can* do well in the breed ring and also still have the energy and drive and intelligence of a working dog; I see them occasionally. It is *not* true that BCs make awful pets, also *not* true that the only reason to own or breed BCs is for working stock. I have adjusted the text to better reflect what I know about BCs (being around a lot of them all the time for many years). I have many friends with BCs who excel at <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_agility.html" title="Dog agility">dog agility</a>, many of them coming from "working lines" (which is also coming to mean BCs who aren't just pets or beauty queens but don't necessarily ever work stock), and all of them are pets and companions as well. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 23:16, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The UKC recognizes "varied lengths" for coats. AKC recognizes two, rough (med. coat) and smooth (short coat; may havae slight feathering), both with dense waterproof undercoats. ANKC says double coated with moderately long topcoat. All say BCs must be double-coated with short, sense waterproof undercoat. In practice, I've only seen med to long coats. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuill_7bcf.html" title="User:Quill">Quill</a> 11:26, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>[Quill shrugs] Not really. The ANKC breed standard (originating country) does not specify a weight. These are working dogs; the only specification is that they should not be 'overweight'. The USBCC says there is no standard, they are 'in general' a medium sized dog, 25-55 pounds--take your pick....</dd>

<p>Am I way off base, or is the black-and-white far and away the most common colour? Nothing against tris, which I happen to like. And how many links to clubs and forums do we need? WP is not a link repository, people keep telling me. We could use some cleanup. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuill_7bcf.html" title="User:Quill">Quill</a> 02:05, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh, I have no idea how to pare down the links. I don't really have a good idea which of all the registries are the key ones, but there are most assuredly 2 or 3 in the U.S. at least. Oh, yeah, and tris are OK, but blue merles take the cake.&#160;;-) I was at an agility trial a couple of months ago where a competitor asked me what breed my dog was, and I said BC, and they said they'd never seen or heard of a blue merle BC before--they were surprised when I was able to turn around and point out some others and name several additional ones in the area. Apparently they had never realized that they were BCs because they were blue merle &amp; not B&amp;W. I wonder how much that lack of knowledge or familiarity shapes "the common perception"? <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 03:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>"Conformation-bred dogs are seldom if ever seen on the sheepdog field trial." This after saying that they make terrible pets if not given a job seems incongruous.</p>
<p>"Breeding for 'beauty contests' has long been understood to water down this ability." Really? By whom? How long? For what reasons? How do beautiful herding dogs cope?</p>
<p>I think, perhaps, outlining the disagreement between conformation proponents and working proponents in a separate section and removing such comments from the body of the article would go a long way to objectifying the content. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 64.122.130.104 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.122.130.104_c432.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.122.130.104">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

This is no couch potato glamour queen.&#160;:-) (OK, I have no idea how she compares to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_dog.html" title="Show dog">show dogs</a>, but i've been told she has "good teeth".

<p>If no one has any major objections, I'm going to remove the "Smooth Coated Border Collie cross" picture.</p>
<p>It's a mixed breed that looks more Australian Cattle Dog than Border Collie. While it may be a popular Australian working dog mix -I can't confirm or contradict that statement - it really doesn't have much place in this article. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> (<a href="../../../c/m/a/User_talk%7ECMacMillan_280d.html" title="User talk:CMacMillan">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CMacMillan_65bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/CMacMillan">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I thought that it was possible to have a purebred smooth BC. Why is the picture of a cross even up there to begin with?</p>
<p>And as an aside, why are Border Terriers supposed to be the most suitable companions for BCs? Why not another high-energy herding breed? I'm curious here--I keep mostly terriers, not BCs.</p>

And you are right. The terms for these "yellow" BCs are gold, yellow, lemon. They all stem from the red BCs and then depends on breeding and genetics to determine the degree of the color. We have one that is peach and white. Very rare coloring.</p>
<p>There are also lilac border collies which technically comes from brown. I own a blue border collie which is dark grey.</p>

<p>Wow. I had heard that the AKC vs. ABC issue was huge, but I guess I didn't realize how much it would infiltrate nearly every edit.</p>
<p>"The many people who depend on the breed for their livelihood in managing livestock know that Border collies bred strictly to work are the best representatives of the original premier livestock working breed.

<p>and...</p>
<p>"However, many people who own Border Collies as pets and also compete with them in the wide variety of dog sports available to them prefer to have Border Collies who come from working lines, not show lines, because the intelligence, drive, and athleticism are preserved over a lush coat or standard size and weight. The future shape of this breed is still very much in question and is largely dependant on whether working breeders will accept being marginalized or whether they can educate people to appreciate the breed for what it really is, a premier livestock working dog."</p>
<p>A little POV there? Sources maybe? "Many people who own ... prefer to have Border Collies who come from working lines..."? Really? Not that I've experienced but I could easily be wrong. Again, source?</p>
<p>C'mon people, we can do better than that and still give weight to the AKC vs. ABC issue. Try to see the sides and it might help with the POV. If I said "Many breeders believe that breeding strictly working dogs is responsible for the widespread Border Collie Eye Anomoly defect, as well as predisposition for seizures and IMHA" would you see the POV more clearly? -<a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 17:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep. Need some numbers and facts here rather than unsupported opinion. Too many weasel words and a lack of a nuetral position in this section. Trial results here in Australia show that both pedigreed ANKC and other BC's are used in agility competition. It should be possible to get some actual numbers for the various dog sports for various codes showing what type of dogs are running in the events. As a random sample I looked at results for a trial in West Australia and saw 9 ANKC purebred dogs (one a show champion) and 4 associate non-purebred dogs had qualifying runs. This does not necessarily mean that most Austrlalian competitors prefer ANKC registered dogs or that purebred dogs are better than non-purebred dogs. Figures simply show what dogs are currently used, so they can help people form their own opinion. I'm not sure of the situation in other countries, but it's also worth remembering that people breeding dogs under a certain registry are not necessarily breeding 'show dogs' anyway. Breeders also breed specifically for performance events as well. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBcsr4ever_d228.html" title="User:Bcsr4ever">Bcsr4ever</a> 23:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cut the two paras:</p>
<p>"Some people believe that the emphasis placed on appearance might ruin the breed for its traditional livestock work because breeding for appearance eliminates emphasis on intelligence and working ability. Others believe that, in today's world, where livestock work is uncommon, the beauty of the breed is the factor that should be preserved. The many people who depend on the breed for their livelihood in managing livestock know that Border collies bred strictly to work are the best representatives of the original premier livestock working breed. Breeding for "beauty contests" has long been understood to water down this ability."</p>
<p>"However, many people who own Border Collies as pets and also compete with them in the wide variety of dog sports available to them prefer to have Border Collies who come from working lines, not show lines, because the intelligence, drive, and athleticism are preserved over a lush coat or standard size and weight.

<dd>Perhaps the argument deserves an article on its own? I don't necessarily disagree with the theory given what AKC judging has done to German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Labradors in particular, but I don't believe that both sides are right either. AKC judges have a lot to answer for when you see Shepherds that can barely walk on twisted hind legs and Labs with unhealthy weight. What I do believe is that it has a place in mention on the Border Collie page, just not this pervasive thread running through every paragraph! What about other countries, by the way? The CKC in Canada doesn't recognize the breed - eliminating it from agility (foolishly in my view). What about Australia and Great Britain who have so much more claim to the working breed? --<a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 03:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As with other working breeds, a division exists between registries promoting working ability and those promoting a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conformation_point.html" title="Conformation point">conformation</a> <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breed_standard.html" title="Breed standard">breed standard</a> with accusations that breeding to a conformation standard will diminish the role of the breed in traditional livestock work since does not concetrate on intelligence and working ability.

<dd>And then maybe point that to a separate article as suggested. This problem is not just with the BC, but with kelpies and other working breeds. As for Australia, there are working dogs and show dogs, but show dogs dominate as far as any registry goes. Farmers just have some dogs. For many years only purebred ANKC dogs could compete in ANKC dog sports (and that was the only game for a long time) in my state, so when we started in dog sports we selected and bred performance dogs (and working dogs) from ANKC lines. We use those dogs on a working cattle property and they do well if selected and bred for work, but generally the show dogs are bred for a quiet nature and way too fluffy coat. These days people do just breed ANKC dogs for performance (agility, etc) and they are less fluffy and more active, and of course many are bred (badly) just for the pet market, which is probably the worst thing for any working breed (or any breed). Anyway, now all states in Australia allow non-pedigree dogs to enter, so there are more of the non-fluffy and working types... --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBcsr4ever_d228.html" title="User:Bcsr4ever">Bcsr4ever</a> 07:15, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a note on changing the wording for the entry on Canadian Border Collie Association registry. The line originally noted that registration was based on herding ability. As with conformation registries and others registration is based on sire and dam registry with the association and has nothing to do with ability.

<p>I know this isn't exactly the right forum in which to bring this up, but I am not very familiar with the Wikipedia policy regarding GDFL violations for other websites copying Wikipedia material without reference, nor have I personally contributed any of the material on this page which has been copied. However, I found during some web browsing on dog breeds that the site <a href="http://www.dogbreedadvice.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dogbreedadvice.com" rel="nofollow">www.dogbreedadvice.com</a> appears to have copied a great deal of information from this page and pages on other dog breeds, without noticeable attribution to Wikipedia.

This is of course a violation of the GFDL, and also does a disservice to the hardworking Wikipedians who brought this article up to a high enough standard that it has become worth copying. (Yay, they're copying us! Boo, they're not giving us credit!) I'm sure a polite note to the administrators of that site advising them to provide a link to the source of their material would be sufficient, but, as I said, I'm not really sure about the standard operating procedure here, so I'd like to request that a more experienced Wikipedian than I take the case. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_93c1.html" title="User:Geoff">Geoff</a> 08:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are several places where it is stated that the very sad but too common lack of mental and physical training of border collies can be alleviated by having two dogs. It may just be me, but it seems it has been put into the sentences after they were written. That is the first concern, the second is my opinion that this is incorrect, that if you do not have the time for one border collie, getting another is not going to help. But my opinion is worthless, as this needs to be referenced. So I am planning on removing the statements about the second dog, unless some reasonable references can be found. <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">mceder</a> (<a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">u</a> <a href="../../../m/c/e/User_talk%7EMceder_b9e9.html" title="User talk:Mceder">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mceder_ec10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mceder">c</a>) 17:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
