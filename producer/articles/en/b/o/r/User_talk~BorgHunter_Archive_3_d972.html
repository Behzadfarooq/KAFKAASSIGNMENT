<p>I don't appreciate you stating on the Administrator Notice Board that RJII has "disrupted nearly every article he has touched, including ANI." It's not true. Take a look at all the articles I've worked on. If there's a disruption, it's a good disruption, brought on by bringing in sourced information that the status quo doesn't like. The best thing about Wikipedia is that it's a way for the mainstream to have access to information that in the past has had to pass through filters and expurgated of anything that might challenge the establishment. What we have here is the indoctrinated victims of the establishment trying to supress information that I bring to the table, by any means necessary, including filing arbitration cases. They panic because it conflicts with the false reality they've been living with --I bring in information and intelligence that was not in their textbooks. I'm appalled that you and other administrators would condemn me for defending myself against false charges on the Notice Boards. I'm equally appalled that you would fall for the false claims from "infinity" that brought you to ban me for two weeks from an article. You arbitrators need to wake up and realize your main purpose --to keep verifiable information from being suppressed. With a few exceptions, you guys are doing an abysmal job as a whole. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:59, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great to see someone else with energy taking up the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Institute_of_Technology_7656.html" title="Illinois Institute of Technology">IIT</a> page. Getting to featured page status would rock. As you can tell, I did a ton of work around Christmas getting the page into a much better state, but am pretty swamped at the moment so it'll be summer before I have a good deal of time to devote to side projects like this. On another note, I've floated the idea, after seeing success with the page here, of building a wiki entirely for IIT. I've seen some other schools do wikis, but haven't been too terribly impressed with the ones I've seen. A wiki that is used by everyone could form a giant fact base, yearbook, student/staff/faculty/organization/alumni directory, and more all in one. Initial support seems to be there from the right people, it's just a matter of getting things set up, setting a good system of templates, and having enough initial time to populate the basics to get everyone interested. Anyway, thought since you're obviously into wikis you might be interested in taking part or helping out in the fall - just email me at my staff address if you are: duncanr@iit.edu -<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanr_32e7.html" title="User:Duncanr">Duncanr</a> 05:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey BorgHunter,</p>
<p>I'm really ok either way here, but I wanted to make sure you were aware of the issue: Theodore7 had several days left on the one-week block I gave him (apparently uncontroversially) for violating his personal attack parole. If you feel the arrangement you've come to regarding the legal threats is best served by leaving him immediately unblocked though, I'd understand that -- though perhaps I'd ask you to attempt to impress on him that he is still under the various arbcom paroles, if you have not done so already.

<dd>Right, well, we have talked through email. I unblocked him with the understanding that he would cease not only the legal issues, but the rest of the undesirable behavior as well. I can forward you that email if you want.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speedy deletion</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You speedy-deleted the "Allah-kitten controversy" page. At the time you did so, the deletion discussion was unanimous that it the page was a hoax.</p>
<p>Hoaxes are specifically excluded from the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, which you must realize, as you mentioned deletion criterion A3 in your edit summary. Unfortunately, A3 does not apply to hoaxes either.</p>
<p>I think this kind of speedy is a bad idea. Once the article has come to AfD, it makes little difference whether it is deleted now or 5 days from now; and these kind of irregularities call the credibility of the deletion process into question, especially during contentious AfDs during which unhappy people can point to prior violations of policy as precedent for assuming the deletion process is flawed and unfair.</p>
<p>I'd like to request undeletion of the page and unclosing of the AfD, then, on the grounds of <a href="../../../p/i/_/WP%7EPI_8430.html" title="WP:PI">WP:PI</a>.</p>

<p>Ditto for Charles "Chaz" Miller. You summarized the page deletion reason as "CSD A7, nonnotable." Non-notability is not a criteria for speedy deletion. Failure to assert notability is, and the AfD nomination very clearly points out that notability was asserted. Community consensus - in the form of the Wikipedia deletion policy - is important on Wikipedia. Please consider reviewing the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>, undeleting the article, and reopening the AfD. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 01:59, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alrighty. The first, I had meant G3, not A3, which was my mistake. Vandalism. I assume good faith all the time, but the kinds of edits that user was making proved bad faith to me, and so I deleted that as G3 and potentially as a subset of A7 on the Chaz Miller page. The second <i>is</i> a speedy category, specifically, A7: "<b>Unremarkable people or groups.</b> An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead." Please also note that, at the time I speedied the articles, the AfDs were 100% delete save the article creator. In addition, calling these speedies contentious is beyond ridiculous: I deleted them in line with the speedy criteria, but also per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and, yes, <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>.

<p>If Durin had firstly asked politely to remove the fair use images from my userpage without barging in and editing at free will I would not have reverted his edits. Also, if you had asked politely I would have stopped adding them. Since I'm now being forced, because nobody around here can simply <b>ask things like any normal human being</b>, I am <b>agreeing to stop adding the fair use images</b>. Thank for your time and I expect my user page to be unblocked as soon as possible. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 14:08, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>BorgHunter; since he agreed to stop using fair use images on his userpage, I have unprotected it. Thanks for your input on the matter. If he continues to insert such images on his userpage, I will not take direct action but refer it to other admins for review. Any continued efforts on my part with regards to removing these images from his userpage will just be fuel for the fire, so its best if I just refer it on in his case from now forward. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the note. I issued that account an indef block and further blocked Zeus69962 for disruption (24 hours). I hope he'll soon realize that his socks couldn't fool a bacteriophage, much less intelligent people already on the lookout for socks. I'm doubling his block for every new sock we find, too. The sad thing is, he could be right, for all I know...I haven't so much as looked at the dispute on the Frank Herbert page, and moreover, I don't care to. That sort of disruptive sockpuppeteering is just plain annoying.

<p>Seriously, how are we supposed to DISCUSS on Talk-Pages, when my very arguments there are being vandalised. Still, some still dispute my arguments for being "false quotes", but when I back them up with FULL REFERENCES, my edit is repeatedly reverted.

<p>Borghunter, you have not examined the discussion yet saw it necessary to revert my move. I take your accusation of vandalism very seriously.

<dd>They're annoyed, fine. This means that there's a conflict of interest, and it is <i>not appropriate for them to remove comments on the basis of alleged "trolling"</i>. I further have not accused you of vandalism, even going so far as to post a note on your talk page saying as much, "though I know your intent was to avoid [disruption]." Your revert was in good faith but was generally a bad idea. Please avoid removing talk page comments under the "trolling clause" when you admit being "annoyed," as that very much does not suit an editor on Wikipedia, much less an admin. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 16:10, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism again!</span></h2>
<p>Hi BorgHunter! how are you? I hope you don't mind me seeking your advice again, regarding the same Talk Page.</p>
<p>It Seems like some user has distressfully distorted my comments on a TALK PAGE. As you may observe, not only were my links REMOVED, but even the very REFERENCES - which was the all purpose of my comments - (given allegation of "fabrication" and "false quotes"), were to disappear, leaving the impression of my edit as another long tedious boring list of SOME ALLEGED quotes (without any means for verification) which have already been cited just a few lines above. I find this revert as pure distortion, as he mysteriously "hided" the major lines in my comments.</p>
<p>Finally, the revert was applied without any notification, and I got it only in some miraculous way, which is again very disturbing. Would you be so kind to look into the matter, please. sure I wish to revert that section again to my edit. Thanks in advance!

<p>Dear BorgHunter,</p>
<p>I liked reading your philosophy for being a Wiki advocate. Please help me. I started to put a short bio about myself on Wikipedia and made a terrible mistake. I cut and pasted the bio from my website into Wikipedia. My intention was the edit from Wikipedia, but before you know it this big scary COPYRIGHT sign went up and prevented me from doing anything. Evidently I am "under investigation."</p>
<p>The page said I could write my entry "from scratch" on a Temp page (see it by putting in "Sharon Dotson"), which I did, but I am still in no man's land.</p>
<p>Could you be my advocate and get this removed? I didn't mean to commit a grievous error -- and by the way this was my own copywrited material. BNut you better believe I will never cut and paste any material to Wikipedia ever, ever, ever again.</p>
<p>Would appreciate hearing from you. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Nope. When you subst it, the size of the database increases because suddenly the article goes from 12 bytes to a few hundred, defeating hte purpose of deletedpage. Embedding it keeps the database small. Subst should ONLY be used for high-traffic articles, or articles that people are likely to visit at least more than once. Most of the deletedpage items are super low traffic, so you're actually wasting a bunch of server space and slowing the DB down because there's more data to index. Please stop.

<dd>Because test templates are left on talk pages that could potentially be visited a bunch of times. {{deletedpage}} is used on pages that are unlikely to get any traffic. Glarg, you subst'd <u>all</u> of them? Sweet jesus.... well, I understand that you were trying to help but... crikey! Did you do it manually? Or with a bot? How many were there? A big disadvantage to casual substing is that nobody can update the template and have it reflect on the existing pages. Well, something to remember for the future!

<dd>That was all manually. No AWB, no bots. It looks like I did upwards of 300 of them, which I hope didn't screw anything up.

<p>Thanks for the advice, I have decided to withdraw my nomination and will probably re-nominate myself in a couple of months (unless I get nominated before then by someone else). <a href="../../../l/c/a/User%7ELcarsdata_582d.html" title="User:Lcarsdata">Lcarsdata</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/c/a/User_talk%7ELcarsdata_c894.html" title="User talk:Lcarsdata">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lcarsdata_0abd.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lcarsdata">@</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lcarsdata_b5ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lcarsdata">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_Adminship_662a.html#Lcarsdata" title="Wikipedia:Requests for Adminship">My RfA</a></sup> 15:28, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, my bad, and no, I didn't realize I'd made more than three reverts. I did figure I was reverting simple vandalism, though, since it was a link to a deleted page that the author was saying, in no uncertain terms in the edit summary, that he was reinserting it to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. I will try to be more cautious in the future, though, and thanks for the heads up. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:32, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
