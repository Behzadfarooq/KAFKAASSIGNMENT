<p>I found the following message when I tried to edit today "Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by BorgHunter for the following reason (see our blocking policy): "Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Pat8722". The reason given for Pat8722's block is: "Gaming of the three revert rule. It is not an entitlement; it is rather an electric fence" Your IP address is 72.131.49.76. I have never gamed the three revert rule, and am entitled to a statement as to the factual basis upon which it is alleged I did, considering that I was reverting unilateral reversions that were made without addressing the outstanding questions stated on the talk page.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 14:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your block has expired now, but I will indeed give you an explanation. You made 6 reverts in 24 and a half hours. That's textbook gaming of the 3RR rule. As for quote-unquote "unilateral" reversions, check your Request for Comment page. No one has agreed with your summary, but a number of people have agreed with the view opposing yours. I think you might be the one being unilateral here. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 15:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>[03]</b>Your "explanation" of the block requires some explanation. Do you know what a "unilateral" reversion is? I was myself reverting a unilateral reversion, so my reversion was permitted under the wiki 3rr rules governing unilateral reversions. So do you agree that blocked me for a non-3rr issue? A reversion is forbidden when the reversion doesn't address the unanswered questions and concerns outstanding on the talk page, particularly where the reversion being reverted by me has been frequently made in the past without addressing the outstanding questions and concerns. Reversions of such unilateral reversions are permitted, which is all I did. My second question to you is: Did you read the full <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">Talk:Libertarianism</a> page before you blocked me? My third question to you is, were you a past participant on any of the talk pages concerning these disputes? My fourth question is, are you an associate of any of those who have previously participated? Your block of me was entirely against wiki policy. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 17:06, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>[05]</b>No, its not over. Unless you acquaint yourself with wiki policy and what I did for which you blocked me, you are likely to do the same. Three reverts a day are permitted, when that is the only way to get those who are NOT seeking consensus (by their failing to answer the outstanding questions and concerns) to seek consensus (by answering the outstanding questions and concerns.) If you follow wiki policy, eventually the others will engage in meaningful debate and we will resolve the dispute, or they will "give up" and go elsewhere where they will do less harm. So please assure me that will not block me again for using my daily alottment of three reverts, until paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> are answered, as wiki policy required them to be.

<dd>Pat, I strongly urge you to stop this. You are not "allotted three reverts" during the course of the day, you are LIMITED to three reverts to prevent the exact same sort of revert-warring you are engaging in. Furthermore, you did violate the 3RR. BorgHunter legitimately blocked you for a short cool down period- after which you've chosen to violate Wikipedia's civility policy by calling him a "bully" and stating that "he is destroying wikipedia". You need to calm down and realize that you're not in the right here, and cool off a little. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 01:57, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>[07]</b>BorgHunter, when you added the minor "::" to my comments on your discussion page, you stated in the "edit summary" field the belligerent comment you should have stated in the discussion text, namely "Yes, the matter is closed. Mainly because I choose now to stop replying to it. Good day". That is not a rational response. You (and Daniel Davis above )are ignoring the KEY POINT, my reverts are ENTIREYLY CONSISTENT WITH ALL PRESENT WIKIPOLICY. It is those who revert my reverts WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING WIKIPOLICY. Consistent with the approach of consensus building, I have posed questions to the reverters, which they are merely ignoring, choosing to make the forbidden unilateral reverts, instead. Therefore they are the ones wiki policy requires you to warn and block, not me. The only reason for the blocks of me have been political and the result of "piling on", where the admins doing the warning and blocking have not actually looked at the facts to determine what has been going on, and who the policies should be enforced against. Three reverts a day of those who are unilaterally reverting my reversions, by failing to respond to the questions at paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> is ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH PRESENT WIKI POLICY? Do you agree that a response to relevant questions is a necessary part of consensus building, and that without it, "consensus" is just the forbidden "vote" <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">wikipedia: voting is evil</a>? I would like your assurance that you will NOT block me for three reverts a day on the Libertarianism page, until my questions at paragarphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> on its talk page are answered by those who do the reverts.</dd>

<dd><b>[09]</b>Please also answer the questions at paragraph <b>[03]</b> above, as you are looking like a classic bully admin who abuses his powers and should be stripped of that role. Is there any review process in wikipedia, for proposing that you be stripped of your admin powers for bullyism?<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 17:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Pat, sorry for the lack of response. Your comment got added at the same time as one by Mel Etitis below, and I looked at his without looking at yours first. I only noticed it when you added the paragraph numbers. My apologies.</dd>
<dd>You claim that I'm being a bully. Can you please provide evidence of this? If I seem that way to you, I apologize, this was never my intention. However, I would like to note that you have been tossing insults about on this talk page, such as "bully", and also suggesting that I be stripped of my sysop powers. If you plan, as stated in your edit summary, to make a complaint against me, these words will indeed come back to haunt you, and you may find yourself in hot water rather than the other way around. It is generally best, in a dispute, never to let your temper get the best of you, and to always follow <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for some of the rest, I see some misunderstandings of Wikipedia policy. "choosing to make the forbidden unilateral reverts", for example, is one. Reverts are not forbidden, as sometimes an editor or a group of editors may need to alter text that may not fit with other Wikipedia policies, such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Sometimes, reversions are the only way to make the text fit with such policies. It should not be taken as an attack on you or your prowess at editing articles. I further note that you make numerous references to consensus.

To me, consensus would seem to be clearly in favor of the group of editors rather than your side. In my mind, if an editor is truly concerned about consensus, he would not make a large a disputed change, such as yours, once, much less repeatedly, without a note on the talk page and discussion on the proposed wording. Revert wars, such as the one you entered into, do nothing to further Wikipedia's goals, and are extremely detrimental to the project, as it causes tempers to run hot and people to lose their cool. As I have no desire for such behavior to continue, I blocked you for twenty-four hours, attempting to give you and the other side a chance to cool down, as well as hopefully demonstrating to you that such behavior is unacceptable. Your response to my block has been argumentative and petty, which is unfortunate, as I don't think my message has gotten through to you. My main point, which I beg of you to understand and take to heart, is that <b>Revert wars are harmful to Wikipedia</b>. There is no leeway allowed on that rule, nor is there any discussion to be made. Such behavior does nothing but turn Wikipedia into a haven for bickering, arguing, and doesn't help write articles. I would suggest to you that you not make another revert to Libertarianism at all, and instead, that you try to strive for consensus on the talk page. Revert warriors, no matter their cause, are frowned upon here. Please do not continue such behavior. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 20:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>[13]</b>"Bully" is a perfectly good english language word. It means "to bluster or domineer" (New Webster's Dictionary, Westin FL, 2005). Admins who don't investigate before they block, who don't give explanations for their blocks, and who speak and act without checking the facts, meet the definition and need to be dealt with as such.</p>
<p><b>[14]</b>"Ill-considered accusations of impropriety of one kind or another", such as you and the others have been making are what is defined as "incivil" [wp:civil].</p>
<p><b>[15]</b>Your latest problem as revealed above, is that you consider "voting" to establish "consensus". OF COURSE THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE (see wp:voting is evil and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wp%7Econsensus.html" title="Wp:consensus">wp:consensus</a>). If as an admin you still don't know so, that's more than one reason to eliminate you as an admin.</p>
<p><b>[16]</b>You also state "if an editor is truly concerned about consensus, he would not make a large a disputed change, such as yours, once, much less repeatedly, without a note on the talk page and discussion on the proposed wording". That is the whole point YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR MISSING - I DID make many comments on the talk page, and I have repeatedly provided the cites to it. I will do so again -,see paragraphs [113], [118], [224], [229], [231], and [235] on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk:libertarianism</a> page, which are still awaiting an answer so we can achieve consensus. You just keep proving you did not investigate before you blocked me, and that you have no interest in investigating to see if what you say is true. (Another major reason to eliminate you as an admin.)</p>
<p><b>[17]</b>You say you blocked me for making "unilateral reverts" (which I have never done). You have then given examples only of unilateral reverts you say are ok. As you unjustly blocked me for allegingly making "unilateral reverts", describe what you mean by <b>"the forbidden kind of unilateral reverts", as you have been asked to do.</b></p>
<p><b>[18]</b>Lastly, revert wars happen all the time in wikipedia, and sometimes they are the only way to get others to make an effort at achieving consensus - by encouraging them to respond to outstanding points on the talk page - the only real way to do it. (It's either that, or getting you to block them for their unilateral reverts -which do you prefer?) Your failure to answer the questions of paragraph <b>[03]</b> above, indicate you have something to hide. Combined with all of the above, you definitely should not be an admin. What is the procedure for accomplishing that? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 22:35, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not put words in my mouth; I've never suggested using voting to achieve consensus. I said that <i>discussion</i>, not voting, is necessary. Also, I am aware that you placed notes on the talk page; however, this does not excuse revert warring, which is <i>not</i> an acceptable method of editing, as you suggest. If you're making edits that are being reverted without discussion, follow <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. If there <i>is</i> discussion but the outcome is not in your favor, which is what I believe has happened...shoot for a compromise. Don't inflame tempers. I'd be glad to help you out in editing in this sort of fashion, if you wish—doing so creates a scenario in which people are far more willing to work with you. It also doesn't get you blocked under the 3RR.</dd>
<dd>If you wish more eyes to be on the situation (note that this is not a trial to get my sysop bit flipped), follow the steps on <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. That page states that if discussion has failed, <a href="../../../m/_/_/WP%7EM_4ddf.html" title="WP:M">mediation</a> or a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> is next. A RfC is less formal, more open, and I would heavily advise against this course of action in view of your own outstanding RfC which has shown relatively few users supporting your view. Mediation is currently fairly backlogged, and I doubt you could get through. I'd like to head off either course of action, though, so as not to create undue work for Wikipedia. Again, I'm not sure what you desire from me...could you please say so? I'm a pretty easygoing guy, and I'm not unwilling to make accomodations for you, within reason. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 22:56, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>[19]</b>It is clear that reversions of my edits were unilateral, not the result of "discussion", in that "discussion" must be two-sided, and my questions at paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page are still awaiting an answer.</p>
<p><b>[20]</b>If you believe that "discusssion" is what is necessary to resolve edit wars, then we have no dispute. You and I need only to come to a joint conclusion on how that is achieved. Mediation and Rfc's accomplished nothing, in that only the original parties and their associates, took part, consisting of the same unfounded accusations, the same failure to answer my points, and the same ongoing failure of their admin cronies to actually read the talk page to see what had actually happened.</p>
<p><b>[21]</b>Right now, the only thing keeping a "non-definition" on the Libertarian page is a "majority vote" being enforced by a couple strong-arm admins, who haven't read the talk page and who don't respond to the points I raise in objecting to their block of me.</p>
<p><b>[22]</b>Discussion is necessary to achieve consensus, and discussion means "debate, examination" (New Webster's Dictionary, 2005, Westin FL), which requires the others to respond in the discussion, i.e. to answer paragarphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b>. As the only party being blocked is the only party willing to enage in discussion on the unresolved points, the problem of the wrongful blocking has got to addressed.</p>
<p><b>[23]</b>It is only because a cabal of editors have a couple of admin friends who they know will block me for reverting them, that keeps a "non-definition" and "false by implication" "definition" on the Libertarianism page, and which keeps them from participating in discussion. To my understanding, there are only two ways to encourage discussion (dispute resolution) with non-compliant parties under the wikipedia rules - doing three daily reverts and using blocking.</p>
<p><b>[24]</b>My three dailing reverts did finally begin to work, when Rehpotsirhc made an attempt to respond to my questions (insulting me in the process, but I don't mind as at least he responded) and to propose a compromise definition at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&amp;diff=49047925&amp;oldid=49037958</a>, but the others, knowing no attempt at consensus was necessary as long as they had strong-arm admins to enforce a mere majority vote, would not respond to efforts to parse that definition to see if it was the equivalent Rehpotsirhc believed it was, or whether it was an accurate definition if it was equivalent.</p>
<p><b>[25]</b>If the couple admins involved would just follow present wiki policy by allowing me my three reverts of unilateral reversion (or by blocking the unilateral reverters), the others will either engage in discussion (i.e. answer paragraphs <b>[113]</b>, <b>[118]</b>, <b>[224]</b>, <b>[229]</b>, <b>[231]</b>, and <b>[235]</b> on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page, such that the outstanding issues will be resolved, or they will go elsewhere where they will do less harm, and we will finally have a chance to put the definition of Libertarianism on the Libertarianism page, rather than the absolute nonsense they have there now, and which they know cannot survive discussion.</p>
<p><b>[26]</b>Since you are presently the primary obstacle standing in the way of achieving discussion (i.e. consensus building) on the outstanding points (paragarphs [113], [118], [224] [229], [231], and [235] on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page), and since you have been violating wiki policy in blocking me for using my three revert allotment to encourage consensus building (i.e. consensus-building through discussion on the talk page), and in failing to block the others for their unilateral reversions of me (in violation of 3rr, even though using less than 3 reverts a day) by failing to respond to the outstanding quetsions on the talk page (paragarphs [113], [118], [224] [229], [231], and [235]), the main problem right now to "how wikipedia is supposed to work" is you, and such as the one other admin who also blocked me without investigating ("piling on").

<dd>Well, ceasing to refer to the 3RR as giving you "an allotment of three reverts" is a good first step, because that is explicitly not so. Secondly, I encourage you not to edit war, and to discuss on the talk page. That's really about it; I don't wish to throw my hat into the ring on the Libertarianism dispute.

<p><b>[28]</b>No, not good enough. I DO have an allotment of three reverts a day, particularly where those reverts are NECESSARY to encourage the others to engage in discussion, there being no other means to achieve consensus. My use of reverts was ENTIRELY WITHING WIKI POLICY, and you know it. It's not like you don't like confrontation (blocking is a form of confrontation), it's that you don't like investigating before you confront, or engaging in discussion after you confront - you just like to use the bully power. Five votes, and two admin cronies to enforce it, have succeeded in keeping the definition of Libertarianism off the Libertarianism page - not the way wikipedia is supposed to work.

<dd>BorgHunter's exactly right here, Pat. You say, "I DO have an allotment of three reverts a day". But that's simply not the case. The point of 3RR is to stop edit wars in their tracks. This does not mean that it's the only way to stop edit wars -- just one of the quickest. Habitual edit warriors very quickly discover that 3 or even 2 reverts will get them blocked. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 16:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>[31]</b> Daily 3r's aren't prohibited, or there would be 1rr rule, not a 3rr rule, and because sometimes 3r's are the only way to encourage consensus building on the part of those who make unilateral reverts rather than engaging in discussion before they revert. Which has been my whole point on the Libertarianism page - how ELSE is there to encourage the others to respond to paragraphs [113], [118], [224] [229], [231], and [235] on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Talk%7ELibertarianism_e415.html" title="Talk:Libertarianism">talk: Libertarianism</a> page, unless we recognize that there IS an edit war going on, CAUSED BY THE UNILATERAL REVERTS OF FIVE EDITORS, not my 3r's. To suppress the innocent party in a revert war simply because they are "outnumbered" would totally destroy the foundation of wikipedia. You stopped the revert war by blocking the INNOCENT PARTY,by enforcing a mere vote (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">wikipedia: voting is evil</a>), rather than blocking the real offenders - those who are making unilateral reverts without responding to the outstanding questions. You say there is no procedure for stripping you of admin powers, but that seems unbelievable. Every rational system has way to strip those who abuse police power of police power, which is what the admin power is. If it is true that "Admins only become such when they have a decent understanding of wikpolicy" then you should know what such a basic procedure is. It will likely be awhile before I have time to adequately address your violations of wikipolicy before the wikipedia community, but I would at least like to get started, by checking out the procedure for stripping you of your admin powers. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat8722_a28f.html" title="User:Pat8722">pat8722</a> 17:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please read the link in my original edit summary, as well as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. It doesn't matter if you have permission to use it on your user page, Wikipedia policy is very very clear. Here's a quote of the relevant policy for you:
<dl>
<dd>"Fair use images should <b>only</b> be used in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. This is because it is the policy of the Wikimedia Foundation to allow an unfree image only if no free alternative exists and only if it significantly improves the article it is included on. All other uses, even if legal under the fair use clauses of copyright law, should be avoided to keep the use of unfree images to a minimum. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis if there is a broad consensus that doing so is necessary to the goal of creating a free encyclopedia (like the templates used as part of the Main Page)."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm surprised that, as a sysop, you were unaware of the policy, but I hope you're duly informed now. I shall remove the image one last time now; any further additions of unfree images to your userspace will result in a post on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. Thank you in advance for your understanding. If you wish to continue your use of the image, you could always ask your friend to license the image under the GFDL or rough equivalent.

<p>i've been an architect for years now, and this is the first i've seen of MiB and GiB. i gather from your comment on your modification on the intel core page that it is that Mi and Gi are to represent 2^20 and 2^30 respectively, whereas presumably M and G represent 10^6 and 10^9. what's Mi stand for then? if million, it should be the 10^6 that gets it, not 2^20. what might Gi stand for? Gillion?</p>
<p>in any case, in architecture itself, both in the academic literature and in industry, nobody ever refers to quantitites of memory as MiBs or GiBs, and it was confusing to see the core article using this largely unknown and arguably inaccurate terminology. i propose you or i shift it back, so that those who are familiar with architecture don't waste time figuring out what is going on here, and those who aren't don't start off learning terms which architects will not understand.</p>
<p>if you really want to distinguish between powers of 2 and 10, then do what some hd manufacturers do: say e.g. '10 thousand million bytes'. or do what all engineers and academics i know do: call them all MB and GB, understanding that there is a 2% difference, and in the rare case where it might matter, put a footnote saying, for example, 'we have assumed for simplicity that 1MB=10^6 bytes'</p>

<p>update: i've found the wikipedia article for <a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebibyte.html" title="Mebibyte">mebibyte</a>. given that's there, i propose changing at least the first reference to it on pages where this terminology is used to a link to this artice. i can't speak to whether it is a legitimate abbreviation or not -- wikipedia does tend to confer an imprimatur of authenticity on whatever it speaks -- but i do know that if anyone should be familiar with this terminology, it would be an architect, and i, an architect familiar with architecture literature, have never seen it.</p>
<p>perhaps when we are working with quantities of data such that for units 2^10k in common use, 2^(10*k) and 10^(3*k) diverge by more than a few percent, the literature will begin to change. but until then, it seems to me that MiB and GiB are distractions that should at least be clarified with links, if not just omitted as unecessary pedantry.</p>

<dd>I agree that the first instance of mebibyte and gibibyte in an article should be wikilinked. As for you not seeing it, it's a fairly new term, mainly because, yes, the difference between 1000 bytes and 1024 bytes is all of 24 bytes, a whopping 2.4% difference. As we move past hard drives measured in gigabytes into terabytes, though, it definitely begins to be noticeable and a problem. Personally, I think that it makes a lot more sense to use MiB instead of putting a footnote at the bottom saying "1MB = 1,048,576 bytes", especially considering that scientifically, Mega- means million. As for its being pedantry...is computer science a science, or isn't it? I sure hope so, otherwise the degree I want to get won't be worth much. Science should always be pedantic, and when it isn't is a cause for concern. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 01:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's both new AND it's stupid. But I don't dare speak up about how absolutely horrid it is for a commonly used scale like kilo, mega, giga tera to be ripped to pieces on account of a whole 24 bytes. Oh well.&#160;:P --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 01:57, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i will make a link of MiB wherever i see it. to address your other points, it is a balance between precision and accessibility. as the exponent grows, the divergence increases: between 2^20 and 10^6, it is 4.8%, between 2^30 and 10^9 7.3%, between 2^40 and 10^12 9.95%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>these differences are not inconsiderable, and it's clear they're trending upwards. however, the binary and decimal versions of relevant quantities in the forseeable future will clearly remain within an order of magnitude of one another, and that's really the key. having said this, let me make three points:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>whether decimal or binary units are being used is clear from the context. when applied to frequency, it is decimal; when applied to bulk storage it is generally decimal; when applied to physical or virtual memory it is binary. this specialisation of units is nothing new: when measuring iron, standard ounces are used; when measuring gold, the troy ounce, 4/3 of a standard ounce, is used. even in the US, in some pubs, beer is measured using the imperial pint, 570ml, while bottled water or milk is measured in the standard pint of 470ml. generally, the gold unit is called simply the ounce, the beer unit called simply the pint.</li>
<li>how important is this precision in the places we're seeing it used? for example, in processor specifications, the variance between 2^10k and 10^3k is a significant fraction of the difference in frequencies between components in the product line -- but, frequency comparison between different product lines is meaningless, and within a processor family, relative frequencies can be gauged without being aware of whether the GHz is a power of ten or of two. core frequency by itself is such an irrelevant value that AMD even marketed chips for years tagged with an 'intel-equivalent' frequency -- i once had an athlon '2000+' which ran at 1.6 GHz. this should show that the precise frequency is inconsequential, but even were precision meaningful, it wouldn't be relevant information for, i think, virtually all consumers. similarly, consider disk drive capacity. when the filesystem overhead and internal fragmentation can significantly affect the stated and actual capacity of a disk, a few percent aren't crucial. when thinking about network bandwidth, are you carefully subtracting all the tcp overhead?</li>
<li>computers are increasingly vital for effective living, and the steep learning curve already provides a barrier to many people. i argue that to the average consumr, the difference between 10^9 and 2^30 is not only irrelevant but not immediately comprehensible, and the presence of two terms seeming to fill the same void a serious distraction. think back, how many times have people told you that they have 120 gigs of memory on their system? how many times have you explained the difference between ram and fixed disk? overzealous precision can disenfranchise such people, who have made no mistake except for having other hobbies than studying computers.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>having said this, there are still certainly places where the difference is vital. the space probes which have crashed due to metric/standard confusion come to mind, and of course medical applications. so, a clear terminology should be available. should it, however, be ubiquitous?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>good luck to your degree ambitions. most of the year i am downstate from you at UIUC, perhaps i'll run into you sometime. --<a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamstar_56f8.html" title="User:Hamstar">hamstar</a> 18:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I need an advocate who will walk me through the medation application.</p>
<p>I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<p>I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.</p>
<p>I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of MWI</b></p>
<p>If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other unverses which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:</p>
<p>1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Coppenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Coppenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Coppenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, "God does not play dice with the universe."</p>
<p>2. It eliminates the "measurement problem."</p>
<p>3. It eliminates Von Neumann's "boundary problem": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: "Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects."</p>
<p>4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.</p>
<p>5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: "Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made."</p>
<p>6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, "[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery." David Deutcsh wrote: ". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment."</p>
<p>7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.</p>
<p>Based on the above advantages, it seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself[citation needed]. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle[citation needed].</p>

<p>This thing with the article was really frustrating. Bob Athayde is probably one of the most deserving people and I'm friends with the person who wrote the article and the guy who hosts the non-profit site it's on. I got permission from the author to copy it over and to use the photo, but then the site guy (now former friend) yanked the plug.</p>
<p>Question though- isn't anything created by someone technically copyrighted? FWIW the content was never published anywhere in print- only on stanleymusic.org.</p>
<p>One other question, how would I go about promoting a site like mine? Would you want to do double duty as an admin there too?

<dd>Yes, copyright is automatically created at the time of the piece's creation. It can, however, be reassigned to a publisher if that's in the contract. If it's not explicitly reassigned in some sort of contract, to my knowledge the copyright still lies with the original author and they, of course, can choose to alter the provisions of use of their works, including relicensing. For the record, IANAL, and I also don't want to be an admin anywhere else, but thanks for the offer.&#160;:) —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 18:59, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The site owner stated that they had no written contract nor even an agreement. So his rights are questionable. The site is run by a school and is non-commercial- there was no real reason for a contract, just content being written by someone who knows the material and being added to the site. He told me in email that she has the right to approve use of the content but he would hope she wouldn't.. so the content was removed anyway so as not to step on toes. I'm setting about creating a new article using the other as a reference. BTW- I removed the links to my site so as not to spam. Once you read this, feel free to yank the section from your page.

<p>Dear Borghunter, let me address the points raised on my talk page:</p>
<ul>
<li>"your edit summary had me extremely upset"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry to hear that, especially since it is based on a misunderstanding. My edit summary consisted of two parts: a) "revert substandard pov pushing" and b) "date warring" - the former referred not to your edit at all, but to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=61920537&amp;oldid=61877484" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=61920537&amp;oldid=61877484" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, which is substandard for many reasons. Only the latter wording refers to your making the dates consistent. If you were offended by the former, I am sorry for the misunderstanding (I might have made two separate edits), if by the second I am sorry about that too.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"And finally, some unsolicited advice: Pick your battles."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I pick my battles and this was none of them. I don't go around changing the dating format on other pages. In this case I only defended the status quo.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Does it really <i>matter</i> if the article uses "AD" or "BCE"? As long as it's consistent."</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, in the end it doesn't matter and WP policy rules that we should keep the original choice of the article. This always has been an "AD article", there is no reason to change this, and the only occurence of CE was in a passage currently warred over. There, the CE only appeared because another editor, who has been repeatedly admonished not to post it, disregarded that advise. I am sorry if his brazeness misled you into thinking that there was some inconsistency. To preclude that in the future, I have removed his insertion of CE.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope you understand this. So no hard feelings? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, kinda new to reporting problems so I just selection from the members list.

<p>Thanks for your note about removing attribution. Since having my images themselves "edited" by re-uploading the initial image while removing the attribution requirements and then having attributions removed from the articles themselves I have decided that the donation of my work in this manner does not suit my needs since all attribution quickly disappears. No doubt this also explains the extreme sparcity of decent images available here. I read through the guidelines quickly before I began contributing my work and apparently missed the statement that attribution would not be made each time the image or a derivative was used which I thought was clearly stipulated in the licensing agreement. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwightmccann_ba73.html" title="User:Dwightmccann">Dwightmccann</a> 05:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This guy keeps deleting my posts for a term that I use and a lot of others also use. I am unsure how to deal with it, and figured I could use a little help. The term is "needer" and we use it in our martial arts. I saw that you were obviously a trekie and figured you may be my best bet. Also, I did what the other guy requested but it seems that he just wants the term removed. What can I do?</p>

<p>This is an ongoing issue, which I doubt can be resolved now without further intervention. There's been a longstanding spam linking war within the various old time radio related article proponents. The most egregious abuses are in the area of self-promoting external links from both commercial and simply self-promoting sites. I've tried several times in the past six months to remove the hundreds of spam links IAW the Wikipedia Guidelines on external links, to no avail. No sooner do I remove them, then they're reverted by one or more Yahoo Group, OTRR Group, or commercial or self-promoting site owners themselves or their agents. Since they post anonymously, and libel and slander the messenger each time their spam links are removed, we're at an impasse regarding any kind of rational resolution.</p>
<p>It's become a fiasco, and won't be resolved unless someone weighs in to resolve these issues once and for all. The most egregious abusers are www.otrsite.com, www.freeotrshows.com, www.otr.net, and libsyn.com (libsyn.com has over 270 self-promoting links within Wikipedia any given day). To otrsite.com's credit, I'm acquainted with Jerry Haendiges and his unparalleled contributions to Golden Age Radio over the years from his site. I can't for one moment believe that he'd sit still for his site being used to spam on Wikipedia. Rather, I'm convinced it's simply either otrsite.com fans or others doing the spamming. Libsyn.com's motives are rather more naked. They're clearly using Wikipedia as a link farm to their benefit. As for freeotrshows.com and otr.net: I'm aware of their sites, and they do offer completely free golden age radio content, which is commendable, but commendable or not, the practice violates Wikipedia's External linking guidelines by being both self-promoting and self-serving.</p>
<p>If the easiest way to resolve this is just to declare any an all link spam abuse as acceptable within Wikipedia, then I'm more than prepared to abandon the effort. But if, in fact, the Wikipedia External Linking policy and guidelines should be enforced, then someone's going to have to either ban www.otrsite.com, libsyn.com, freeotrshows.com, otr.net, and the several others, who continually, through their agents, repeatedly revert link spam removals.</p>
<p>Your thoughts one way or the other? If I'm all wet, so be it. But if in fact I'm following Wikipedia's External linking policies--correctly, or incorrectly--I'd love to know one way or the other.

I'm not exactly a newbie, I've been quietly editing adding links and making stubs for nearly 2 years with very little trouble. But I ran into a particularly vindictive user over a dispute on the Mao unknown story pager and I've been afraid to use wikipedia for a while, since I fear he'll just jump on any edits I make as he already has. I did my to avoid going for outside help but now he has another guy helping him out. They tried to delete the Frank Hogan article I created without merit and now they're going after other articles I've wrote.</p>
<p>I began noticing between 2005-2006 the steady growth of Mao the Unknown story over wikipedia. While most historians acknowledge Mao's flaws that particular work has not been accepted by mainstream scholars and can best be described as pophistory with an extreme POV. I was disturbed when I saw how the Red Star Over China book had more devoted to the UK story's attacks on Edgar Snow than on the classic work itself. Hoping to promote a chnage I posted my objections on the talk page of Red Star and the talk page for unknown story. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> and me had a debate about the merits of the source at the talk page. I then noticed that shortly after our dispute <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> removed several links from China-related articles and from the People's Volunteer Army article. Initally I was willing to accept this as a coincidence, but when I discovered comments on the Red star Over China page I realized that <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> had pursued theese articles vindictively. When I saw his nomination for deltion on Frank Hogan a NYC prosecutor he knew nothing about and far out of his range of expertise I was outraged. Thankfully users with more knowledge about NYC backed me up basically ending the dispute.</p>
<p>However <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> rekindled the dispute after I made anedit to PVA. Initally I assumed that <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> was trying to help and was jsut upset by the way the dispute had dragged over into other pages. However his nomination to delete Frank Hogan was completeley unmerited as revealed by the results of the VFd. This dispute began in early October and I have done my best to solve this problem without requesting assitance, after the Frank Hogan debacle however I feel I have no other choice.</p>

<p>Johnsmith's bullying has made it very hard for me to contribute and I've made several important contributions to wikipedia including the 1911 encycliopedia, countless Victor Hugo articles and many military and political articles. Many of the stubs I have created have vbecome major articles. This all would have been impossible had Johnsmith's been immediateley there to remove any of my contributions! Please help</p>

Not to be a nag but since I've contacted you for help as an AMA my case has been moved from NEW to Pending which means I probaly won't be getting help from anyone else. I'd really appreaciate some feedback. I completely understand that you must be busy and everything, but like I've said earlier I've been completley unable to edit wikipedia. I have made countless minor improvements to wikipedia several of which have been wikied into major improvements and I'd had to ahave to abandonw wikipedia because of the vindictiveness of one user. So please help as soon as possible. Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>P.S. If you are busy and can't be of assitance I completley understand, but would appreciate if you would inform me since as long as my case remains in the pending status nobody but you can help me out.</p>

<p>Hi there BorgHunter,</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you remember or not. If not, the quick backgrounder is that I entered into a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Luckyluke_eea3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Luckyluke">Request for Adminship candicacy in January 2006</a>; and you were one of the editors that supported my run. At that time, the failure was arguably due to my inexperience indicated through my edit count. Since then, I have not been deterred from continuing to contribute to Wikipedia. At this time, I'm considering another candicacy - a little over one year from my last run. When you last supported me, you indicated that I could contact you for any future advice; well here I am. And the question goes, if you wouldn't you mind, can you please take a look at my Wiki-history and provide a brief overview of my potential this time around? If not, just let me know and that'll be fine too. Thanks for your time!&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 00:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
