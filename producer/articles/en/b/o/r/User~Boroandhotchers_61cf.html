<p>The Mancunian Candidate By Scott Oglesby</p>
<p>I am a boy with a history. I had a friend with a herstory. Then she died. Nevertheless I feel that history in general is semi important. I gives us a sense of identity, which apparently is important. Or at least is important to me. Or was important to me I don’t really if my feelings remain true to present. They are always changing and such. I am sure that you (the reader) are aware of these things called feelings. That is, if you (the reader) understand these words and they mean something to you. Not that people who don’t understand English or whatever this text may have been translated into are without feelings; what I mean is that anything that can oerceive any words as meaning, therefore doors and walls would be exempt from the understanding category. I suppose I could prattle onwards and upwards, indefinitely infinitely forever and such on such a matter, however I feel that this would detract from the esseence plot and stuff of my book. As a person who is able to read, I have discovered that when books commence with long digressing tanget passages about things trivial to the plot. I want to through the book into The Void, Avakúma, Kúma, the Outer Dark, the Eldest Dark, the Everlasting Dark, and such. And yes, that was a literary allusion to the works of tolkein. I created that allusion just for you. And yes, this is a work of literature (hopefully) that refers to itself. But like I was saying, I don’t like books that get off topic, which try to prove to the reader that the writer is a smart knowledgeable dilettante. I like books that stay on topic. And books that don’t fill me with rage. You see being full of rage is one of the things that shaped my life during the 1980s as a young bloke in England., which is where I lived during this time. I was doing my best to stay emotionally balanced but you know how these things can just sneak up on you. And I was pretty good at faking being normal during that time. But you know sometimes I let my guard down. You know why I am not very good at writing. 2 reasons, Actually 3 Actually I’ll write them first and after seeing all the reasons I will edit both numbers to say x many reasons. I think I’ll leave it that way. It is indie er. But the reasons I am not a good writer are. 1. Laziness. If people weren’t lazy the world would sucks so much. There wouldn’t be corruption or anything. I think. But then again people myself iclude naturally are bad vile evilfull people. Jesus and richard Dawkins agree. 2. This thing where I hear abunch of words in my head that don’t shut up that I have to filter out with a metaphorical reverse osmosis filter which is kind of annoying and makes me very anxious, and as uch as I want it to shut the expletive delted up, I enjoy it’s company.</p>
<p>(Digression) I want to got and lay in the grass and feel the autumn wind on my face. The grarant smells of the pavement and the fertilized grass. Okay off I go to delve into my story.</p>
<p>I will start with a vignette.</p>
<p>Cody was from Kentucky. And by that I mean he was from Tennessee. Tennessee is a state. It is a state in the United States. He moved to London immediately after he graduated from high school. High school is this thing people do. He was very underdeveloped and confused. He was addicted to heroin for a little bit. Then he went to a methadone clinic and got over it. But then he was addicted to methadone. Alas, you can’t have it all. So then, one time he moved to Manchester. This is where I lived. It isn’t where I always lived though. I was born in a hospital. I din’t live there that long. Although, I lived there longer than most, because I almost died a bunch of times, because I was pretty physically messed up in the first few months after my birth. I was never baptized. I was given Catholic Lat Rights by a priest so I wouldn’t go to purgatory with all the other unbaptized babies. But then in opposed to dying, I lived. (although it should be noted that my living is actually not a permanent characteristic of me since death is an inevitable fate which awaits us all.) So maybe I lucked out by living, but maybe being dead would be more fun. There were/are ceratinly times when I was dead. But I might as well live while I am alive since death is much longer. So, then I lived in Arlington, Massachusetts for a while. Then I moved. I moved to St. Catherines, Ontario. I was a foreigner in a foreign land. Fortuantely for me, I didn’t notice because I was three years old, and mostly intersted in other things. Namely, meteorology, seismology, volcanology, and living. So that was nice. Then I moved around a lot. I moved to Kenowa, Montreal, London (ontario), Talinnc finally Manchester in the United kingdom of great Britain and Northern Ireland. I was fourteen. And such. Well anyway, much like many of my peers, punk rock changed my life. Which is how I met Cody. Cody was in a band called Leger des Heils with a bunch of other cool dudes. It should be noted that I have recently ingested absinthe, which is why my writing may become incoherent.</p>
<p>But anyway Leger des Heils was a band, which was kind of a mix between Sham 69, the Damned, and Buzzcocks, and the Clash. It was comprised of Cody, his friend Brian, who was also from Tennessee, his GF 4lyfe Ruth, and Miller. Brain died from an AIDS related illness, Ruth died of a heroin overdose. Miller was at a gay bar and then some nazi punks came in and started bashing everyone’s heads in with baseball bats. They bashed the shit out of him until he died. And when he begged for mercy they did not renege on their plan. Well it serves him right, he was after all full of demons and God hated him anyway. This was in Portland Oregon. It is funny that he died in the U.S. because the is the only one who was from Great Britain. BF’ing. C’est la vie. Well that is the way the world was back then.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the story of when Cody, Brain and Me did mushrooms and listened to Blue Monday for hours, as we floated out of our bodies. Well tactually that is the story.</p>
<pre>
“I have always been afraid that no one understands me, and no one ever will”
</pre>
<p>What’s to understand, you are what you are and you do what you do. You are a very 1 dimensional person. There is no such thing as depth or complexity. It is aall the same base novels.</p>
<p>So one thing Inwas going to do was adapt this in the present tense using my journal entries from the era, but I am utterly incapably of writing in the rpesent tense. I just can’t do it, if I am thinking about it. But right now,, I can because I am not thinking about it. I am just too indolent for this. Shut up bed time. Shut up brain Shut down Open up.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.!</p>
<p><br />
2:34</p>
<p>Nevertheless. Here is chapter one. I am going to write it now. After a near melt down writing the introduction I took a spiritual retreat for meditation, so I could collect my thoughts.</p>
<p>Unfortuantely for you, I forgot what all those thoughts were.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 AKA the First Chapter AKA, the chapter that begins our story!!!! The sun shone on the scaterred bricks like bananas are blue, which is to say not at all. In other words, the brick walkway was in shambles, which was a sign of the decrepit decay of the inner city. If I were riding in a wheelchair I would hit one of the bricks, and then my wheelchair would capsize. Wheelchairs cannot cpasize though. I mean flip to one slide. Then drug addicts would come up to my hypothetical wheelchair and steel my hypothetical oxygen tanks, and do God knows what with them. Fortunately I was able bodied as I walked down this stretch of street. Although I was extremely fatigued and also was suffering from nausea, but I roughed it out, because I am a strong manly man. RARR! All around this street of loose bricks were apartment buildings three to four stories high. At the end of the bricks was the rochdale Canal. It was very nice. At the end of the street was the house of my friend George, who was initially friends with a female acquaintance of Cody, but he eventually grew to become a good friend of ours.. He invited me to play guitar with him. He was vey politcally minded. This is something along the lines of what he said to me. I have troubling remembering exactly. There are my wholes in my memory where I just blackout, which I assume is a result of Dragons Whisking me away to dragon fairy unicorn land, or excessive drug use. I would like to take this time right now to say that you should say no to drugs. If you say yes then you will randomly black out and then wake up and be like, “what just happened,” and you won’t know because you would have balcked out. So maybe this is what george told me, maybe this is a confabulations, but let’s just say this is what george told me.” The problem with kids these days is that they would rather blindly follow their leader without thinking for themselves. The only people who stand a chacne of listening are the nonconformist youth such as ourselves, but they are too busy listeing to bands like the Sex Pistols, instead of listening to anything with meaning.” “ I agree. What is the appeal of the Sex Pistols. What is the appeal of writing polemicist anti-everything pop music, if it doesn’t mean anything. This is just a bunch of ollocks. The Sex Pistols are manufactured shite that has no message or anthing accept, be a nonconformist like everyone else, get drunk, and make lots of money off of unintelligent youth.” Said I. “good thing they broke up, because they aren’t good. the way politics are headed it doesn’t seem like anything will become better. I mean the labour party knows what it is doing and the parliament has voted out the prim minister. James Callaghan has been robbed of his good position as the prime minister. And now it is going to be Margaret Thatcher. Her policies are not going ot help anyone except for yuppies in the home counties. It will cause more industry to close around this area until everything is closed. There are no factories or anything.” “Yeah,” I said., “I know what you mean. I mean, I can’t vote or anything, but I agree withyou. I really understand. Do you ever feel like everything Is overwhelming, an that ebing awake just makes you want to go to bed. Do you feel lie everything is out of control, and I can’t do anything about it. “Somewhat, but I have control over what happens to me. I am strong willed. I don’t have let small things get me down.”</p>
<pre>
At that moment, I man broke into the house.  He had a gun.  He demanded that we give him everything we have of value.  George informed him that we had nothing of value at all.  Then he said, “ None of this in my house means anything to me.  It is all-superfluous to what is really meaningful and necessary.  Then only thing of importance to me is the gray matter between my ears.”
</pre>
<p>Then the man with a gun said, “oh okay,” and he left. “See what I mean, “ George said, “people are good, and Margaret Thatcher and her conservative friends are going to impose a new set of laws which will force people like that home invader to invade homes to make money. This place is becoming like a ghost town. You know it is inherently bad to be a Conservative. Sure, a new definition could be added to give new meaning to be a Conservative, but from a logical, philosophical, and scientific stand point to be a Conservative, is to have flawed political iews. If values always stay the same, they cannot change. It is better to constantly reevalutate values and alw and change it that to conserve it for no one. Why should we be concerned about future generations , they can always chagne the lawas and such themselves. We have all this thought that we as a human race, as sapient Homo Sapiens are constanly adding and learning from. New discoveries will be made, and there should be adjustments to be made. Then I said, “I agree completely. In fact let’s start an Electro-clash band called the Conservatives.</p>
<p>So we did. We performed our first show at a house party. I played the guitar and he played the synhesizer/ drum machine and we charred vocals. We were very much into punk rock, and we remained very much into punk rock, but the scene we were in was evolving in unbelievable ways. It is not so much that we wanted to keep up with the scene, but that we were inspired by the new frontiers we were seeing. As much as we loved America Hardcore, we also loved the elegica ehteral minimalist sounds of Joy Division. We decided to emulate them a lot. However we stll wanted to maintain a new distinct sounds. George and I figured that the easiest way to do this was to stay true to us and not be molded into whatever the zeitgeist might be. After Cody was savagely beaten at a show in Coventry we asked him if she would be interested in playing the pedal steel in our band. He said yes. I was a sometimes member of Leger des Heils, so it was kind of like a cross over. Our first show was momentous. More people were at it that the first Sex Pistols show in 1976, or opening night of the Haceinda a few years later. It was July of 1979, and our songs were full of whatnot. Here is a brief summary of our set list. 1. “Western Union Paper clip Ice Cream Cover Bag” – this is a song that follows a chord progressions of root and the minor sixth in the verse, and then an inverse of the minor sixth and the root in the chorus. It slowly crescendoed until the bridge at which point there was a sick drum machine, autoprogrammed synth solo. In the middle of the song, everyone started dancing. 2. “No one lives here anymore” – A song that featured me playing dub-influenced ska styled rhythms on the guitar with Ruth playing the trumpet. Everyone started skanking during this song, it was very nice. 3. “Shakedown 1979” – this is a drum machine laden song about stuff. IT was stolen by the Smashing Pumpkins in 1995, for their album, melon collie and the infinite sadness. 4. “Love will break us up; art” – this song was voted by john peel as the greatest song of the year. There were more, but I don’t really think that was really important. Unfortunately no one remembered because the resident physician at the house accidentally gave everyone LSD twice, and pretty much everyone was freaking ou. The reported had no comment.</p>
<p>As 1979 came to a close the eighties were commencing. I spent that new Years eve on the Isle of Man. I camped, and slept throguh midnight. It was ncie though.</p>
<p>Then it was 1980. I kind of sort of was addicted to sniffing glue by May. Also I had become good friends with Ian Curtis of Joy division. Unfortunately, he commit suicide. Therefore he was dead. I walked through the mall, and no now was there., They were all sad about him.</p>
<p>At this time, all my friends were addicted to glue. Chapter 3 glue addiction. “I am addict…” haha you are a dick. “let me finish, I am addicted to glue sniffing,” I finally was able to say aftwer numerous interuptions from idiotic people like Cody. Hten I passed out. I don’t really remember the rest of that year, because Iwas busy being high on glue. SO it is a mystery. I also cannot go into the lurid details of my glue addiction. All I could do was just sniff more and more glue. I also listened to lots of American hardcore. I thought that was where it was at. Other than that, I did not really care about The US that much. I didnot follow Canadian politics., though. Here is an interesting lgue sniffing story. One time I was sniffing glue, and I realized that I was a glue sniffing addicted. I also realized I didn’t have enough glue, so I broke into the old marks and Spencer. When I could find the glue, I went to a violin factory and then got high off glue from the creation of violin bows. I really would like to warn everyone to not sniff glue. It wasn’t until a combination off factors that I stopped being addicted to glue. Namely, morrissey/.</p>
<p>It is all thanks to the zine, sniffin' glue.</p>
