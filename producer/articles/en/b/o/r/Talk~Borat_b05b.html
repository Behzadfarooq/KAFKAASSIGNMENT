<dd>I'm not super-familliar with the character, but it appears he is more commonly refered to as simply Borat.

<dd>A straw poll of my friends and workmates (about 40 people), all of whom know Borat and several of whom have seen the movie, reveals that not one of us knew his second name, or even recognised it given three options to choose from. We are far from a representative sample, being all from the same country for starters, but I'd agree with Jeff on this that Borat is his more common name, and the surname exists purely because he needs to have a surname and isn't commonly used or known. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastorquinn_f765.html" title="User:Castorquinn">CastorQuinn</a> 12:22, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Aren't they <i>both</i> usually referred to as simply "Borat"? I doubt that the vast majority of people familiar with Borat will remember his last name, and the character Borat is also currently more noteworthy than the film Borat, though this may change in the future if the film becomes so popular that a majority of people who know of Borat know of him from the movie (as opposed to from Da Ali G Show and other sources). At this point, at least, it seems like it's a bit more practical to have the character Borat at <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a> and the film Borat at <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat_%28film%29.html" title="Borat (film)">Borat (film)</a>.

<dd>Can someone please have a look at the extrenal links - it looks more like a myspace/youtube advertisers banner board than a set of links which add value/perpsective to an article!

<p>You are correct, I am new here and very keen to learn. As a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen I figured this was a good place to start. Please tell me how these three links are innapropriate? They are popular fan sites and surely should be included. --Shannonnights 14:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This still doesn't make sense. There are very few Borat fan sites, you can number them on one hand. They are BoratOnline.co.uk (already linked), Boyakasha.co.uk (removed) and BestofBorat.com (removed). I fail to see how leaving these sites out, while including links to a specific video on YouTube, or search results on other general sites is a useful service to readers. Shannonnights</p>

<p>In this following text I explain me feelings on the action of borar.</p>
<p>I watched a documentary on borat before I saw the film and thought to myself that is crazy no one would ever do that then put on sale for the population of the globe to watch but I was wronge.</p>
<p>These willing people took him into there homes and introduced him to there frineds then he sits there and make rude remarks to the family and friends, not to mention he come's back from the toilet with is waste in a bag for them to despose of.</p>
<p>I also the sense's of both borat and frineds(can't remember his name)doing such extreme bode action - Sure we live in modern times and there are some pretty out there things going on but you dont turn them into films. They should put it in the catergory as porn movies.</p>

<p>... do they do any debriefing? In social psychology experiments it would be considered a violation of ethics to allow people to think that they were responsible for being decieved by the experimenter for this exact reason. It can be really devastating and ruin lives, we learned that after the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milgram_experiment.html" title="Milgram experiment">Milgrim experiments</a>.

<p>In the text of the hoax victims area, there's a lot of info on this woman who claims she lost her job because of the Borat interview in a movie. According to the current article re:Borat from AP, she has provided two versions of this story: one where she was fired, and one where she left the station.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061113/ap_en_mo/film_borat_s_victims" class="external free" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061113/ap_en_mo/film_borat_s_victims" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061113/ap_en_mo/film_borat_s_victims</a></p>
<p>"Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the AP that she left the station."</p>
<p>Since this is a particularly damning example of the effects of Borat's methods, perhaps this entry should be tempered until all of the facts are in? 74.136.204.81 04:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The Associated Press reporter, Erin Carlson, had to recant that statement. She did a very stupid thing, using another reporter's original article as a source, without verifying the information. ANd HE got it wrong, so she continued misinformation. The producer in question has never stated on record that she was fired. She says in the letter to Newsweek that she was released from her contract early. The Fox reporter could not get hold of her and made up facts, apparently at random. He also said she was 50, when she is 35, and that she lives with her father, when she does not. I know this, because I am the producer in question. Also, the statement about curssory research is biased, inflammatory, and unfounded. It needs removal, immediately.</p>
<p>Gosh, I hope I followed all the rules of etiquette, here, so you won't simply discount this post and delete it, keeping the original misinformation intact. Again.</p>
<p>I don't understand this bit of the article.

<p>This was printed on eonline.com: SECURITY! Secret Service agents turning away Sacha Baron Cohen, in character as Kazakhstani reporter Borat, from the White House Thursday, after he showed up to invite "Premier George Walter Bush" to a screening of his new movie Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Unable to face the sting of rejection, Borat drowned his sorrows with several pints of horse urine.</p>

<p>Groups such as the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Defamation_League_5083.html" title="Anti-Defamation League">ADL</a> are asking, "is it really wise to make light of Anti-Semitism as this film does"? Cspalletta 12:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Borat" has extreme similarities with Yakov Smirnov's (broken English, sweeping generalizations about life in Eastern Europe, etc.) that I'm stunned Smirnov hasn't taken legal action against Cohen for the character. I'm just as shocked that nobody else seems to notice the similarities.If not Yakow Smirnov then take a look at Mahir Çağrı (A internet celebrity), the suit,moustache and broken english are extremely similar to Borat's. Luckily Mahir has taken some legal actions and is now asking Hollywood if he can have his own movie. Even in the light of his tacky and tasteless comedy, the most controversial and insulting aspect of "Borat" is that he's entirely devoid of originality. --<a href="../../../m/2E/n/User%7EM.Neko_20bb.html" title="User:M.Neko">M.Neko</a> 00:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I had to look up Yakov Smirnov to find out who he is (whereas Sacha Baron Cohen's characters are very well known: Ali G, Borat, "The Austrian Gay Reporter"). However, it seems the characters of Yakov Smirnov and Borat are very different. Looking at the Wikipedia article, Smirnoff makes short snappy stand-up jokes, Borat is about taking advantage of people's desire to be flexible with an alien culture.</li>

<p>There is already an (external) link to the WIRED Magazine interview where Mahir initially claimed he would sue Borat for stealing his persona. That set off a minor fire storm on blogs, websites, forums and a few mainstream media sites discussing those allegations.</p>
<p>And more recently the Associated Press picked up that lawsuit story too, so a TON of traditional news agencies have published it now - usually verbatim (ie. cnn, msnbc, cbc, etc).</p>
<p>None of them appear to have done any independent research to find out the merits of such a lawsuit, but a new online news site DID do some investigating and discovered fairly concrete origin dates for both Borat - or more specifically a Borat character by a different name and nationality - and Mahir's original website.</p>
<p>If there are any admins available to edit the Borat page, it might be worthwhile to add a link to that article JUST below the link to the original WIRED Magazine interview with Mahir, since the ENN article investigates the allegations raised by Mahir at that time...</p>

<p>Sasha Baron Cohen is now being sued by two college students which were supposed to have been made to believe that the movie will not be aired inside USA and that claim they were first put in a bar to get "tipsy" and then put in a trailer to pick up Borat.

<p>Kazachstan has mixed opinions on the character and although some would prefer to kill him, some support him and laugh with. The Kazach president gave a visit to George Bush, the day after Borat was standing outside the whitehouse, asking if he could leave a message for Bush. The president did not mention Borat although "The Times" published a 4 page article about Kazachstan and writing about how civilised the country really is.</p>
<p>YES, HIS CHARACTER IS NOT APPLICABLE TO A KAZAKH OR WHOEVER WHO LIVES IN KAZAKHSTAN&#160;!</p>
<p>"In November 2005, following Borat's hosting of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry voiced their concerns about the character.

<p>I think there are still lots of people that will want to start legal actions against Cohen. Pamela Andersson has not responded to media yet about how she feels about the situation. The person responsible for inviting Borat for an interview in the live news channel has lost her job and I think will soon try and sue him, but we can't forget, this is 20th Century FOX.</p>
<p>at footnote twenty in the "hoax victims" section it states that certain parties decided "not to press charges." however, "charges" is a word that is only relevant to criminal proceedings. in civil matters (i.e. those brought by private parties) plaintiffs make "claims" or have "causes of action."</p>

<p>It may be a random line from the movie but when Borat is asked about religion he says, as stated above, that "I follow the way of the hawk." It would be good to update the main page to correct "eagle" to "hawk." (UTC)</p>
<p>He is talking about the Hawk/Eagle/Whatever on the Kazakh flag! See: The golden eagle is associated with the empire of Genghis Khan, who ruled Kazakhstan under a blue banner with such an eagle on it; thus, it is a reminder of the proud history of the people who form the modern nation of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember seeing one of Borat's interviews from the Borat TV show where one of the interviewees was Christian and Borat congratualted them for it, possibly reflecting that he is a Christian. I realise that is a very vague piece of information for the moment, but if we could find that interview and confirm it then we could put that in the article. EJB341 15:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, at the end of the film, Borat says he and his entire village have converted to Christianity, but I was talking about before this film. - <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikB_be8e.html" title="User:ErikB">ErikB</a> 17:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Alternatively, its entirely possible that Borat is both a caricature <b>and</b> a satire? A satirical caricature? I think its important to include the satire reference though, its the fact that its blatantly satirical that stops the characters from being blatantly racist and offensive. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 23:43, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The satire comes out of the responses he gets from people. The caricature is the overplayed ignorance of the foreigner. "Satirical interviews" is correct, but Borat himself is a caricature.

<li>Agreed. Borat is a caricature for the purpose of satire.--210.241.95.245 11:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Changed caricature to character. Caricatures only refer to the type of artwork/cartoon, not live people (regardless if they are ficitonal or not). NO MATTER, NOBODY KNOW WHO IS BORAT IN KAZAKHSTAN, BUT HE IS SERVING TO ADVERTISE MY COUNTRY TO PUBLIC MAINLY TO THE US, IT IS GOOD BUT HE BETTER NOT, NO ONE STATEMENT IN HIS ASSESSMENT IF TRUTH, HE REMIND ME PEACE CORP.

<p>Borat being from kazakhstan is irrelevant. He may as well be from elbonia (mah). He is a character designed to be from "backwards eastern country" used to make fun of westerners and their ignorance, be they UK drama students or American farmers. He is satire that happens to make use of a caricature of a man from the eastern block (blok?). <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWookMuff_6818.html" title="User:WookMuff">WookMuff</a> 03:10, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article makes extensive use of "Kazakhstani" as an adjective. Isn't "Kazakh" correct? Or does "Kazakh" denote only someone from the Kazakh ethnic group, while "Kazakhstani" can be anyone or thing associated with the country?</p>

<dd>If you read on the <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakhstan.html" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> page, you'll see that Kazakh refers to the members of the Kazakh ethnic group, whereas Kazakhstani means everyone from Kazakhstan. Until Borat comes out and says he's specifically of Kazakh descent, Kazakhstani is the only way to refer to him. Dave420 12:23, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Kazakhstani" is meaningless, despite the firm authority of the Kazakstan page--Kazakh is correct in all adjectival references as a national reference, not simply ethnic. It's feeding into the ignorance that Borat preys/plays upon to pretend there is such a word as "Kazakhstani." While other nationalities simply append the "i" suffix, Kazakhs do not.</p>
<p>e.g.: People from England speak English; they are frequently of the English ethnic group; they live in English houses and use standard written English, sometimes while drinking English tea. There is no special "English" ethnic group denotation with an "Englishtani" tea or "Englishstani" cars.</p>
<p>In the movie, Borat seems to refer to people or elements of society from his country as "Kazakhi." Given the celebrated dissimilarity between Borat's Kazakhstan and the actual Kazakhstan, it may be best to go with that term. <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdiotkid_272e.html" title="User:Idiotkid">Idiotkid</a> 01:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I suggest you check with your nearest dictionary? They don't agree with you: Kazakh: "1. a member of a nomadic Muslim people living mainly in Kazakhstan. 2. the Turkic language of the Kazakh people." and Kazakhstani: "adj&#160;: of or pertaining to Kazakhstan or to the Kazakhs or their culture [syn: Kazakhstani] n&#160;: a native or inhabitant of Kazakhstan".Dave420 10:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kazahk is a specific ehtnic group located within Kazakstan, however not eveybody within the country is a Kazack:</p>
<p><i>The majority of modern Kazakhstanis are currently either ethnic Kazakhs (58%) or Russians (27%), with smaller Ukrainian, Uzbek, German, Korean, Uyghur and other minorities (15%). Main religious groupings are Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.</i></p>
<p>Therefore it is possible Borat is of Russian acestry or Ukaranian etc. which would actually more fit his physical appearance.</p>
<p>Borat should be refered to as <b>Kazakhstani</b> instead as Kazahk, becuase to my knowledge he has never refered to himself as a Kazahk, not to mention he is generally refered to by other's as a Kazakhstani journalist, please correct me if im wrong. -Brodey</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT RIGHT THERE IS NO WORD LIKE KAZAHK(???) MAY MAYBE REFERRED TO KAZAKH? KAZAKH IS THE MAIN AND TITLE ETHNICITY THERE, HE IS NOT KAZAKH HE IS JEW )))</p>
<p>As we all know Sacha Baron Cohen is a Jew, by religion, but ethnically speaking he is Persian. As a Persian Jew myself, when people ask me what race I am, I say Persian, when they ask me my religion, I say Jewish, so I would appreciate it if it would be put on here some where that Sacha is ethnically Persian (not Iranian as that is a nationality), and under Sacha's religion, Jewish, I have put this on the page many times but it has been removed. His facial features lean further towards a Persian then a Israelite anyways, in my opinion. Thankyou.</p>
<p>-Actually, I just saw the movie and he refers to himself as a kazhak twice, once in subtitles so I'm pretty sure I couldn't have mistaken it</p>

<dd>I believe that in Azerbaijani, you can say "Yaxshisiniz?" meaning "Are you well?". The response would be "Yaxshiyam" ("I am well"). The Kazakh language belongs to the same language family as Azerbaijani (the Turkic language family), but Kazakh pronunciation differs from Azerbaijani's in systematic ways: the equivalent Kazakh expression would probably be "Zhaqsysyz ba?", with a response "Zhaqsymyn".

<p>_________</p>
<p>Yes, without any doubt Borat speaks in the film Hebrew, Polish etc. as above described. Yet we shouldn't forget that B<b>A</b>RAT [pronounced B<b>O</b>RAT, O like in the word "other", sorry I have no phonetical signs] means FRIEND in Hungarian. Also, his retarded brother, called BEL<b>A</b> [pronounced BEL<b>O</b> and not <s>BIHLO</s>] is a very common hungarian surename. There is a numerous Hungarian speaking population in the north-western part of Romania (Transylvania). The comedian Cohen tried to involve in his film as many as nations.</p>
<p>Sorry, borat/barat/brat... is Slavic orgin, and also a common Slavic name (in versions).</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>While by now everyone knows that in the movie Borat mostly speaks Hebrew (and some Polish), I think the readers might like to know that Borat's producer Azamat is actor Kenneth Davitian who is an American of Armenian descent and he speaks Armenian throughout the movie. Of course, no average American could ever tell these two very different languages apart.</p>

The correct version would have been "Путеводитель Бората по Америке" (Putevoditel' Borata po Amerike).

<p>The bit on the 'Russian code' is wrong. There is a fairly decent 1:1 mapping between most Cyrillic and Latin characters. Looks like the original poster simply remapped his keyboard and hit every key to come up with the 'code', but the Russian and English keyboard are not mapped the same way (ie. vowels aren't in the same spots, etc.).</p>
<p>I don't have a Russian keyboard close right now to post the correct mapping, but this would be something worth fixing over time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.18.142.123 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.18.142.123_1356.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.18.142.123">contribs</a>) 07:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Jak się masz" is clearly polish, as is "dziękuję". Also Borat states that his favourite drink is a blend of vodka with horse urine. Zubrówka is popular Polish drink that is rumored to contain vodka and urine of a bull.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Zubrowka is made from vodka flavoured with a herb called bison grass (sweet grass). There's a stem of the herb in the bottle. It has nothing to do with bull's urine, honestly! 86.6.7.45 12:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

The obvious question is why Sacha Baron Cohen would use a character from Kazakhstan? Perhaps because its easier to make fun of a country that is further removed, both on the map, and in the minds of the target audience.</p>
<p>Sacha Baron Cohen must have come up with the concept of an Eastern European somewhere, and possibly from encounters with Polish immigrants in his native Britan.</p>

<dd>If I may add, that Poland has always been considered part of Eastern Europe, and probably will be for a very long time to come. Remember that the term is more geo-political, and has roots in the cold war. Yes it does assert itself as Central Europe now, but then again, so does every other former Eastern European country.

<p>You can find this quote on Youtube - he says it multiple times at various press releases, so there is not one specific wording. However, he's quite clear that the point is that Kazakhstan is progressive because homosexuals NO LONGER have to wear blue hats (additionally, women can ride on inside of bus and the age of consent has been raised to 12 - although this age changes in different video clips).

<p>Can anyone imagine the outrage that would insue if a comedian from Kazakhstan had pretended to be a Jew and made such a derogetory and insulting portrayal of the Jewish people? Of course it'd be a cold day in hell before any such film would be released by a major Hollywood studio. Or what if the culture being mocked were Black (African American, African, Carribean, or whatever)? I imagine there would have been riots in the streets of America if any such film were to make it to the theatres. But I guess since the victim culture was one which most Americans know almost nothing about and which doesn't have any sort of influential minority community in the States then it's ok to make shit up about them and laugh at them as being a bunch of stupid backwards butt-fuckers...</p>
<p>Of course defenders of the film will likely argue that it was an over-the-top farce comedy that nobody will take seriously, but for many Americans, this will be their first impression of the nation of Kazakhstan, a nation they know nothing about, and a nation which (at least as far as I know) never did (the British Jew) Sacha Baron Cohen any harm. So I think Mr. Cohen owes the people of Kazakhstan an appology for his completly unwarranted bigotry against their nation. 128.206.155.237 17:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'd have to be pretty naive to even entertain the notion that Borat's Kazakhstan is in any way representative of the real-world version. Your analogy would be more akin to someone dressing up in an alien costume, saying they're Jewish, then trying to eat a bag of nails - nonsensical at best, with no basis in reality. That wouldn't make anyone upset in the slightest. The disappointment from Kazakhstan is from the great efforts Kazakhstan has made in self-development in recent years, trying to be a normal European/central-Asian country. The only people who are getting upset with this movie are people lacking either a sense of humour, or knowledge of the world past their own borders. Dave420 13:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One section of the article describes the film as "nonfiction." I'm not sure this is really accurate. It's true that many of the scenes were filmed with people (non-actors) who believed that a real documentary was being made, but of course the main character and his side-kick were both actors and their characters were completely made up and their pretense was completely false. So I think we should try and come up with a better label than "nonfiction" for the film. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelvetica_6c67.html" title="User:Helvetica">Helvetica</a> 20:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Um.. Yeah.. So I went ahead and changed the heading in front of the Cyrillic version of Borat's name from "Russian" to "Kazakh Cyrillic"... Mainly because he's not purpotedly Russian and has nothing to do with Russia, and since there is a Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet I thought it more appropriate for the entry to reflect such.</p>

<p>I have added Korki Buchek (Corky Bucek) to the Lingo section, taking care to be concise and make it clear that he is fictional. The spelling "Korki Buchek" has been deciphered from the captions in an MTV promotional video so I am assuming it to be the canonical spelling. --<a href="../../../l/p/h/User%7ELph_d5d1.html" title="User:Lph">Lph</a> 17:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would have to disagree, it simply states that a majority of the radical Islamic people are to the south. It does not imply a stereotype.

<p>I have heard and seen both Borat compare to the size of his khram. It would seem most fitting for his khram to be "thick like can of Pringles" due to the elongated nature of a Pringles can. I would see this as more fitting. Perhaps "Borat describes his khram 'thick like Pringles can' or less commonly, 'thick like Pepsi can'"? <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus999_df9e.html" title="User:Icarus999">Icarus999</a> 06:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says in the article that people are, "being unmasked for what they really are: antisemites" when Baron Cohen himself has said that the people are not necessarily actively antisemitic but at the very least are comfortable with antisemitism around them. Baron Cohen is not exposing outright racism in people but instead the idea that these people do not object to such racism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Specifically, the quote is "Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism." The entire modus operandi section reads like (poorly written) opinion, by the way. 76.167.145.143 04:54, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think its out of place to give this character his own page. He is only briefly mentioned at times by Borat, he does not appear in the film or televison show.

<p>- Russians certainly do not make up half the population of Kazakhstan.

The filmmaker takes the raw footage and edits it to portray the filmmaker's point of view and may distort the object of the people, in this case in documentary nonfiction — real actual people, who are being portrayed. Powers related a story of how he was used when another filmmaker asked him for an interview about a movie director whom Powers admired and filmed a whole hour. But the finished film only showed a few seconds of the interview when Powers made a nasty comment about that director. Powers attributes the controversy to the nonfiction format.</p>

<p>Statistics of Kazakhstan: Kazakh (Qazaq) 53.4%, Russian 30%, Ukrainian 3.7%, Uzbek 2.5%, German 2.4%, Tatar 1.7%, Uygur 1.4%, other 4.9% (1999 census). - CIA World Factbook: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/kz.html#People" class="external free" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/kz.html#People" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/kz.html#People</a>. And Religion: Muslim 47%, Russian Orthodox 44%, Protestant 2%, other 7%. So Muslims are not the majority. BTW, Kazakhstan is one of the most peaceful nations I've seen, due to both Christians and Muslims co-operating! Let's not have the two groups bash each other, the duo that fought side by side to defeat Hitler, and then return to their homeland. Just cause Bin Laden's a wacko, doesn't mean all Muslims are, just as Hitler didn't represent all Germans. My POV: I'm a Christian, who believes that we should stop fucking each other on Earth and begin exploring space instead. Here's how I'd alter the quote: "In fact, Kazakhstan is one of the most tolerant Central Asian nations because almost half its population is Russian, who are historically Orthodox, and its native Kazakhs are usually mixing Islam with with other religions and pagan rituals." At least it's factual and professional, and doesn't bash neighboring countries.</p>

<p>First of all, I see a number of spelling mistakes in this article. I'll correct the ones that I do find, but it seems as if this article was written by someone who doesn't use spell check. Also, Is it really necessary to say that 'we' were overwhelmed by irony when Cohen, who is a Jew, makes fun of Jews? It just sounds like a flag or a phrase with the intent to flag anti-Semite censors that this comedian or this page is not, in fact, anti-Semite. It sould be held that any material here on Wikipedia, unless specifically on these subjects at hand, are neutral and do not need to include such cute nuances as the last sentence in this opening paragraph, as it should be a given that this page or this media released to a public audience already has had *sufficient* warning that there is no anti-Semitism related with this movie or character.</p>
<p>I moved the aforementioned part from the opening paragraph into "Political Beliefs", that it may find relevance there.</p>

<p>Borat's myspace says his birthday is March 27, which is correct, where did the wiki date come from?</p>

<p>I noticed that this page contains box office data which seems odd because this is a biography of a person, not an article about a film. Surely this data should be on the movie page? Any comments?</p>

<p>The Box Office Gross amounts do not tell you how much in which country. It also assumes the person lives in the USA. Someone needs to find an alternitive and better source. -144.132.50.66 07:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my opinion the box office figures should not be included - they relate to a film, not a fictional character. There is already information in the article about Borat's film gross, there is no need for this section? Any comments? RaseaC 12:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
