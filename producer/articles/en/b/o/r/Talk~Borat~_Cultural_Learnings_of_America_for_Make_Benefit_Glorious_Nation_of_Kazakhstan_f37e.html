<p>This article has references from other movies as almost purposeful, yet they are clearly EXTREMELY coincidental. In any case, these do not in any way belong in this article as they add nothing to the movie.</p>
<p>Example: "The King and I. Borat's translated line upon learning that Anderson has written a book, "A woman has written a book?" echoes that (as does his reaction) of the King in The King and I, upon learning of Harriett Beecher Stowe's writing of Uncle Tom's Cabin." - this is nothing more but a coincidence stemming from both characters in both movies being misogynists/ignorant of women's intelligence, completely separately from one another.</p>
<p>I don't think that section has any relevance to the movie either. Just coincidences - I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen had any intention to make allusions to popular culture like that in the movie.</p>

<dd>There is a mix of both but mainly real people, Borat's producer is an actor, and Pam Anderson is an actor but mainly its just real people he interviews.

<p>It is absolutely not a sequel (though, to correct you, Borat did in fact appear in Ali G Indahouse). They are entirely different characters; a sequel would imply that it was the continuation of the story of the same characters and their struggle (new or old). Just because they exist in the same world doesn't mean they are sequels. (--Great Scrivener 21:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>In this section it list Southeast Texas as a region where the film was not shown. I live in Houston and saw the movie, so I don't think this is entirely accurate.

<p>The film (as noted in the Wikipedia article) reached 232 in the IMDB top 250 on Sunday 8 October 2006. Strangely, the next day it dropped out of the top 250, and has not since reappeared in the list, while maintaining the same 'raw' arithmetic mean score, 9.4 out of 10.</p>
<p>Strangest of all, according to IMDB, the votes of 150 women up to Monday 9 October produced an average of 9.1, but 24 more female voters on Tuesday brought this average down (according to IMDB) to 6.5.</p>
<p>150 x 9.1 = 1365 total female points on Monday</p>
<p>174 x 6.5 = 1131 total female points on Tuesday</p>
<p>So 24 extra voters somehow managed to REDUCE the points accumulated by 150 female voters up to Monday.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that IMDB has actually interfered with the 'democratic' mechanics of user's votes. President Bush had expressed his displeasure at the film, and Kazakhstan is an oil-rich frontline state in his 'War on/of Terror'.</p>
<p>Isn't democracy wonderful in Kazakhstan, IMDB and the US and A?</p>

<p>I'm adding this article to Category:Da Ali G Show because Borat was a product of that show. I realize that Ali G himself does not appear in this movie, but it's still relevant to the show. (p.s. I've been to Kazakhstan, there's nothing there, thought'cha might like to know.) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 05:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Did Cohen film all the Borat scenes in America at once? Or did he make several trips over years developing the character and the concept as he went? Are any scenes from the Ali G show included in the movie? It would be nice to have more information about how the character developed from a minor subsection on the Ali G show to it's own film. Maybe such a description should be/is? under Borat, but it would be nice to mention/reference it from here. ChristineD 23:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the opening credits, some one is referred to as operating "the camera machine"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anybody else notice that Azamat's last name (Bagatov) is the same as the film company in the beginning (when it says Kazakhstan Ministry of Information in association with Bagatov Films) does anyone know if this film company actually exist and if so is this guy the actual owner of the film company?</dd>

<p>The subtitles not always accurate. For example when Azatmat tells Borat that he scheduled a meeting with feminists, he refers to the feminists as "whores" in Armenian. The English subtitles didn't have that as far as I can remember. I wasn't reading them very carefully though, since I could understand Armenian.</p>

<dd>I don't think they were supposed to be accurate. They were talking two totally different languages in the first place. Do you think they would actually do correct subtitles lol?

<p>I didn't see this anywhere in the Borat page or the movie page - evidence of particular scenes being staged or not. Wouldn't this be interesting information?</p>

</ul>
<p>Pamela reports on her official website: "Of course Sasha and I planned this years ago." Plus, there is a big Borat picture on her homepage.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6136944.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6136944.stm" rel="nofollow">Fraternity RV scene</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the RV part itself was contrived, but the fraternity brothers were not actors.</p>
<p><br />
Once there are a bunch more facts, we should move this section to the full movie page.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that we focus more on the facts than random opinions about the likelihood of a scene being staged or not. Pamela's admission on her site is a clear indicator that something fishy was going on at least, however.</p>
<p>The Borat board has some sourced facts on it, but I'm not going to list them all here.</p>

Well OF COURSE the Pamela Anderson scene was staged. Do you think he'd have absolutely gone up to her in public and tried to carry her off without vetting it in advance? (Unsigned).</p>
<p>My response to this is that some scenes (including Pamela's) might be obvious to some people, but there are a lot of unbelievable things in this movie, so I'd prefer to put sources down before making judgments about a particular scene. SkepticVK 22:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although appearing in some of the early promotional art for the film, it really seems evident that the exclamation mark following the abbreviated title was more a bloc-style flourish in some promotional art than an intended punctuation in the title.

<p>Borat speaks (other than English) with Azamat in Hebrew - but doesn't he also speak some other language to him? May be it is Armenian, because that is what Azamat (supposedly, don't know Armenian from Albanian...) speaks to Borat? Anyone know?--<a href="../../../s/o/y/User%7ESoylentyellow_0465.html" title="User:Soylentyellow">Soylentyellow</a> 23:37, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aside from "jagshemash" and "chenquieh," which are Slavic, not Hebrew, he does appear to echo a few of the Armenian words that Azamat says, presumably for believability's sake. But I'm sure Baron Cohen he doesn't understand more than a handful of Armenian words. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:36, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In the so-called Kazakh village, Borat's wife, Oxana curses him in Romanian "futu-ti pizda ma-tii..." (meaning "f*** your mother"). Aslo while he is leaving the village to go to the U.S and A., a villager wishes him the best in Romanian. The pulled by horse blue car is a Dacia 1300, a Romanian car manufactured in the 80s. I am not a language expert but some words such as "děkuji" mean "thank you" in Czech, Slovak and maybe Polish.</p>

<p>I feel as if the plot section is virtually a script to the movie! (as if there were a script and none of it were improvised) Wikipedia's policy on movie pages is that any plot summary not be a virtual subsitute for watching the movie itself. And some of the other sections are becoming so long I would feel they warrant their own articles (such as how all the different countries are reacting to it) I didn't make any edits without making mention of this in the discussion page, of course, but I did add the "toolong" tag (it more than exceeds 32 KB).

<p>About the Cyrillic used in the film, the article says: "words written in it (especially the geographical names) are either mis-spelled, or make no sense at all. The promotional posters also spell "BORДT" with a Cyrillic letter for D substituted for the A." I have two remarks. The type of writing of "BORДT" is called <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faux_Cyrillic_f280.html" title="Faux Cyrillic">faux Cyrillic</a>.

<dd>i'm from israel. the word is "kus" is slang for vagina (pretty much like "pussy" in english). the begining of the name "kusek" is "kus", but it didn't seem to me in the movie that there is any connection. he uses hebrew in the movie but doesn't change the words like that. just like if it were named "pussiek" would anyone relate it to "pussy"!? i think it should be sourced, explained or removed. --<a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaj_Sherman_26f4.html" title="User:Itaj Sherman">itaj</a> 14:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've promoted this to GA. Everything appears sufficiently sourced; the language is comprehensive; it appears to cover the topic (at least it contains everything I'd like to know); and it contains image where relevant. There are -- in my opinion -- still some clear flaws in the article, but for GA i think it meats the criterias sufficiently.</p>
<p>I react to the lead section, which appears to be focused on in U.S release; not up to the recommendations of <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, that says that the lead should summirize the article. However, I deem it OK for GA&#160;:-) The next step would be a peer review. Good luck.</p>

<p>One editor keeps putting a reference to the War on Terrorism where the article mentions Borat applauding, at a jingoistic rodeo, Bush's "war of terror". Undoubtedly Borat thinks he is using the term "War on Terror", but Cohen, in his sardonic way, obviously is not. In addition, I disagree with the editor who says supplying the link would explain the joke for people who might not get it. I doubt that. They either get the joke, or their grasp of English, like Borat's, is so confused they will not even understand that there was a joke intended.

<dd>OK,but how does the edit help people get the joke? And I think you are mistaken when you say "war of terror" is similarly mangled.

<p>The decision of the Israeli movie distributor to not use a poster of Borat in his swimsuit IS NOT censorship. Advertising is ALWAYS customized to sensitivities of different markets.

<p>Per the note at the top -- <i>Add information from the DVD (what scenes were cut, anything important on any commentary tracks or documentaries, and what happened to the porno scene)</i> -- I added info about the deleted scenes appearing on the DVD. There are no commentary tracks, at least on the rental version, nor any mention of the porno scene. There are no documentaries per se, but quite a few segments from real appearances by Cohen as Borat -- these are called "Propagandas" on the DVD -- on programs like <i>The Tonight Show</i> (where he gets into a bed made by Martha Stewart and takes of his pants and underwear). 4.232.195.249 20:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a play on Borat's Kazakh heritage, the packaging mimics a foreign bootleg DVD. The slipcover is in English but the case itself has all-Cyrillic text (a majority of which is in legitimate Russian, not faux Cyrillic) and is made to look poorly photocopied.</p>

<p>We've got the DVD, and the inside case is not in "all-Cyrillic." It's exactly the same as the slipcover. As for "looking photocopied," aside from the fake creases on the front of both there's nothing that would suggest that intent.

<p>"Demorez" actually, on the lower portion of the DVD (there are three parallel lines there, as if to allow for a place to write). If you look casually at it, all you will see is "BORAT" (R reversed). The DEMOREZ is almost the same color as the disk. Under "DEMOREZ", you see in small print "IS LIFE? NO, DEMOREZ".

<p>I have the US version of the DVD with the case insert in half-Russian and the DVD-R-appearance of the disc, and I live in the UK.

<p>There is nothing but a brief mention of how this movie is anti-Arabic. It may elicit a chuckle here and there, but I'm sure people found <i>Opie and Andy</i> funny too. This movie is simply racist propaganda showing Arabs to be ignorant savages. This shit is as lame and racist as Carlos Mencia. 151.200.228.57 17:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really don't see how. Borat is not an Arab. He is not even Muslim, when the "rodeo clown" asks him about his religion, he says he follows the hawk. He later becomes Christian. If you have reliable sources backing up your assertions, though, I'd be glad to see if it is possible to integrate the info into the article.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 17:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the suffix stan is Arabic for "place." That's why countries like Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and yes, even Kazakhstan are populated mainly by Arabic people (though, not necessarily Muslims). From the CIA World factbook on Kazakhstan: Religions: Muslim 47% Ethnic Groups: Kazakh (Qazaq) 53.4%<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/kz.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/kz.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> From the Wikipedia entry on Kazakh/Qazaq people: "There are also three classifications based on ancestry outside of the jüz system: töre (direct descendants of Genghis Khan), qoja (descendants of Arabian missionaries and warriors), and töleñgit (descendants of Oirat captives)." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazaq" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazaq" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

<p>So, the majority of the population of Kazakhstan are ethnically Arabic and religiously Muslim people. My point is that this movie is simply an attempt to drum up support for more military adventurism blowing up folks. Look at the end of the movie. Borat comes back from America with Ipods and everyone is happy. It's not making the case for war with Borat or Kazakhstan in particular, but Arabs and Muslims in general. Hooray for the White Man's Burden and Manifest Destiny. Now let's go blow some folks up. Iran, I'm looking at you. 151.200.228.57 14:36, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this joke only works if you're already familiar with illicit DVDs. All of the law-abiding DVD buyers - the ones the film studios love - will be looking at the disc and thinking "WTF"?</p>
<p>I have to hand it to them for authenticity, though, it completely matches the look of my real pirate DVDs. If it wasn't for the "Demorez" logo instead of "Memorex", I'd never know the difference. 217.155.20.163 19:14, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
