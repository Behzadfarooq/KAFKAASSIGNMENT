<p>You recently made an edit to the article <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Wukong_f7ad.html" title="Sun Wukong">Sun Wukong</a>, stating that "Commas and periods always go inside quotation marks. ALWAYS." This is true only as taught in the United States. The United Kingdom and other countries more closely tied to the former empire apply logic to whether or not the comma or period should go within the quotes. Here's a couple references a quick search pulled up: <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/quotation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/quotation.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.grammartips.homestead.com/inside.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammartips.homestead.com/inside.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Just thought you should know (and give you a heads up on any potential cultural backlash). --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverend_Loki_a35b.html" title="User:Reverend Loki">Reverend Loki</a> 00:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Daizex.com <a href="http://www.daizex.com/general/ask/archive/2004_02_08.shtml#4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.daizex.com/general/ask/archive/2004_02_08.shtml#4" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <i>whether or not she intentionally derived that from the name of the original Hawaiian king, we don't know; a rough translation of the Japanese would be "Turtle Destruction Wave," though, so it really could go either way.</i> According to <b>Dragon Ball Z: The Anime Adventure Game</b>, a licensed Dragon Ball Z RPG by R. Talsorian games, "--according to Akira Toriyama himself, the Kamehameha attack was named by his wife, who really <i>was</i> thinking of the Hawaiian king!" This in the "In Translation" info box on page 45 of the first book.</p>
<p>However, that particular series of RPG books makes a number of incredible errors in logic, the use of facts stated in the manga of Dragon Ball and anime of Dragon Ball Z, and internal consistency. This is attributed to the books being written, editted, and so-forth, primarily by one man. While the books are riddles with inconsistencies and errors, there is still quite a bit they do get right, and which can be checked with other sources online, or in print, to verify that they are indeed correct, and this is one of those that appears to have logical and factual backing, as most places where I have seen explanations of the origins of the Kamehameha's name included that it definitely was named after the Hawaiian king. This does not necessarily make it true, as just because a number of people believe, say, or do something speaks nothing for whether it is correct or not, however if multiple licensed or trusted sources make a claim, I am more likely to believe it than if it was just some fan theory.</p>
<p>I am unaware of any websites that have interviews with Akira Toriyama on them, and if I found them, they would most likely be in Japanese, which, unfortunately, I never picked up from my mom, and my computer doesn't support translation programs for it, due to a lot of stupid things I won't bore you with. Thus, I am unable to verify R. Talsorian Games' claims that Toriyama stated specifically that his wife was thinking of the Hawaiian king. However, misquoting someone, or saying they said something they didn't could have landed them in a lot of hot water, and since no legal action was taken against them, they were most likely correct about this. After all, they readily admit that Toriyama did NOT ever state specifically in the manga or anime by what amount one's powerlevel is modified when using Super Saiyajin 1, other than later on saying that it, "can't be measured mathematically", which would make sense, seeing as power levels seemed to fluctuate in SSJ1 based on emotional state. The angrier or more determined an individual is, the stronger they get. This may not make sense from a logical perspective, but one must remember that Akira Toriyama is a storyteller, and thus goes with what makes a good story, rather than what necessarily makes sense to people who overanalyze his works.</p>
<p>I diverged from the main topic, but the point remains that the two sources I provided either outright state that it was named after Kamehameha I, or admit it is a possibility. I have not seen anyone deny it, or propose a different theory. Something else that should be taken into consideration is Akira Toriyama's love of puns. Wouldn't it make sense for him to use a name that had two meanings in order to introduce yet another pun into his writing? If you can provide evidence that goes counter to that which I have provided, or point out any errors in logic, please do so.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Since you've got an interest in the Devil May Cry articles, I figured you'd like to drop by and give me your comments about my rewrite. I'm planning on doing similar sourcing for the Gameplay section and the Reaction section. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 08:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments regarding the Plot Summary rewrite. I'll be taking your advice into consideration and will be shortening the article a bit but I would argue that the length is roughly where it needs to be by Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../s/n/a/Metal_Gear_Solid_3%7E_Snake_Eater_4db9.html" title="Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> is a Featured Article game roughly similar to Devil May Cry 2 in terms of size and scope and the plot summary is almost as large as the "raw" form I've written here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, as I mentioned on the Devil May Cry 2 talk page, this rewrite was just a rough which can serve as a guideline while I do condense things. Anyway, thanks again for the feedback! It's really appreciated. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 16:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to be fair to you in terms of citing, I've lucked out for the plot section by having a copy of the script. It was pretty much just a case of copying, pasting, and a bit of work with the formatting to get everything cited in the article. I'm sure that by the time I finish the Devil May Cry 2 summary it'll probably be down to around 400-500 words. I'll drop a line to ask you to look things over when I do some more work on the thing, if you don't mind. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 04:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>By the way, I've managed to drop about 200 words off of the Plot Summary. I think the official count was 619 words, though again it could probably use some better compacting here and there. If you wouldn't mind taking another look, I'd appreciate it. A second set of eyes on any wall of text always helps. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 03:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure, I'd have no problems checking over the Lucia entry and adding something for Arius. As far as Argosax is concerned, I don't really think it's necessary for him to have an entry. Most of the details concerning him are vaguely implied at best and he's pretty much just a plot device. Any entry I could cook up would probably be a few sentences long. Instead, I'll roll information on Argosax into the Arius portion.</p>
<p>Though funnily enough, I don't actually own <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_May_Cry_2_1604.html" title="Devil May Cry 2">Devil May Cry 2</a> myself... I'm just borrowing a copy from a friend. The entire reason I started working the article is pure spite for some of the lazier Wikipedians who spend most of their time complaining. I think one user complained that the DMC2 article was the worst of the lot, so now I'm going to try to make it the best.</p>
<p>The editing of the Characters in Devil May Cry article will have to wait until later, however. Sorry. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 20:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had a chance to read over the rewritten section about Lucia. It looks pretty good as it is, though it could probably use some sourcing. I'll take care of that when I get home if you haven't already, since most of the sourcing can be taken from the stuff I've done for the Devil May Cry 2 article. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 20:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, my name is Charles and I would like to ask you about Goku's height. I saw your opinion well at the "Talk:Son Goku (Dragon Ball)" site. I also want to believe Goku's height is about 170cm(5'7") as the Daizenshuu says. However, I found an interesting material saying his height is 175cm. I wouldn't think highly of this if this claim is on a private site, but this fact that Goku's height is 175cm is on a Japanese wikipedia page. Because Japan is where Dragonball series were born, I carefully propose that Goku's height could actually be 175cm as the Japanese wikipeia page says. If his height is really 5'7" as the Daizenshuu states, I would like you to prove that 5'7" is height of not 'growing' Goku, but 'fully-grown' Goku, and retort the content on the Japanese wikipedia page that Goku's height is 175cm. Here's the site that insists Goku's height is 175cm. <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E6%82%9F%E7%A9%BA_%28%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%29#.E6.80.A7.E6.A0.BC.E3.81.AA.E3.81.A9" class="external autonumber" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E6%82%9F%E7%A9%BA_%28%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%29#.E6.80.A7.E6.A0.BC.E3.81.AA.E3.81.A9" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHilight_c7b3.html" title="User:Hilight">Hilight</a> 06:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I was actually looking up Hanma wich is the correct term for demon-human hybrid, but somebody had the brilliant idea of merging it on the Hanyō page, the only description of Hanma is there even further the term Half-Demon redirects there, what should we do? -<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">Dark Dragon Flame</a> 04:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok then, yeah the only thing close to a "heaven" (funny considering that is their "hell") is where you find Mundus as an statue in the first game; somebody should create a separate page for half demon though. -<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">Dark Dragon Flame</a> 04:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah they are simmilar I didn't gave it much thought and it didn't hit me (it wasn't as obvious as other references to The Divine Comedy and it has been three years since last time I read it) about the demon world's resemblance to cristianity's teorical "heaven" I think there might be a message there, at least we know there is more than one god in the <i>Sparda universe</i> so I somewhat doubt they will use the view of monotestic afterlife because in my opinion something like that might make followers of religions other than Cristianity or Islam and so on lose interest in the series wich translates to we may never know.</dd>

<p>Sorry to bother. It seems that Dante's article is going through a lot of changes lately, more than what I can keep a record of since I haven't been able to expend much time around the internet lately, but I hope everything turns out ok in the end.</p>
<p>At any rate, I was wondering if you really believe that the images should be reduced. I won't complain if you feel like that, it's just that, well, I don't think anyone likes his or her work being left apart or discarded, and I've actually got a liking to illustrating articles.</p>
<p>So... well, tell me what you think, and cheers, I know you're doing your best with Dante's and other DMC's articles ^_^ (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexlayer_975c.html" title="User:Alexlayer">Alexlayer</a> 13:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p><br />
Yeah, I alredy got it that more is not always better, it's just that I felt that images was a point down in Dante's article during the latest articles. I think I'll try to look careful on it and decide with images should go and which not (By example, I don't think that two images of Dante in DMC1 is better than two of him in diferents games). I'll also try to base my work in Featured and Good Articles. Thanks for the opinion (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexlayer_975c.html" title="User:Alexlayer">Alexlayer</a> 16:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

Other changes I just made however don't affect their requests. I only took out information on why Trish was crying (plot relevant how?) and a mention of Eva's name (again, not relevant). Also, I fixed spelling errors and typos, changed <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_voice.html" title="Grammatical voice">passive voice writing to active voice</a>, and explained each edit in detail.
