<dd>I would have thought that that is because the discovery and publicising of a new species attracts a lot of attention, which both prompts people to edit Wikipedia and provides an easy supply of references for articles.

<p>Did Cuvier identify it as <i>Neofelis diardi</i> or as <i>Neofelis nebulosa diardi</i>? What is the background of this, considering that the recent research confirming two species is only from 2006?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 17:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah... a bit of "how to read" is in order. The parenthesis around the authority indicate that the author didn't describe it with this name, but that the species was later moved to the current name. However, you can not tell what Cuvier named it. The authority doesn't attach to the current name, but to the initial description of the species. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 17:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A good example of the history of a species can be gleaned from its synonyms. See <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion-tailed_Macaque_83f1.html" title="Lion-tailed Macaque">Lion-tailed Macaque</a> for such a listing in the taxobox. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 17:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The parentheses mean that when Cuvier named it he placed it in a different genus (presumably either <i>Felis</i> or maybe <i>Panthera</i>) and it was subsequently moved to a separate genus (<i>Neofelis</i>). According to the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinomen.html" title="Trinomen">trinomen</a> article, subspecies weren't used much until after 1900, so Cuvier probably recognized <i>N. diardi</i> as a full species. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 18:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>diardii</i> is clearly a synonym for <i>diardi</i>, but not of <i>nebulosa</i>. <i>Felis macrocelis</i> Horsfield, 1825 is a synonym of <i>nebulosa</i> (but again, not of <i>diardi</i>) according to MSW. Without a type locality I wouldn't know how to deal with <i>marmota</i>. All of these synonyms will apply to only one or the oher and should not apply to both articles. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 02:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no problems with this.

<dd>On Friday, <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a> had an image announcing this discovery on the 2nd page of the news section. But I don't know if this image is simply a normal leopard or a Bornean clouded leopard. Either way, that image is from Reuters Photo as stated on the newspaper. When I go to Reuter's website and conduct a search on this image, it only presents me a text article but no image. To make long story short, I found the image on another website and you can see it here <a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/03_01/leopardR1403_600x463.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/03_01/leopardR1403_600x463.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/03_01/leopardR1403_600x463.jpg</a>.

It also appears that most "clouded leopards" at international zoos (or at least American zoos) are Neofelis nebulosa, as they are part of a <a href="http://www.cloudedleopard.org/thailand.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cloudedleopard.org/thailand.htm" rel="nofollow">breeding project with Thailand</a>.

<dd>There are no cloudies in Java... The illustrations for diardi(i) in Jardine are misidentifications (from Marbled Cat skins) caused by a "false lead" from Cuvier's statement re. Java and the Edinburgh skins being ID'd on that geographic basis. However, Jardine states clearly that there appeared to be a problem with the difference in size between the skins of the cats used as a basis for those engravings (diardii) and the text description given for the species. I've replaced the illustration for the time being with the correct species (Rimau-Dahan/macrocelis) from Jardine, plate 9, taken from Horsfield's original illo. in 1825.--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 06:37, 19 March 2007 (GMT)

<dd>Yeah, I had sort of figured that "Java" was a general colloquialism for the East Indies islands. Thanks for clearing this up, and for pointing out the historical error. By the way, is it clear that the new plate you've put up is from an insular specimen?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 06:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"In theory", "Java" should mean Java... There are still a few questions that I cannot answer re. the original type specimen for diardi, nor do I have the correct edition of Cuvier (or Griffith's translation from that), alas. Must admit I was rather slow on the uptake given that this is "old news" in the scientific press (end-2006). The plate and original text description for the Rimau-Dahan in Jardine (Temminck's macrocelis, at that point in 1834) are from Horsfield, relating to a Sumatran specimen held by Stamford Raffles. It was unclear then whether nebulosa (unillustrated in Jardine) was a separate species or not (footnoted; "Felis nebulosa of Griffith, if proved to be distinct, will be closely allied; but we cannot yet state what may be its distinctions."). It doesn't get any less confusing 100+ years further down the line... Trust that's of some use for now, anyhow.--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 07:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He appears to have described it as <i>Felis diardi</i>. The decision to call the two distinct species was probably based on the differences in coat coloration. It may have been due to poor communication and not an intent to call them distinct, though it looks like Griffith and Cuvier did read one another's work. The status of subspecies did not enjoy any real usage at this point in time so one should not read too much into Cuvier's decision to call it a species instead of a subspecies. <i>Felis diardi</i> will often be mispelled as <i>Felis diardii</i>.</li>

<dd>Interesting blog, Pharos. Thank you! Glad to read I'm not the only dissenting voice on the species naming. Indonesian Clouded Leopard is just as good as Sumatran (from the original type specimens), IMO, whereas Bornean is just plain PR spooled out thousands of times via the news channels and thus somehow deemed 'notable'. Anyhow; the reference for Raffles in that article should, I believe, be Raffles S. 1821. Descriptive catalogue of a zoological collection made in Sumatra. Trans. Linn. Soc. Lond. 13:239-274 (page 251 to be precise). That citation for 1822 is, I suspect, a glitch that crept in and was repeated at later dates, but I can't guarantee that 100%. That vol. 13 equates to 1821 can be cross-checked against <a href="http://www.saxifraga.org/publications/magazine/article1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.saxifraga.org/publications/magazine/article1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saxifraga.org/publications/magazine/article1.htm</a> and others online. Raffles was indeed the first person to describe the clouded leopard in Sumatra, but he wasn't a "scientist". The author of the blog is obviously aware of other possible issues in that they relate to Cuvier "coin[ing] Felis diardii in honour of his student Pierre-Medrad Diard", whereas I've been told by one of the co-authors of the current scientific papers that the type specimen for diardii is believed still to exist (hopefully with a proper description of the distinctions!), not just a mere "coining". IMO, that's potentially "shaky ground" since Cuvier referred to Java which is out of range and named the species deliberately after Diard, whose specimens had been confiscated by Raffles for whom he and Duvaucel were working rather than permit those to be returned to Cuvier in Paris. Would be possible to conjecture that Cuvier just stated Java to avoid any further conflict with Raffles, but research is required to determine the validity of that claim (although personally I'd've thought that both a correct description of species distinctions and a valid type location are required to name a species!). All of this contrasts with the cast-iron, detailed description of macrocelis by Horsfield in 1825 (Zoological Journal, vol. 1, p. 542) which was from Raffles *actual* specimens collected in Sumatra, with the clear proviso that even a decade later (Jardine, 1834) there was still no decision as to whether Griffith's nebulosa was distinct or not (see quote above) far less the elusive "Javan" diardi(i).--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 21:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>aside: Does anyone know who "officially" titled this species the *Bornean* Clouded Leopard, or was that designation purely for publicity purposes? i.e. there is already a Sumatran tiger, therefore the Clouded Leopard was designated Bornean to avoid competition for the most charismatic megafauna within the former geographic designation? (cynic me?) The type specimen for macrocelis is definitely from Sumatra (Bengkulu to be precise) and that for diardi *must* be Sumatra, also, even though it was 'alleged' to be Java (repeated as 'fact' at least until 1939 in Pocock's definitive 'Fauna of British India'), given the travels of the relevant naturalists. For the time being, I'll put "or Sumatran Clouded Leopard" on the first line pending any *official* source, but that should be an adequate alternative name regardless and was, indeed, in circulation prior to March 2007.

<dd>The Kitchener <i>et al.</i> paper refers solely to <i>Neofelis diardi</i> without using any common name. The Buckley-Beason <i>et al.</i> paper largely also just refers to <i>Neofelis diardi</i>. It does at one point refer to "Bornean clouded leopards" but their study only used Bornean specimens and their use of those words seems to be in the sense of "clouded leopards from Borneo" rather than an attempt to christen <i>Neofelis diardi</i> with a common name. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBondegezou_315a.html" title="User:Bondegezou">Bondegezou</a> 15:08, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The WWF is in no way in charge of naming a species, four months after the relevant scientific papers; this being the impression currently given! If Wikipedia articles should be verifiable, where is the "official" source for <b>Bornean Clouded Leopard</b>? Lacking such an official source (if indeed one is required for a species' common name), the addition of a geographic prefix does not automatically make for an "official" name and any of the former subspecies pseduonyms are thus at *least* equally valid. <b>Sumatran Clouded Leopard</b> has been used in that context for the former subspecies in various sources both online and offline. For example, the 21st Century Tiger (i.e. co-funded by the Zoological Society of London) report dated 2005 at <a href="http://www.21stcenturytiger.org/projects/reports/Project1_FFI_Final_Report_2005.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.21stcenturytiger.org/projects/reports/Project1_FFI_Final_Report_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.21stcenturytiger.org/projects/reports/Project1_FFI_Final_Report_2005.pdf</a> clearly uses <b>Sumatran Clouded Leopard</b> as opposed to the adjacent textual reference to Malay sunbear which does not add a "Sumatran" prefix: this is no surprise as the type specimens for diardi/macrocelis originated from Sumatra, not Borneo.... For lack of any evidence that <b>Bornean Clouded Leopard</b> was in use prior to March 2007, the usage of <b>Sumatran Clouded Leopard</b> for the former subspecies name is at least as valid as a pseudonym in the current context. (This is not "indulging in original research", merely a statement of fact, I believe). Kitchener's paper, at least, in "Current Biology" sticks to scientific nomenclature with no proposal for the species common name. May I throw down the gauntlet in return to anyone who wishes to state that <b>Bornean Clouded Leopard</b> is the only correct common name form to evidence that usage *both* prior to March 2007 (for the former subspecies) and after March 2007 (for the currently designated species)?--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 17:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Common names are, just that, common names. There is no official source because there is no body charged with determining such matters. Nobody is in charge of them; all we have is usage. Everything I've seen about <i>N. diardi</i> as a separate species refers to it under the common name of the Bornean Clouded Leopard. A Google search for "Bornean clouded leopard" gives plenty of hits; one for "Sumatran Clouded Leopard" hardly gives any at all. Prior common names for when it was known scientifically as <i>N. nebulosa diardi</i> do, I agree with you, seem valid. However, as far as I can make out, it was generally known just as the Clouded Leopard, with various geographical descriptors used. Does the 21st Century Tiger report use the term "Sumatran Clouded Leopard" to refer to the full range of the species/subspecies, or just to the Sumatran population? If the former, then I agree that seems a valid citation for that common name. If the latter, it isn't. I am not stating that Bornean Clouded Leopard is the only correct common name, but I would like to see citations for alternatives. I don't see the need for evidence of the common name being used for the former subspecies. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBondegezou_315a.html" title="User:Bondegezou">Bondegezou</a> 18:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we even certain that anyone is trying to give this a common name? Buckley-Beason et al. (2006) appear to be using Bornean clouded leopard in the sense of "clouded leopard from Borneo" and don't seem to be attempting to give it a name. They didn't look at animals from Sumatra. I'm also not convinced WWF is trying to name it either. Again, their interest seems to focus on their work going on in Borneo and seem to be referring to the Bornean population of clouded leopards. The genetic data seem to form the backbone of this discussion, and the Sumatran population gets pooled into it due to the Kitchener et al. (2006) paper (who don't attempt to use common names). Somebody somewhere had to have listed the conservation status of this subspecies prior to the current news frenzy and they presumably used a common name. I'm with Bondegezou in saying that there's no such thing as a formal common name for mammals. Bornean, Indonesian, or Sumatran all seem valid common names (all used in one source or another) to me. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 00:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For all intents and purposes though, I do think "Bornean Clouded Leopard" should be considered the common name, to the extent that one exists. It is this name that has been used in hundreds of news sources all over the world. Yes, it does seem to have originated from a press release, but I guess that's just the way these things work — it does not seem likely, given all the publicity, that popular writers will adopt another name in the near future.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 02:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aranae is correct that the DNA analysis hinges totally on three specimens from Borneo, with none from Sumatra, per <a href="http://download.current-biology.com/supplementarydata/curbio/16/23/2371/DC1/mmc1.pdf" class="external free" title="http://download.current-biology.com/supplementarydata/curbio/16/23/2371/DC1/mmc1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://download.current-biology.com/supplementarydata/curbio/16/23/2371/DC1/mmc1.pdf</a> . It's debatable whether pelage alone is adequate to describe the range of a species nowadays, as opposed to further phylogenetic analysis including specimens from the Sumatran population. Anyhow, that aside, from a historic perspective the main hang-up over providing something approaching a *definitive* common name for diardi in an historic context appears to have been the uncertain status of those animals in the Malayan peninsula owing to data deficiencies. (Contrary to the above, the scientific community does provide a strong lead on reinforcing or directing common name(s) "of choice"; hence the likes of "Amur tiger" on the first line under the entry for "Siberian tiger"). Even the IUCN's Wild Cats Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan (ed. Nowell and Jackson, 1996) includes the Malayan peninsula for diardi although that still appears to have been "provisional" all the way from Pocock in 1939... Coming back to the point at hand, though, as agreed with Aranae, there is nothing to suggest that "Bornean Clouded Leopard" is any more "valid" than "Sumatran Clouded Leopard" or "Indonesian Clouded Leopard" and if the usage of "Bornean Clouded Leopard" derives solely a single NGO press release based on genetic analysis of Bornean felines without proper consideration for the species as a whole, repeating that common name alone without any other options, clarification, or even a possible "name controversy" section (with/without historical context) seems to me to be more media-driven than an encyclopedia should be expected to be. (aside: Nothing on the IUCN site yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to see "Indonesian Clouded Leopard" or "Diard's Cat" (works AOK for the manul!) in due course).--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 03:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've changed the opening paragraph, hopefully to cover the points being made. I still feel it smacks of original research for us to be bandying around alternate names if we're not seeing them being used widely, but I've phrased the introduction to be clearer that the "Bornean Clouded Leopard" designation comes from a particular source. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBondegezou_315a.html" title="User:Bondegezou">Bondegezou</a> 11:21, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I do like that revised phrasing ("Neofelis diardi is... and publicised under the name Bornean Clouded Leopard by...") much better since that leaves things much more open for any future developments and clarifies precisely the nature of the nomenclature. Would personally give the thumbs up to anyone who might suggest that format as a standard for any "new" species/subspecies entries of this nature.--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarami2000_9596.html" title="User:Harami2000">Harami2000</a> 14:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The Economist</i> doesn't actually mention any scientist who challenges the status of the the species. It cunningly drops the name of the evolutionary biologist who has coined the term "species inflation", but thorough reading reveals that he doesn't say that it applies to the case in point. <i>The Economist</i> does its dirty job, which is arguing that economic development is more important than preservation and keeps at least to the minimal ethical standard of not openly lying; Wikipedia editors are invited to read its articles attentively, and do the same. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComplainer_fb25.html" title="User:Complainer">Complainer</a> 21:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried to remove some of the <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a> language in the Economist bit. However, I'm not convinced that we need this part at all. Alongside scientific journals, it seems to imply that there is scientific disagreement about this species. That may be, except, as the above comment notes, the Economist piece doesn't actually present any scientists disagreeing. So it appears that this is actually <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">unattributed</a> conjecture, and really not bringing any information to this Wikipedia article. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 23:10, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>At the very least, I don't think <i>The Economist</i> qualifies as enough of a <i>domain expert</i> to justify the inclusion of their speculation in the <i>lead</i>! A brief mention later on in the article might be reasonable to help ensure that all points of view are represented, but putting it in the lead gives their inexpert innuendo undue weight, in my opinion. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 22:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Economist may be a respectable journal (whatever that means) but, again, the content of their coverage does not actually link the Bornean Clouded Leopard with species inflation, it simply mentions both in the same article, as innuendo. We are under no obligation here to represent their statement if they aren't even drawing upon a primary source that explicitly makes the connection, and if they (as non-biologists) can't be expected to be a reliable primary source for that kind of assertion. As to Complainer's comment, editors here are obliged to act civilly toward one another, but Compainer did not say "you are a raving neoliberal". The statement may not have furthered this discussion, but it is a general opinion that editor may express, and not an attack against other Wikipedia editors. I don't presume to lecture you on policy, Chris, you've been here longer than I, and I admit that I may be wrong about this. It's just my opinion that we needn't be so careful to avoid offending people who aren't even here (the editors of The Economist). <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 20:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done some work on this too, including contacting the WWF — they must be impressed they've now received contacts from three separate Wikipedians&#160;:) Anyway, I also contacted the Clouded Leopard Project, and they very generously said they <i>would</i> be willing to help if they acquired an image (which might happen sometime in April).
