<p>Generally, we do not protect the featured article except for very short bursts.

<p>Greetings, oh Queen of the Borg.

In other words, I have unintentionally shortened your block (since the shortest block — mine — wins). Sorry about that. On the other hand, indefinite seems a bit extreme to me. How about a compromise: would you like to undo my block and give him a week, with my blessing?

<p>Hi, I posted a definition for the the term "The Nuggets" that stated: Jonathon Banco. Requires inordinate amounts of rest and frequents ski boot stores. Seemingly both infatuated with, and terrified of, "the ladies." There may have been somtheing else in there too. This is an accurate definition of my friend, commonly referred to as The Nuggets. I understand Wikepedia doesn't want people filling up space with definitions of their friends however. Just wondering a) how you found that so quickly and b) if you guys wouldn't mind, not deleting the next time I post this message for maybe, 1 to 2 days, so at least I can alert my friends to its existence, before it is deleted.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You made a strange change recently at the Jack Vance entry. Someone had it seems redirected a link to THE FACE (the magazine) and you changed it to THE FACE (a novel). Problem is, it is not the correct novel although the title fits. The one you linked to is by Dean Koontz, not Jack Vance. At the entry of the magazine at least Jack Vance is mentioned at the bottom as one of two writers who has written a novel by that title.</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you banned the IP 62.236.76.8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:62.236.76.8" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:62.236.76.8" rel="nofollow">see talk page</a>.</p>
<p>I am sure you did it for the right reasons, but the IP in question is not someone's private IP, it's an IP of the central internet connection server (proxy) of the educational network of our city. That means that there are tens or hundreds of thousands users in libraries, schools, universities etc.</p>
<p>I want to know is it possible to contribute in Wikipedia from the computers connected to the educational network? There are people who are of good will and want to contribute to Wikipedia, but is it now impossible from the city's computers?</p>
<p>What would you suggest for solution? I checked out the FAQ's and couldn't find an answer. --<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppelshine_326f.html" title="User:Appelshine">Appelshine</a> 08:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I see. But if someone decides to vandalize Wikipedia, say, from a public computer from a library, and happens so that the IP is banned temporarily. I sincerely hope that wouldn't happen, but there's always the possibility. What could be done to let the "honest" people to contribute to Wikipedia? What would you suggest? --<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppelshine_326f.html" title="User:Appelshine">Appelshine</a> 08:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I can only suggest that they use a non-shared IP. Currently Wikipedia has no technical feature that allows "innocent" users to contribute when their shared IP is blocked, as far as I am aware of. It causes a lot of headache for admins as much as it does for contributers who receive the collateral damage. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 08:55, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've unblocked 205.188.116.201 because it is an AOL proxy IP. Blocking it will not do much good, because the vandal can move on to other articles to evade the block.

<p>Hi, mighty Queen, it looks like you and I blocked 82.36.220.152 simultaneously. I only blocked for 3 hours, not because they don't deserve more, but because most IPs are dynamic. Your call, feel free to remove both blocks and impose whatever you think best. (Note that if you remove mine, yours disappears too, so re-blocking would be necessary.) I'm fine with a longer block, especially if you have any way of telling the IP is static.

<dd>Oh and turn a blind eye to the frequent, often massive vandalism coming from the infamous IP? My recent blocks were no more than 3 hours at maximum, usually 1 hour or less, and if you look at the log closely, you will notice I have been trying to reduce block time, unblocking to see if the vandal is gone but blocking soon again, thanks to their stubborness.

But, here lies a great problem: we Indians are more than 1000000000 people – of course all Indians, but with a varied cultural background – India is like a sub-continent. Now, you have given an idea: I will discuss this at India portal, and if possible we may try to decide – but, I am sure the attempt is likely to fail simply because we have several dishes which are like our national dish. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 15:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And if it wasn't full of your usual invective, I might have let it stand, but as it is, I've written a comment proposing that your abuse campaign against dab be deleted on sight from AN/I from now on. The ArbCom dealt with dab's behavior as well as yours in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Antifinnugor_7c0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Antifinnugor">rfar on you</a>, you know.

Oh, oh, now don't forget to use the words "hate", "vandalizing", and "clique" about me when you reply, because that's what people are when they contradict you, right? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ノート</a> 11:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Most of those IP talk pages have been semiprotected because they were being persistently vandalized by the blocked users.

<p>So BorgQueen, please explain what warranted the continual deletion of the Vedic metal article? Is this perhaps a case of personal opinion interfearing? Apparently the grounds for the deletion of the original article a few weeks back was that 'it is an advertisement' - well thankyou for your 'guilty until proven innocent' stance. But that aside - when now presented with an article which was expanded tenfold, incorporating a number of bands from various countries, totally collapsing any 'advertisment' argument, it was again deleted without explination. What exactly is your problem with the Vedic metal article? The Vedic metal scene is the size of the Viking metal one almost - should I go attack that genre because clearly the bands mentioned there are only adverts? Obiously something other than logic is leading to this judgement, I would like to know exactly what this reasoning is. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastu_ae82.html" title="User:Vastu">Vastu</a> 16:52, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for your inquiry. First let me state that I personally found the concept of Vedic metal fascinating, and would like to see it grow so the young generation can enjoy the ancient wisdom of Vedas through the music. But the policy states that, once an article is deleted through AfD process, it is not to be created, and if it is created it is to be deleted under CSD G4, the recreation of deleted materials. If you have objections, I recommend you bring this issue to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>, where you can discuss with other users whether the article should be undeleted. Please let me know if you have any further question. I am glad some people cherish and care about Vedic metal, by the way. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 17:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thankyou for your reply, and sorry for my harsher tone earlier - it is just that from my perspective, the events that transpired looked something like this;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>article deleted for being about one band (assuming that I had been promoting them for personal or finincial gain?) - new article created incorporating bands from dfferent regions and recording companies - that article deleted by reversion (i.e. on the same grounds?!) - revelation that a vote was taken in my absence by only two people who didnt have sufficient knolwedge of the genre or motivation to defend it based on incomplete evidence that forbids the article from again being created - observation that other sub-genres like Viking metal arnt treated the same</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you can understand how this looked to me. User:Spearhead's comments for example about eliminating what he/she saw as a 'psuedo genre' are perticularily telling - is not <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking_metal.html" title="Viking metal">Viking metal</a> then a pseudo-genre? Most Vedic metal bands are united by death metal styles of music and vocals, and so the argument that there is nothing unifying about the genre (which is already unified by Vedic themes is it not?) could be challenged. When the first article was deleted, I had no idea for what reason it had happened - I suspected that some fellow Indian, ignorant of metal, had probably mistook it for some kind of westernised genre assotiating Hinduism with the occult, and deleted it - but as it happens, it was fellow metalheads who killed it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I created the article <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_rock.html" title="Indian rock">Indian rock</a> a while back in an attempt to provide a source of information on India's contribution to the rock scene, as part of my beliefs about cultural diversity and liberalism, and especially wanted to focus on metal, as that is under-represented even within this already internationally unrecognised scene. Now I am not sure if I will find time to challenge the deletion vote, and so, there will likely not be a Vedic metal article which the metal fans of the world can view in the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Template%7EHeavymetal_89c5.html" title="Template:Heavymetal">Template:Heavymetal</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> articles - something which would have brought knolwedge of the scene to international auidience, and helped artists/fans a little.</dd>

<p>You have blocked an ip address sometimes assigned to me by att. I'm contacting you via my work computer, which has a different ip address. I know that sometimes ip addresses are blocked because they are used by vandals, but it seems counterproductive to block shared ip addresses, since the chances are that ip address will be randomly assigned to people who don't deserve to be blocked while the vandal will be randomly assigned a different ip address and can continue to post.

<p>This IP is a school. I attend it, so I am representing it to see it gets unblocked. Sure, some people will vandalize, but it is not right to punish us all for what a few of us do. Is it possible to just allow edits from logged in users from this IP? If so, I think this would be a solution, because you can then block specific users who vandalize, not everyone who uses the IP. Thank you.

<dd>I think other admins explained it well on your talk page. No, there is no way to allow only logged in users using the IP. Please contact the network admin of your school and come up with some solution before we unblock it because — in case you haven't noticed — almost all edits from the IP are pure vandalism. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 01:02, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Queen, I thank you for reverting the nasty edits from a nice person on my page. Had it been there it would not have made much difference, as some people are prone to give in to anger very soon, particularly when they do not understand that the reason for acting in any particular way. Actually, they are "uneducated" persons and require sympathy. May God Bless them and their parents who raised such brilliant kids! --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 11:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
