<p>Borghunter,</p>
<p>I received your message about the article "Bouncing back" that I posted. However, it shouldn't be a copyright violation, as I'm the same person who wrote the Amazon review -- I wanted to create a page for Bouncing Back but didn't have time to write another piece all over again, so I simply posted my own review of it on Wikipedia. (I credited myself for it too, so it wouldn't look like I just stole a random person's review.) How do you take the copyright stuff away and put the original article back? If it's a problem leaving the article as is, I'm happy to change it to a more encyclopedic-style piece.</p>
<p>thanks, Shane Stein</p>

<p>Well, when going through dozens of CSDs, with more being added by the second, it's hard to give too much attention to any of them, if your goal is to actually process all that are listed, so, no, I didn't check the talk page. It was a borderline case, certainly, but a really bad article. If you or anyone else wants to write a half decent stub on it, it shouldn't be speedied. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Kohan" id="Kohan"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kohan</span></h2>
<p>Well I wasn't actually bold, I was just curious what would happen, since I knew something would, so here the reasons why to use <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohan.html" title="Kohan">Kohan</a> instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article names should not include undertitles, since they are usually not used when you talk about the games. In this case it could help to differ between the meanings of Kohan, but it would be inconsistent and Kohan (computer game) is also a choice.</li>
<li>It is a series, <i>Kohan: Ahriman's Gift</i> is actually an Add-On to <i>Kohan</i>, but can be played without it (just like <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_aade.html" title="Serious Sam">Serious Sam</a> TFE and TSE) and there is a real successor, <i>Kohan II</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is the reason why I would propose Kohan for the article page instead of the disambig page. The Kohan series doesn't warrant several articles for the two (or three) titles (and likely the series will continue). Listing all the titles in the disambig page is not a solution, either we leave <a href="../../../i/m/m/Kohan%7E_Immortal_Sovereigns_ca14.html" title="Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns">Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns</a> as is and link to it in the series article Kohan (computer game) or change the disambig to the series page and put a "if you were searching for the priest, see <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohen.html" title="Kohen">Kohen</a>" on top. The latter is what I would prefer because the game series is more important in my eyes than an almost never used singular of Kohanim. Actually as I understood it, Kohan is plain wrong and Kohen is the correct singular of Kohanim.</p>
<p>Also, I don't see what's wrong with moving the content if you state where it came from (as I did). The history is <b>not</b> lost, everyone who wants to look at it can just go to <a href="../../../i/m/m/Kohan%7E_Immortal_Sovereigns_ca14.html" title="Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns">Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns</a>. I don't like putting this up for <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, but I will at least copy the content back from <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohan.html" title="Kohan">Kohan</a> to <a href="../../../i/m/m/Kohan%7E_Immortal_Sovereigns_ca14.html" title="Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns">Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns</a> because your revert "deleted" the changes I made to it. -- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarklock_444c.html" title="User:Darklock">Darklock</a> 10:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wasn't merely "mentioned."

<dd>That's an accurate description of what she did - she put her name on a book that was written by someone else. Whether it was ghostwritten in whole or in part is beside the point. Clinton didn't write it. She isn't an author and the original article section described her inaccurately as a "prolific author". She isn't an author, prolific or otherwise. She is a famous politician who sells books because of who she is, not how she writes. There's nothing wrong with that and she certainly isn't the only one to do it, but it is noteworthy and it certainly isn't derogatory to point it out - along with her break from custom with regard to crediting ghostwriters. It isn't controversial, it is simply an observation of factual events. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 21:31, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And, incidentally, whether this is proper or no, no matter who actually wrote a work, proper English says that whoever's name on the cover is the author, and, ergo, "wrote" that work. Thus, it is proper to call the book "hers," no matter who actually wrote it. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 00:51, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm talking about all her books. To the best of my knowledge, she hasn't yet written one of her own. Again, that isn't unusual for politicians, but what is unusual is that she doesn't credit her ghostwriters properly. You can say that 'Living History' is "her book" in the sense that he is credited to her on the cover, but you can't accurately say that she actually wrote it or that she is a "prolific author". --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 06:49, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, what's unreasonable is assuming something without evidence. Until you provide a source that says her column is ghostwritten, the article should say she wrote it. Innocent until proven guilty.

<dd>Meh. Well the advice I have at the moment is if you find yourself blocked with an IP block is to request an unblock or wait until you get home. I think the admins would unblock the ip for a registered user there, and could reblock when you were done. The problem is the folks doing the vandalism are pretty prolific (if I remember this mornings fun correctly) so that's potentially a ton of work for those of us on RC patrol if they notice they are unblocked.</dd>
<dd>FWIW the block this morning was only 15 minutes, and I didn't see any continued vandalism after that...tho I also didn't check if BorgHunter made any edits after the block wore off either. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 23:32, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nostradamus</span></h2>
<p>Borg, thank you for your help with the Nostradamus article. That page is a damn mess. I'm obviously on the skeptical side, but I think that both sides are crossing NPOV (although not to an equal degree). I've been kind of trying to think like a lawyer in how I've handled the situation. I've been trying to edit as little as possible, proposing solutions (reserving the Nostradamus page for biography and splitting the debate into a separate page a la validity of astrology, let me know what you think), and thinking about how what I say would look in the context of mediation or arbitration.</p>
<p>As an expert on Nostradamus, I don't think that the "quality" of the page article is anywhere near balanced. The page is a mess - with references to Jews as "Swine" and the obvious POV. Also, I would appreciate it if those with knowledge of astrology have their revisions added - rather than by those claiming POV of others, while clearly blind to their own POV. Being a skeptic is good - that's where I started, but being clearly POV and biased is not. And that is certainly not NPOV.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 17:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm new here and you seem experienced and involved, so I wanted your opinion as to the best strategy for handling this dispute and disputes in general.

<dd>I absolutely agree. And I think you're doing a great job trying to head off a bad edit war at the pass, which is what I've been after as well. I'm not sure I'd support a split—but it's an idea. I think all users right now have agreed to quit editing the page and discuss the issue for a bit, which is a step in the right direction. I might go so far as to say that Theodore is in grave danger of violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (or has already) if he continues with his edits the way he has, but at least he's not doing so at the moment. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> (another Borg!) has him up on the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">3RR reporting page</a> for a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violation on another article, so an admin may step in and tell him to cool his jets. He violated it on the Nostradamus article too, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed good <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> and mere ignorance of the policy, and didn't report him. We'll see how the situation turns out.</dd>
<dd>It's also too early to be looking at arbitration, as that is a last resort only. A RfC or RfM is a distinct possibility if we can't work it out, but I think it would be in the best interests of Wikipedia if we steered away from engaging too many people on the issue. I can forsee a nasty edit war culminating in protection of the page, and I don't want that. If we can work it out without a Rf*, then that'd be the ideal solution.</dd>
<dd>Good work so far, Mr. Heel. See you around. (P.S. Could you create a user page for yourself, please?

<dd>I'd be happy to offer any advice you want, however.

<p>Sorry, what exactly are you warning me for?</p>
<p>I moved a page with consensus on the talk page. Another editor reverted the move by cut and pasting it to try to circumvent the need for admin intervention, which he knew would not support him. He forgot to C&amp;P the talkpage so it's still on the right title.</p>
<p>I and another editor have both reverted RJII within policy. What on earth are you warning me for? Are you suggesting that I should simply have carried on reverting and just not bothered you with the other guy's trashing the policy.</p>
<p>The article is a mess because RJII c&amp;p'd it back to the old title.</p>
<p>Please unprotect the article and block the user as requested. He has reverted many times more than three, and been warned and asked to stop. By protecting his version and warning another editor who has stayed strictly within the bounds of the policy, you have endorsed his action.

<p>Please don't talk down to me. I'm well aware of what the template says.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">3RR case (RJII)</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to ask for some more input on the 3RR case with RJII. If you look at the talk page for the article <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>, you'll find a clear consensus that the article should either be rewritten to reflect the actual usage of the term "economic fascism" or the article should be renamed so that its contents are accurately reflected by its title. James James performed the rename and RJII reverted at least six times in the past 24 hours. There is clear consensus for the move, and literally nobody agrees with RJII's position, but he continues to revert.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what protecting the article and asking for further discussion will do. The issue has been discussed extensively, a RfC was made, a consensus emerged, and RJII has fought it every step of the way and will continue to do so. He is currently using past comments by an admin as a shield, because early in the dispute <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">User:Firebug</a> was redirecting the article to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a> with no merge. Those comments are no longer relevant - this is a move with consensus, not a redirect without merge.</p>

<dd>Well, a RfC isn't necessarily binding. The issue obviously isn't entirely resolved. I think a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">request for arbitration</a> would be appropriate, unfortunately. It's a shame every time such a step has to be taken, but sometimes it's necessary. 3RR blocks are only for 24 hours max anyway. If such a step is taken, please notify me, incidentally. If you and your side decline to take a RfAr, all I can do is really block for 3RRs and not much else. Again, I strongly urge a RfAr to settle the matter once and for all. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 06:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't gone anywhere near breaking the policy, nor would I. I don't know why you are warning me for doing three reverts. I'm perfectly entitled to.</p>
<p>I'm really upset that you have decided to support a user who has trashed the policy. What's the point for editors like me of abiding by the policy and trying to work with consensus for NPOV articles when an admin rewards an editor who has taken ownership of a page, reverts it NINE times and refuses to take note of consensus? If you actually read the discussion page, you'd see that I and several other editors have tried to discuss the page with RJII, but he shouts down all other opinions. There is a clear consensus for a move to a different name and I acted on that. I'm astonished that not only have you supported him in reverting many more than three times but that you protected the page on one of the reverts that breached the policy. In effect, as I say, you've rewarded him for doing it. I know what the box says but please, use your common sense. You clearly endorse his action by not reverting him before protecting the page because his version is the most recent because he breached 3RR and I would not!</p>
<p>The message you've given him is that it's perfectly okay to do that. Please block RJII as requested and unprotect the page so that other editors can work on it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 05:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've read 3RR. I know what it says about entitlements. I was talking generally, meaning rather that I'm entitled not to be blocked (or warned) for reverting if I haven't breached it. Please stop talking down to me. It's really irritating. I rarely get involved in reverting signed-in editors but his botched move made a real mess.

<dd>He just needs to be blocked so that the mess he's made of the versions can be sorted out. It also needs the article to be unprotected to do that. The 3RR policy also mentions that some admins will not protect to the version that has been created by the excessive reverter. The arbcom doesn't need to rule on his reverting. It's perfectly okay just to block him for that. I won't be adding anything to the arbcom case. I don't think he needs broader censure. He just needs a reminder that other editors are allowed to edit articles he works on. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 06:21, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't <i>have</i> to block RJII for the 3RR. It's admin discretion whether to block or not. Moreover, another admin came to the same conclusion I did. And also, because TomTheHand pointed out that a RfAr involving RJII is already in progress, I think that blocking him would be inappropriate. As such, unprotecting the article is not feasible.

<dd>Thank you for being so understanding with me. I understand your side, and I agree, you've followed policy pretty well. Perhaps in my attempts to be as impartial as possible I've inadvertantly skewed towards the side of the "guilty" party, a more or less de facto devil's advocate. I don't know. If I get some notes from admins saying they think it's best to unprotect the pages, I will. Yours is not an unreasonable request; I just don't know if it's for the best.</dd>

<dd>I think you did just fine. I would've kept both pages protected and let them haggle it out, but I understand why you unprotected them. My 2 rules of protection are...never take sides and emphasize to the parties that by protecting a page, we are never taking sides. We aren't ruling one side "correct", which is why I think you were justified in protecting the fork and the main article. That way, you were not picking one version over the other. The other thing is that make sure you make the combatants realize that they might not see a dispute, but if just one person doesn't go with the consensus, then they need to try to discuss the situation with that person and try to get them to come to an agreement that everyone is ok with. That isn't something you really did, but you'll learn how to do that. "I don't see a dispute!" Well of course they don't, because they think their side is 100% right. Overall, you did just fine. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 06:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Next time, I'd keep the pages protected and let them work it out. And if you don't like blocking people, I'd suggest just putting it up on 3RR or AN/I and let others do it.

<dd>I didn't suggest his arguments were invalid because he reverted the article nine times. I simply suggested he should be blocked for it. His arguments are invalid because there is a consensus to fix the article. Did you read the talkpage? I'm guessing you absolutely did not because you would not say that if you had. If you had done so, you'd see a <i>great deal</i> of discussion with RJII, from many quarters. That you would protect a POV fork of an article without reading it, and without reading the discussion, is quite astonishing.</dd>

Posting on the AN/3RR isn't a mandate for action; it only alerts admins to the situation, to which they act in a manner they believe to be appropriate. And RJII certainly has a number of pairs of eyes on him, including mine. If he reverts the 3RR elsewhere, and I get to him first, I won't be so lenient with him. I would have blocked him on the spot, in fact, had I known about his history of this (which I did not, my fault). All in all, it's a pretty ugly situation.

<p>Note that this user, as soon as his block expired, began to make changes back to the version he was reverting to. I've asked him to collaborate and to bring major changes to talk, but to no avail. His response is to call me "disruptive" and refuse to discuss his edits. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 06:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC) Note the James is deleting my edits without stated reasons. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:09, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I gave reasons on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Talk%7EEconomics_of_fascism_8793.html" title="Talk:Economics of fascism">the talkpage</a>. I have invited RJII to discuss his edits there. He thinks this is "disrupting" Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 06:13, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
