<dd>One of the many advantages of <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_version_6_9448.html" title="IP version 6">IP version 6</a>'s huge address space potentially is to solve this by better use of route aggregation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>because it's not really true, and it would be confusing to explain why in a page that's basically about something else.</p>
<p>There is no mechanism associated with that larger address space that is explicitly designed to reduce the size of routing tables. In fact, the larger address space would allow for <b>larger</b> routing tables if it is not managed properly.</p>
<p>The two issues (address space size, and degree of aggregation) are totally orthogonal.</p>
<p>There <i>is</i> a mechanism that is part of IPv6 that might provide some help, the fast renumbering stuff. However, for that to be of any use, people must be willing to renumber their networks, to produce greater aggregation in the routing tables, and there is no empirical evidence that this will actually happen. However, this has little to do with the size of the address (only that large addresses allow use of hardware derived low-order parts - except that this is now deprecated on privacy grounds).</p>
<p>Similarly, if Multi6 actually agrees on a mechanism, and it gets OK'd by the IPv6 community, and it is adopted, implemeneted, and deployed, then that would help too - but again, this has nothing to do with the size of addresses. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 20:55, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"path vector".. don't you mean "vector routing protocol"? I am not confident enough to edit it myself.</p>
<p>Rembering my courses on BGP, I think that it's been given many names, e.g. depending on whether people wanted to insult it (for marketing reasons e.g). It's a kind of vector routing protocol (since it only knows next hop and a kind of sophisticated cost, it doesn't know the whole link through to the end) but it's really much more than a vector routing protocol since beyond direction and fixed cost, it also knows the "ASPATH" which lists the networks that will be traversed in that direction. This allows political decisions (I would rather my traffic didn't go across ZUZONET since they monitor traffic). That's why it is sometimes called something like a "path vector" protocol <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=path+vector+protocol" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=path+vector+protocol" rel="nofollow">see Google... first several links look good</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 05:59, 2004 May 27 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"path vector" is the proper term, invented by Yakov Rekhter distinguish it from "destination vector" protocols such as RIP. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 20:57, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was not sufficiently precise above, I wrote in haste, sorry. "path vector" is a sub-set of "destination vector". Note also that "<b>distance</b> vector"&#160;!= "<b>destination</b> vector".</dd>
<dd>All "destination vector" means is that the data that is passed from one router to another is a table (vector) of information about destinations; about basically (modulo policy constraints) <i>all</i> destinations, in fact. (Think of it as the complete routing table.) Contrast this with <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link-state_routing.html" title="Link-state routing">link-state routing</a> (which I recently re-wrote in a major way to provide a precise, and hopefully readable, description), which is <b>fundamentally</b> radically different.</dd>
<dd>BGP does carry the complete AS path for each destination (for loop-prevention as well as making it available for policy decisions - initially the former was the more important, but nowadays the latter is), so your statement ("it doesn't know the whole link through to the end") isn't quite correct - yes, the BGP information doesn't specify each individual router in the path, but it does show which AS's are in the path which packets to that destination will take.</dd>
<dd>(Sigh, I need to redo the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destination-vector_routing.html" title="Destination-vector routing">destination-vector routing</a> page too, and also <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance-vector_routing.html" title="Distance-vector routing">distance-vector routing</a>, to make them all equally precise. The history of the terminology is a little confusing. At first there was only "distance" vector, which implied that the <i>only</i> data in each element of the vector, other that the destination identity, was a single metric, the "distance". [That's very ancient terminology, I'd have to do some research to track down its source.] Then Yakov came up with the PV term to emphasize that each vector element included an entire path. So then we started calling the entire class "destination" vector [in part so that the "DV" acronym didn't have to change&#160;;-] to emphasize that its <b>fundamental</b> nature - as opposed to LS - hadn't changed. You still gave your neighbour the entire routing table, and the <i>path selection</i> computation was still a distributed one, as opposed to LS, where the entire path-selection algorithm runs in parallel on each node.)</dd>
<dd>I hope this makes things a bit clearer (until I get around to re-writing those two articles). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:40, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not all ISPs use BGP - smaller ISPs (eg tier 3) may be part of the upstream provider's AS. Unless someone objects, I'll soon amend the relevant text.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the secion on path selection is really about the BGP, or about a non-standardized algorithm for using the info that BGP provides. E.g. it says <i>Prefer the path with the highest weight (Only on Cisco routers)</i> but that would clearly not be in a standard. I see no use of the term 'path selection' in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271">RFC 4271</a>. Can someone who knows this stuff better address this? --<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENealmcb_9c01.html" title="User:Nealmcb">NealMcB</a> 00:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>⇒ &lt;SSPecteR&gt;</b> As far as I know, there is no standard for path selection in BSP. The criteria is free for the AS to choose. Someone confirm this. It would be nice to have a section with general preferences to determine the best path. But how it is there (Quote: "<b>BGP</b> uses the following criteria ...") it is wrong. For now, Im taking this area off. <b>♠</b> Saturday, 2006-06-10, 06:22 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>⇒ The paths selection is totally up to the ASes, and in fact a certain set of preferences of the ASes in the network may cause route oscillations (that may never converge). It may be worthwhile to mention this. Here's a reference on this: Timothy G. Griffin, F. Bruce Shepherd, and Gordon Wilfong. Policy disputes in path-vector protocols. [Wed. December 20th 2006] <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.139.226.36_c593.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.139.226.36">128.139.226.36</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.139.226.36.html" title="User talk:128.139.226.36">talk</a>) 06:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd>⇒ Totally up to the ASes is not true. Furthermore route oscillations occur in case of misconfigurations of the set of preferences with the <b>complete</b> set of rules of the <b>standard</b> Route Selection. The set of preferences should be seen as the arguments of the function 'Route Selection'. The RFC4271 defines the rules to apply when performing the Route Selection (section 9.1.2.2). Having said that, it is true that vendors implement mechanisms which allow network operators to disable some rules. It should not be used. Each vendor has also specific rule(s) added to the standard ones.
