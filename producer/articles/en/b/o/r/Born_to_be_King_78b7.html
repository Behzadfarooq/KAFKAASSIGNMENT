<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/8/1486.html" title="1486">1486</a>, the second year of his reign and reportedly "<i>the year in which the egg replaced the worm as the lowest form of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a>"</i>, King Richard IV departed his Kingdom to join a new <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusade</a> against the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Prince Harry was appointed <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Regent_ff80.html" title="Prince Regent">Regent</a> for the duration of his absence. Edmund saw the event as his "<i>chance for some real power"</i>.</p>
<p>However the winter of <a href="../../../1/4/8/1486.html" title="1486">1486</a>/<a href="../../../1/4/8/1487.html" title="1487">1487</a> found Edmund flocking sheep. Harry at least bothered to personally inform him that their father would return by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_of_Noblac_7266.html" title="Leonard of Noblac">St. Leonard</a>'s Day and that there would be a common <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebration_%28party%29.html" title="Celebration (party)">celebration</a> for both events. Harry would handle the visiting Royals, the guards of honour and the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_legate.html" title="Papal legate">Papal legate</a> of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Innocent_VIII_650a.html" title="Pope Innocent VIII">Pope Innocent VIII</a> while Edmund was responsible for organising the festivities and attending to the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm_drain.html" title="Storm drain">storm drains</a>. Harry was already looking forward to being entertained by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_dance.html" title="Morris dance">Morris dancers</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/n/Eunuch.html" title="Eunuch">eunuchs</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearded_Lady_8b3e.html" title="Bearded Lady">bearded women</a>. Edmund pretended to be honoured by his appointment, but actually felt humiliated and enraged.</p>
<p>Edmund soon found difficulties with his new duties. The only available bearded woman had recently shaved her beard. He was also not particularly impressed when Lord Percy suggested hiring "The Jumping Jews of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>" whose sole entertainment value was that they jumped, "a lot." He was though somewhat intrigued to learn of the play <i>The Death of the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a></i> by Sir Dominick Prique and his <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thespian.html" title="Thespian">thespianic</a> <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troupe.html" title="Troupe">troupe</a>. Baldrick suggested the hiring of Jerry Meriwether and His Four Chickens. Their stated entertainment value was that they could lay eggs. Edmund was not impressed but agreed in order to avoid arguing with his advisor.</p>
<p>He was then enraged to find the eunuchs had turned down his offer. He reacted by sending an order for their <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">execution</a> to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chancellor_7301.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>. (The historical Lord Chancellor of the time was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Alcock_%28bishop%29_ba26.html" title="John Alcock (bishop)">John Alcock</a>). Harry was displeased to learn that there would be no eunuchs in a feast honouring a eunuch <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">Saint</a>. He also informed his brother that the expected Dougal McAngus, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess.html" title="Marquess">Marquess</a> of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kintyre.html" title="Kintyre">Kintyre</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorne%2C_Argyll_and_Bute_0618.html" title="Lorne, Argyll and Bute">Lorne</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-Chief_dd6e.html#United_Kingdom" title="Commander-in-Chief">Supreme Commander of the King's Army</a>, had a preference for eunuchs. Harry believed this to be due to the great warrior being <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a>.</p>
<p>Edmund soon commented to Lord Percy and Baldrick of his distaste for this Scottish <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangutan.html" title="Orangutan">orangutan</a>. He proceeded to state that the Scots were just <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbarians</a> since half of them couldn't speak the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>. (This was correct, as in the 15th century, while most lowland Scots spoke the dialect of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_English_5313.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a> that was evolving into <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots</a>, the Highlands were almost entirely <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_b039.html" title="Scottish Gaelic">Gaelic</a>-speaking.) Nevertheless, Edmund stated he would find suitable <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entertainer.html" title="Entertainer">entertainers</a>. He instructed Baldrick to get a nice dress and perform as a bearded lady. He was not surprised to find Baldrick excited over the idea. He also sent Lord Percy to hire Bernard the Bear Baiter and to make sure that this year he would actually come with a bear. (In the event, though, Bernard brought a rabbit.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_be_King_78b7.html" title="Edit section: First encounter with Dougal McAngus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First encounter with Dougal McAngus</span></h3>
<p>Dougal McAngus soon arrived with recently won Turkish treasures and news from the crusaders. He also transported the regards of his father to the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_consort.html" title="Queen consort">Queen consort</a>. (McAngus was unaware that during his journey to England his father had died and that he was now Fourth Duke of Argyll.) Harry then attempted to introduce Dougal to Edmund. With Dougal mistaking the younger Prince for a eunuch, the two got off to a bad start. When Edmund introduced himself as the Duke of Edinburgh, McAngus complained about the Duke being as Scottish as "<i>as the Queen of England 's tits "</i>.</p>
<p>Harry attempted to defuse the situation by informing McAngus that his heroic efforts in battle had won the favour of the King. His latest <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence.html" title="Correspondence">correspondence</a> instructed Harry to offer McAngus whatever he desired. Edmund was not pleased that Dougal asked for "<i>fair Selkirk, and the noble <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire.html" title="Shire">shire</a> of Roxburgh"</i>. Though commenting that those lands in fact belong to him, Edmund failed to make an impression on either Harry or Dougal. Complaining that these would only leave him with Peebles, only reminded McAngus to ask for Peebles too. At first commenting that: <i>"Well! What an absurd idea, giving away half of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to a <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilt.html" title="Kilt">kilted</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maniac.html" title="Maniac">maniac</a> for <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaughtering.html" title="Slaughtering">slaughtering</a> a couple of <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilitic</a> Turks!"</i>. However a little persuasion at swordpoint by McAngus was enough for Edmund to apparently change his mind.</p>
<p>Soon however, Edmund started scheming to attack McAngus "in the Great Hall, and in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Bladder.html" title="Bladder">bladder</a>". Percy expressed his concern that doing the deed "in front of everyone" would possibly cause them to... "suspect something". Baldrick suggested a "cunning plan" to get McAngus to stick his own head down a cannon and then blow it off. Edmund's gaze was caught by the poster advertising the above Egyptian play, and he developed a more "subtle" plan. He then, however, caught sight of McAngus going out on a hunting trip, and instead chose to follow the Scotsman hoping for an opportunity to expeditiously finish him off. Soon enough Edmund was literally caught in the snare of his rival.</p>
<p>Quick at improvising, Edmund offered McAngus the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> role in the performance of the <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_fiction.html" title="Mystery fiction">Mystery</a> play <i>The Death of the Scotsman</i> (the above mentioned <i>The Death of the Pharaoh</i> with a telling change of title). He would only need to learn "<i>acting dead"</i>. Dougal accepted and naturally Edmund arranged for a stage death for him.</p>
<p>On the night of the fateful performance however, Dougal approached Edmund to discuss with him. He revealed that the Third Duke of Argyll and the Queen were former <a href="../../../l/o/v/Lover.html" title="Lover">lovers</a>. He also claimed to have letters proving the affair and disputing the parentage of Harry. Seeing a chance of removing Harry from the line of succession, Edmund prevented the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a></p>
<p><a name="Claiming_the_throne" id="Claiming_the_throne"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_be_King_78b7.html" title="Edit section: Claiming the throne">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Claiming the throne</span></h3>
<p>Later, Edmund had the chance to examine the letters himself. They were dated <a href="../../../1/4/6/1460.html" title="1460">1460</a>, year of birth for his brother. McAngus even suggested to Edmund that: "<i>If you played your cards right, you could become King "</i>, and sooner than he thought. He claimed Richard IV was last seen entering <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> alone, armed with a fruit knife and facing 10,000 Turks armed with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scimitar.html" title="Scimitar">scimitars</a>.</p>
<p>Soon enough, an excited Edmund revealed the letters and their contents to the members of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_court.html" title="Royal court">Royal court</a>, claiming Harry to be illegitimate and the King deceased. Lord Percy was the first to shout "<i>The King is dead! Long live the King! "</i>. Edmund was living his greatest <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triumph.html" title="Triumph">triumph</a>. But at that moment Richard IV chose to return, claiming to have made it "<i>thanks to my trusty fruit knife!"</i>.</p>
<p>Edmund was surprised but did try to point the letters to his father. The letters however dated from November-December, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1460.html" title="1460">1460</a>, when Harry was already born. A smiling McAngus then pointed that this came about nine months before the birth of Edmund. Edmund was quick to claim the letters to be <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgery.html" title="Forgery">forgeries</a> and threw them to the fireplace. On the heat of the moment, Edmund also challenged McAngus (his possible half-brother) to a duel. Dougal was quick to accept and Richard was looking forward to the entertainment.</p>
<p>The duel was a short-lived one. McAngus managed to disarm Edmund with a single blow of the sword. The scene is possibly a spoof of one of the duel scenes in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Roy_bd9d.html" title="Rob Roy">Rob Roy</a>, in which the somewhat effeminate finesse of a supposedly English fighting style is contrasted with the brute strength of the Scots. In that duel, the English style won over. Here, however, Edmund's posturing simply reveals a ridiculous lack of prowess.</p>
<p>With a sword to his neck, Edmund begged for his life and offered everything he had to Dougal. "<i>I'm, I'm hardly a rich man. But, but my horse must be worth a thousand <a href="../../../d/u/c/Ducat.html" title="Ducat">ducats</a>. I can sell my <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wardrobe.html" title="Wardrobe">wardrobe</a> - the pride of my life - my swords, my curtains, my socks, and my <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockfight.html" title="Cockfight">fighting cocks</a>. My servants I can live without, except perhaps he who oils my <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rack_%28torture%29.html" title="Rack (torture)">rack</a>. And then my most intimate treasures: my collection of antique <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codpiece.html" title="Codpiece">codpieces</a>, my wigs for state occasions, my wigs for private occasions, and my wigs - heh - for humorous occasions; my collection of pokers, ...my autographed <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniature_%28illuminated_manuscript%29.html" title="Miniature (illuminated manuscript)">miniature</a> of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> "</i>.</p>
<p>McAngus at first pretended to be about to strike but then revealed his interest in the wigs. He did comment, though, "<i>I hope life doesn't become too dull now that you won't be able to pass laws over Scotland.</i>" Edmund's reply, inder his breath, was "<i>I wouldn't pass water over Scotland.</i>" A while later Edmund and Dougal were seen keeping company with Harry, believing them to have become firm friends. This was not so, however. Edmund went through with Baldrick's plan and McAngus died in an "accident" involving a cannon. Edmund had disposed of a possible <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-brother.html" title="Half-brother">half-brother</a> and a dangerous rival. (The episode was the only one to refer to Richard IV of England as also being "Richard XII of Scotland".</p>

<p>There was historically no King of Scotland named Richard. Scotland was at the time under <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_III_of_Scotland_e2d3.html" title="James III of Scotland">James III of Scotland</a>. The union between the thrones of England and Scotland would not occur until <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/0/1603.html" title="1603">1603</a>, when <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_of_Scotland_22b9.html" title="James VI of Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> succeeded <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>).

<p>The plot from <i>Born to be King</i> was originally used for the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Edmund_%28Blackadder_Pilot%29_92eb.html" title="Prince Edmund (Blackadder Pilot)">unaired pilot episode</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Second Episode, "Born to be King" is a remake of the original unaired pilot: with the following differences: The King is not at the crusades, but at home. Edmond's plot to kill McAngus involves a hanging with a fake rope, not a staged stabbing with a real dagger. the plan backfires in much the same way. The King, Prince Henry and Baldrick are played by different actors, respectively <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Savident_e577.html" title="John Savident">John Savident</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bathurst_a39f.html" title="Robert Bathurst">Robert Bathurst</a> and Philip Fox. Edmund's personality is much more like his descendants in the other series, much more sarcastic and intelligent. Various details are changed, of course, as well.</li>
<li>This episode marks the first time that Baldrick says "I have a cunning plan."</li>
<li>The "play within a play" may be a tribute to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>.</li>
