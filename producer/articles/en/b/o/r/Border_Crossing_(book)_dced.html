<p>When Tom Seymour, a child psychologist, plunges into a river to save a young man from drowning, he unwittingly reopens a chapter from his past he'd hoped to forget. For Tom already knows Danny Miller. When Danny was ten Tom helped imprison him for the killing of an old woman. Now out of prison with a new identity, Danny has some questions- questions he thinks only Tom can answer.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Tom is drawn back into Danny's world- a place where the border between good and evil, innocence and guilt is blurred and confused. But when Danny's demands on Tom become extreme, Tom wonders whether he has crossed a line of his own- and in crossing it, can he ever go back?</p>

<p>The events of <i>Border Crossing</i> are quite possibly inspired by a particularly tragic murder case that took place in Britain in 1993.<br />
On February 12 of that year, two-year-old <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bulger_5e73.html" title="James Bulger">James Bulger</a> was taken from his mother's side whilst at the supermarket, and pelted to death with stones at a railway line. The two murderers were found to be Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, both ten years old.<br /></p>
<p>The case caused considerable controversy both in Britain and worldwide. Just like Danny in <i>Border Crossing,</i> Thompson and Venables were tried and sentenced as adults.</p>

<p><i>Border Crossing</i> opens with Tom Seymour and his wife Lauren strolling along a deserted river path. They pass the derelict remnants of their decaying neighbourhood, with numerous buildings awaiting demolition or already burnt to the ground, and litter strewn across the path. They stop to observe a young man pause at the edge of a pier, swallow a handful of pills and disappear into the depths of the icy-cold river.<br />
Tom sprints to the boy's aid and, after a moment's hesitation, dives in after him. After dragging the unconscious boy back towards the bank of the river, Lauren helps to drag the boy out of the water.<br />
The boy is not breathing, so they perform CPR. After Tom detects a pulse, Lauren rushes back to the house to call an ambulance, which arrives promptly. The parametics establish that the drowned boy is now stable, and they load him into the ambulance van to be taken to hospital.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>"... the woman, fair-haired, wearing a beige coat that faded into the gravel, and talking, always talking. Though the red lips move, no sound comes out. He denies her his attention in memory, as he did in life."</i></li>
<li><i>"A second later, the water enclosed [Tom] in a coffin of ice."</i></li>
<li><i>"[Lauren's] eyes were glazed, inward-looking. Like labour, Tom thought, the irony as sour as the mud on his tongue."</i></li>
<li><i>"The boy looked like a baby: purple face, wet hair, that drowned look of the newborn, cast up on to its mother's suddenly creased and spongy belly."</i></li>

<p>Tom and Lauren arrive back home, and Lauren prepares a hot bath. The couple retreat to bed, for the first time in months not worrying about Lauren's menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Afterwards, Tom deserts a frustrated Lauren and drinks whisky, fully aware that she had not climaxed.<br />
Tom discovers that he'd unknowingly traded coats with the boy he'd rescued, and, realising that his mail and a pair of spare keys were in his coat, he travels to the hospital to retrieve it. The nurse informs Tom that the boy's name is Ian Wilkinson, though the boy introduces himself to Tom as Danny Miller. Tom had evaluated Danny when he was just ten years old and, just ten months ago, Danny had been released from prison under a false identity.<br />
Tom immediately wonders if their remarkable meeting was chance, or "a dramatic gesture gone badly, almost fatally, wrong."</p>

<p>Tom and Lauren have an argument. Despite frequent attempts, Tom is unable to get Lauren pregnant. Tom feels used and inadequate, and Lauren as if her time is running out. Lauren leaves for work for the week, after announcing that she will not be coming home for the next weekend.<br />
Tom reviews some past child case histories for a book that he is writing. Michelle, ten years old, had bitten off the nose of her foster mother's natural daughter. Jason, showing not a hint of remorse, had lit a fire in which four people had died.<br />
After several hours of research, Tom meets Roddy Taylor, the director of a medium-security child institution, for lunch. Tom tells him about his inability to get Lauren pregnant, though he suspects that, through Lauren and his wife, Roddy already knows this.</p>

<p>Tom reads over the report he'd written many years ago, when he'd evaluated a ten-year-old Danny at the remand centre. He'd been unprepared for the sight of such a young boy, knowing that he had committed the murder of an elderly lady named Lizzie Parks.<br />
Tom speaks softly, asking Danny simple questions to get the session started. After several hours, Tom establishes several significant ideas about Danny's emotional maturity. Danny believes that a person's death is somewhat unimportant, because <i>"thousands of people get killed all the time, all over the world."</i> He concedes that Lizzie Parks' death is important, but not a lot, because <i>"she'd had her life."</i> Danny reveals that he still suffered from her death, sleeping badly, having nightmares, suffering flashbacks, that everything around him seemed unreal. All this time, Danny maintains his innocence. Throughout the session, Tom observes Danny deliberately mimicking Tom's actions, possibly an early sign of Danny's attempts at manipulation.<br />
As Tom is about to leave the session, Danny throws his arms around Tom, who is surprised, but doesn't reject the gesture. As Tom leaves the building, the warder remarks to him, <i>"Well, he is a horror, isn't he?"</i> Based upon the results of his evaluation, Tom decides that Danny possesses a full understanding of death as a permanent state, and recommends that Danny stand trial for murder in an adult's court.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>"Danny wasn't deceived. He knew the hard questions were coming, and that here too there would be nobody else to answer them."</i></li>
<li><i>"He was an arrogant little bastard."</i></li>
<li><i>"You wring a chicken's neck, you don't expect to find it running round the yard next morning, do you?"</i></li>
<li><i>"The forensic evidence for Danny's guilt was overwhelming, but he was a good liar."</i></li>
<li><i>"A double reflection of the flame appeared in [Danny's] eyes, whose pupils had not contracted, as one would have expected, but grown large, as if starved of light."</i></li>
<li><i>"Could Danny distinguish between fantasy and reality? Did he understand that killing was wrong? Did he understand that death is a permanent state? Was he, in short, capable of standing trial, on a charge of murder, in an adult court? And to all these questions Tom had answered, Yes. Not without doubt, not without qualification, not without many hours of soul searching but, in the end, Yes."</i></li>

<p>Tom has an usual dream, beginning with a meeting with his father, who is deceased, and ending with his father's figure morphing into various random objects and a voice whispering, <i>"That's what a great love comes to- a rabbit running between graves."</i><br />
The following day, Tom visits his mother for lunch, evoking further memories of his father. His mother, still grieving for her husband after several years, denies any difficulties, though Tom observes that she was withering quickly in the absence of physical love.<br />
Before setting off home, Tom visits a pond he'd play in as a child of ten years. He and a friend, Jeff Bridges, had been looking for frog spawn all day, though they'd been given the unwanted responsibility of looking after Neil, the four-year-old son of some friends of Jeff's parents.<br />
After playing "piggy in the middle" in the garden for about twenty minutes, they'd ignored their parents' warnings and had visited the pond, rumoured to have a flooded well in the centre of it. One of them had placed frog spawn in Neil's wellington boots, and Neil panicked, screaming and crying and slowly backing into the depths of the pond. Desperate to keep him quiet, Tom and Jeff began to throw stones in Neil's direction, and they splashed around him.<br />
A man on a bus, glancing up from his paper, witnessed this spectacle and came to Neil's aid, preventing what might have escalated into a horrific death.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>"It started as a joke. A cruel joke, yes, but still a joke."</i></li>
<li><i>"Jeff threw the first stone. Tom was sure about that. Almost sure."</i></li>
<li><i>"Why did they do it? Because they were frightened, because they shouldn't have been there at all, because they knew they were going to get into trouble, because they hated him, because he was a problem they couldn't solve, because neither could be the first to back down."</i></li>
<li><i>"Three children were saved that day."</i></li>
<li><i>"What interested him was how little sense of responsibility he felt now."</i></li>
<li><i>"In spite of the connecting thread of memory, the personal who'd done that was not sufficiently like his present self for him to feel guilt."</i></li>

<p>Danny arrives at Tom's house for his first planned consultation with Tom, though it is slightly more informal than that. Danny explains his difficulties upon being released from prison. He had met a girl, though had broken it off rather than risking her reaction after finding out about his past. He had also been raped in prison, a startingly intimate revelation which Tom attributes to Danny's distinct lack of sense of normal social distance and pacing.<br />
Danny details his ambitions of being a teacher, and how the law prohibits him from working with people. Frustrated with his life, Danny had returned to the prison, and Martha Pitt, his payroll officer, had collected him from the waiting room.<br />
Danny decides that he wants to continue his consultations with Tom, in order to understand <i>"what happened and why."</i> He reveals his belief that their meeting was not an accident, but fate, though Tom is still suspicious of the circumstances.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>"Looking through the peephole, he saw Danny, trapped in the distorting glass, like a fish in a bowl."</i></li>
<li><i>"What was back, without effort, without his wanting it even, was the intimacy of that first meeting."</i></li>
<li><i>"Tom kept using words like 'intimacy' and 'closeness' to describe the atmosphere of the meeting, but there'd also been massive antagonism."</i></li>
<li><i>"You see the real question is: can people change?"</i></li>

<dd>A child psychologist, and the central character of the third-person narrative, Tom originally proclaimed Danny capable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and of understanding the notion of death as a permanent state. Tom's testimony in court effectively ensured that Danny was tried as an adult, despite being only ten years old, and sentenced to ten years in juvenile prison for the murder of Lizzie Parks.<br /></dd>
<dd>Years later, when he next encounters Danny, Tom is also suffering from the breakdown of his marriage to Lauren. Tom feels disconnected from Lauren, and resents being treated as a <i>"sperm bank"</i> in their failed attempts to have children.

<li><b>Crossing Borders:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>"It was extraordinarily distracting: this feeling of a pivotal moment in his own life being played out in front of an uninvited audience."</i></li>
<li><i>"...Tom was aware of a line being crossed."</i></li>
<li><i>"[Danny] was very, very good at getting people to step across that invisible border. Lambs to the slaughter."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mist/Fog:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>"They'd awoken that morning to a curious stillness. Clouds sagged over the river, and there was mist like sweat over the mudflats."</i></li>
<li><i>"[Tom] was less than halfway across the causeway when the mist thickened."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Smoke/Fire:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>"The fired burnt furiously, piled high with logs. Danny had dragged the log basket onto the hearth rug and was kneeling beside it, a log in each hand, watching the fire burn."</i></li>
<li><i>"Danny's face was veiled in smoke."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
