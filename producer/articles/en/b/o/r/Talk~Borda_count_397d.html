<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Talk%7EBorda_count_397d.html" title="Edit section: intro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">intro</span></h2>
<p><i>Note: this is content moved from the <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Charles_de_Borda_68c5.html" title="Jean-Charles de Borda">Jean-Charles de Borda</a> page. Does not represent my opinion at all -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobLa_2262.html" title="User:RobLa">RobLa</a></i></p>
<p><a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting.html" title="Voting">Voting</a> is something that has been used for a very long time, so obviously it is the best way right. Wrong, simple voting can be modified and made a lot better. Written sources attest the existence of voting procedures all through the middle Ages. Confusion in choosing the right system was common, nobody really knew what was best for them. In 1130, for example, the ambiguity of voting led to the election of two Popes, an event that created a rift within the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In June of <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a> a French <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematician.html" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> named <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Charles_de_Borda_68c5.html" title="Jean-Charles de Borda">Jean-Charles de Borda</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/3/1733.html" title="1733">1733</a>-<a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>), who was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, proposed a new method of voting. He noted irregularies in the qualifications of members being elected to the Academy. He suggested that voters rank the candidates, and in turn assigning the candidates points on how they prefer them. For example, in a 3-candidate election, the first ranked on a ballot received 2 points, the second obtained 1, and the third ranked got 0 points. The candidate with the most points won.</p>
<p>There are many ups and downs of each way of voting, but at the time, The Borda Method was the most appealing. But mathematicians found the answer; they have bad and good news for the voting population. The bad news is Borda's count 2,1,0 is not ideal; it can still lead to distorted results. The good news: within the point method, the Borda count is by far the best. Moreover, our voting rule 1,0,0 is the worst; it gives the least amount of information about what voters want and can yield results that speak against the people's will.</p>
<p>This becomes clear from the following examples. In 1970 the centre-right candidate Buckley won the New York senate election even though more than 60% of the votes went for either of the two centre-left candidates. A less obvious but even more disturbing case is the recent Bush-Gore race. If those voting for Nader could have made Gore their second choice (which is a reasonable assumption), the democrats would have won without trouble, as the popular vote suggests.</p>
<p>But there are more complicated systems. The run-off method, for example, uses the 1,0,0 point rule in combination with several rounds of vote. Only a more than 50% support makes the winner. Otherwise the last candidate is dropped and the vote is repeated. An alternative is to exclude all but the first two candidates and vote a second time. This system, however, has its flaws too. The first version takes too long to be efficient in a national election, whereas the second can bring weird outcomes. In the 26 November 2000 election for the Romanian Presidency, this method led to a run-off between a left wing extremist and a right wing one. The centre vote had been split among several candidates.</p>
<p>The only simple and efficient method that in most cases expresses the will of the majority is the Borda count. Ranking the candidates and assigning a balanced rule of points, as in the 3,2,1 example, would make our elections fairer. We only need to implement this rule. Its time has arrived.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Baptist Convention uses a variant that I'm pretty sure is equivalent: the rankings are reversed (1=top choice) and the winner has the least total. (I've been looking for a name for this method for a couple of years, thanks =) 142.177.22.218 01:17, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A (1=top, 2=second)... point count, with least points for the winner is only equivalent to Borda if all candidates must be ranked. In contrast Borda counts can allow (or force) limitations to rankings, like top-three only. (Your ABC variant could also allow limited ranking if all unranked candidates are given a some maximum point score rather than zero)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The paragraphs above ARE certainly biased in evaluating Borda. Borda can reward strategic dishonest ranking. Borda is a simple and good method if you want to assume sincere voting and you don't care about simple majority rule. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomruen_a194.html" title="User:Tomruen">Tom Ruen</a> 01:33, Jun 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ANY voting method has the opportunities for strategic dishonest ranking. One simply needs to look at the mathematical analysis of the method to see this. Simple majority rule is accomplished only by running two candidates for a position. And even that is a special case of Borda count where n=2. There is no way to design a voting method that completely prevents dishonest voters from creating manipulative effects. Take a look at Arrow's Theorem for proof of that. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:40, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that what he is referring to is the fact that Borda is one of the few methods that fails the majority criterion, which is that the first choice of a majority should be elected. This is why he recommends Borda "if you don't care about simple majority rule", because there is the possibility that a simple majority will not get its choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Arrow's theorem is irrelevant to this discussion; it says that no voting method can satisfy a certain three properties, but there are many other properties to consider.</dd>

<p>The whole article reads like a POV apologetic: "Borda is wonderful, and it is has any minor flaws then every other system has them too." A better article would be "This is how Borda works, this is its biases (towards candidates who are lots of people's second choice but few first choice), these are its curiosities, here is where it is used." --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudiovideo_858d.html" title="User:Audiovideo">Audiovideo</a> 14:11, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Talk%7EBorda_count_397d.html" title="Edit section: Pro-Borda POV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pro-Borda POV</span></h2>
<p>The section on strategic voting was written with an extremely pro-Borda POV, making unfounded attacks on other voting systems, and unjustified declarations that Borda would solve all the world's problems.</p>
<p>The terminology used was taken from Donald Saari's very POV book, "Chaotic Elections", in which he constructs mathematical models specifically designed for analyzing positional election methods, concludes (correctly) that Borda is the fairest positional election method, but then he tries to apply this model to other ranked methods, and uses the fact that it doesn't fit to conclude that Borda is better than <i>any</i> other election method. He glosses over the strategic flaws in Borda, which are more obvious than the ones he attacks in Approval and Condorcet.</p>
<p>I suspect that the section was written either by a Saari supporter, or someone who has been taken in by his book without looking at the argument critically. I've tried to NPOV the section; let me know if I swung it too far the other way.</p>
<p>An interesting note: Saari and other Borda supporters tend to advocate Instant Borda Runoff when confronted with strategic flaws in Borda, but they claim, approximately, that Instant Borda Runoff is simply a "tallying method" on top of Borda that cleans it up in real-world situations, and allows its excellence to shine through. Yet Instant Borda Runoff turns out to be a Condorcet method, and Saari at least spends chapters on discrediting Condorcet. (My personal opinion is that IBR is indeed better than Borda, but if you're going to do Condorcet, you can do it much more easily than with a boatload of Borda counts.)</p>

<p>The statements I wrote about other voting systems in relation to Borda are true. Never did I state that Borda would solve all the world's problems as Rspeer falsely alleges. [Personal attack removed]. IBR is NOT a combination or irv and borda count. That is false information and I am removing that. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:04, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rspeer seems have the idea that comparing one voting system to another is bad, when it is entirely legitimate as they are in the same body of data. [Personal attack]. The comparison was restored. IBR is most definitely only a tallying method. [Personal attack]. All true statements have been restored. Rspeer strategic nomination points have been retained with correction of his grammar.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:44, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>[Personal attack], as instant borda runoff is just a term to describe a tallying procedure where the lowest scoring candidate is eliminated ALONG with his points, unlike irv which transfers them to another candidate. The tallying procedures are entirely different as ibr never transfers votes to another candidate. The purpose is to break asymmetric ties and ascertain the strongest candidate overall. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:56, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Summary of points:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBR has exactly the same relation to Borda as IRV has to Plurality.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a falsehood. IRV ranks candidates and transfers votes. Plurality neither ranks or transfers votes. IBR eliminates and retallies with no vote transference. It is strictly a tallying procedure as a straight tally can be done without ibr. There is no equation whatsoever.--71.98.149.61 22:42, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>I certainly don't think comparing methods is bad; in fact, I am trying to open up objective comparisons between Borda and other methods that the previous article shut out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes? You did not do that in your edit. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In one personal attack, you said that I resented the rigor of Saari's research. (Other observers of this debacle will have to look in the history for confirmation; I stand by the doctrine of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">removing personal attacks</a>.) I have no issue with the parts of "Chaotic Elections" that are rigorous; the part I take issue with is the <i>opinion</i>, and I do not resent it, I disagree with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exactly which opinions do you disagree with. You did not specify. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Talk%7EBorda_count_397d.html" title="Edit section: On Instant Borda Runoff">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">On Instant Borda Runoff</span></h3>
<p>First of all, I didn't even add the section on Instant Borda Runoff comparing it to IRV. Your original version said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Instant Borda Runoff, or IBR, as mentioned in a previous section, provides the advantages of the Borda count with the counter-manipulation features of an instant runoff tally.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Just because the words "instant" and "runoff" are used does not imply ibr is in any way related to irv, which is called in other countries, alternative vote, Hare method, etc. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally, I shouldn't even have to defend this point if I were really anti-Borda. Instant Borda Runoff is a fairly good voting method based on Borda, and if my purpose were to attack Borda, I could do so more easily without pointing out that many of the problems are fixed by IBR.</p>
<p>IBR is Not a voting method, it is a tallying method that uses a Borda count ballot. Tallying and ballots are two different bodies of data. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But IBR, as I understand it, does exactly the same thing with Borda that IRV does with plurality. In the IBR that I know of, the candidate with the fewest points is dropped - along with his points, yes - and then the points for other candidates are recalculated based on ballots that are missing that candidate and where the points go up to n-1 instead of n. Since the distribution of points changes, I don't see why you wouldn't call this a "transfer", though it is indeed more subtle than IRV's transfer. (And if the distribution of points didn't change, then there would be no point to the runoff.)</p>
<p>Not true. In plurality voting, you get one choice. In irv, you rank candidates, where the rankings are considered seperate ballots. The initial tally eliminates the candidate with the least number of votes and transfers them proportionally to the remaining candidates. The instant runoff is an integral part of irv. Borda count can exist completely independent of ibr. Again, ibr is a tallying method and nothing more than a tallying method.--71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The same method describes IRV when you take "points" to mean the number of first-place votes. Candidates are dropped along with their points, and then you recalculate the points based on ballots without that candidate.</p>
<p>No. In irv, votes are transfered. Votes are never transfered in Borda count or when using the ibr talling procedure. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not a point I am adamant about, but I feel that the clearest and most correct way to describe IBR is a combination of IRV and Borda, since (as your article stated) it combines features of both.</p>
<p>No it does not. IBR is strictly a tallying procedure. Call it successive Baldwin elimination if you will. Forget the instant and runoff words if it helps. But it is still only an alternate tallying procedure for the Borda count. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now, I may have misunderstood what you mean by Instant Borda Runoff - the section that describes it in terms of Baldwin elimination is not especially clear. However, this is what most people mean by Instant Borda Runoff, including Saari.</p>
<p>Yes. We agree.--71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Talk%7EBorda_count_397d.html" title="Edit section: Responses to responses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Responses to responses</span></h4>
<p>It would be far easier to tell what point you were making if you formed a response as a coherent whole, instead of interspersing your sentences with mine. I get the feeling that you are generally quibbling over semantics in my response to you, instead of supporting your own argument.</p>
<p>I have asked below for you to explain what the difference is between a "tallying procedure" and an "election method", because I have never heard a "tallying procedure" used to describe something that can change the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>"Successive Baldwin elimination" is a term that should be eliminated completely from the article, due to its obscurity. The mechanism should be described, not just named.</p>
<p>The distinction you are drawing between IRV and IBR seems to be ideological, rather than mathematical. If you envision the changes in scores that occur in IRV as "transfers of votes", that's okay, but that visual model is not part of the method. I also can't tell why you are so adamant on divorcing Instant Borda Runoff from Instant Runoff Voting; you are getting hung up on implementation details while the "instant runoff" mechanism remains the same. It's even in the title of each.</p>
<p>IRV and IBR and two different methods entirely.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 01:24, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will generalize both by describing "Instant Positional Runoff", which works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a way to assign scores positionally to votes. This way might be plurality (first place gets 1, all other places get 0), or it might be Borda (first place gets n-1, second place gets n-2, etc, last place gets 0).</li>
<li>Add up the positional scores.</li>
<li>Drop the candidate with the lowest score from all the ballots</li>
<li>If one candidate remains, that candidate wins.</li>
<li>Otherwise, re-assign the scores, based on the new ballots, and repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>O.K. You have legitimatized it by rigorous definition.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 01:25, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you plug in Plurality as the positional method to Instant Positional Runoff, you get IRV. If you plug in Borda, you get IBR, as described by Saari on page 103 of "Chaotic Elections".</p>

<p>I believe that the state of the election method articles on Wikipedia does not include <i>enough</i> comparison between methods. Often, methods are discussed entirely within their own framework, without giving the mathematical criteria necessary to compare methods. This is true of other articles besides the Borda Count one.</p>
<p>I am with you 100% on that point.--71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>However, I do not consider a valid comparison to be "method A is less manipulable than method B" or "method A is fairer than method B", because those are subjective, and in fact they shut out objective comparisons. A valid comparision is "method A satisfies the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotonicity_criterion.html" title="Monotonicity criterion">monotonicity criterion</a> while method B does not." Of course there is subjectivity in defining criteria, as it is easy to find criteria that one's favorite voting method satisfies and others don't; the best you can do is go with criteria that supporters of different voting methods agree on, and to describe in what voting situations those criteria are useful.</p>
<p>We agree again.--71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your current edit shuts out objective comparison with its first sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Borda count does not encourage tactical voting to the degree that plurality voting, approval voting or instant-runoff voting does.</i></dd>

<p>because it is not possible to define a measurable "degree" of tactical voting. There are simply different tactics that each method is susceptible to.</p>
<p>Not true. Actually it is possible to measure degrees of tactical vulnerability by enumerating paradoxical opportunities in the method. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only valid way to compare voting methods is with well-defined criteria. Use these criteria (Category: Voting method criteria) to show in which areas your voting method does better. Without criteria, you are left with nothing but competing ideologies.</p>
<p>I assume that "enumerating paradoxical opportunities" is something you do within Saari's positional models; he certainly likes the word "paradox". If that's the case, then it is only applicable for comparing positional methods, which is not useful because there are no other ranked positional methods on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If you mean you want to count the number of situations where a voter, given certain information, can get an advantage by voting dishonestly: that doesn't work. You can't just enumerate them, because some situations are more likely than others, and you don't know what information voters will have. Determining the likelihood of strategic voting is a <i>really hard</i> problem, and it depends entirely on your model of how people vote. Supporters of different voting methods have come up with different models that each support their favorite method, just like Saari's model supports Borda.</p>

<p>I am certain that Donald Saari has done some impressive and rigorous things in his career, and indeed he begins "Chaotic Elections" with some mathematically rigorous definitions, but the point he wants readers to take away from the book - that Borda is the best voting method - is not rigorous because it is an <i>opinion</i>, and I disagree with the reasoning he uses to convince his readers of that opinion, which generally involves taking mathematical models he defined for positional methods, and then applying them to non-positional methods in ways that he hopes will give unflattering results.</p>
<p>I would not presume Don Saari has ulterior motives for his endorsement of the Borda count. You are assuming that he is attempting to propagandize Borda count and there is not evidence to prove any such thing. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For example, I will paraphrase his treatment of Approval voting like this: "The ballots cast in an approval election could come from voter preferences spanning all these segments of my positional-ranking triangle diagram" (fact). "Isn't that <i>horrible</i>?" (opinion).</p>
<p>True, but it is clear what the fact is and what the opinion is. --71.98.149.61 21:19, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know what Saari's motive is - I'd guess it's that he spent a lot of time making a model of positional methods, so he wants positional methods to be relevant.</p>
<p>To put it another way, he wants to educate the public about ranked methods, which is a noble goal. However, the only machinery he has to do so is his positional model, so the only method he can advocate with the backing of his mathematics is the Borda Count.</p>
<p>I will emphasize again that what I take issue with is his criticisms of other methods, including Approval and Condorcet, using a model that does not apply to them. He does this in such a way that the reader is likely to come out convinced that he is absolutely right. I was temporarily convinced after reading the book, at which point my math advisor (who gave me the book, wanting me to look at it critically, and got me interested in studying voting methods) had to talk me back to the real world, making similar arguments to the ones I am making now.</p>
<p>Saari criticizes Approval, essentially, by saying that a certain Approval result could correspond to any of a number of different Borda results. If you put this the other way, a certain Borda result could correspond to any of a number of different Approval results. This is not illustrating a flaw in either; it is illustrating that they are thoroughly unrelated methods.</p>
<p>He criticizes Condorcet by <i>rearranging</i> the preferences on Condorcet ballots until he has some imaginary "cyclical ballots", which do not correspond to the wishes of any voter. He also forces his model on Condorcet and calls the resulting mess "Condorcet noise". (You could just as well analyze Borda with a Condorcet graph, and call it "positional noise" interfering with the result of Condorcet.)</p>
<p>Finally, to show that either he's not really convinced of his criticism of Condorcet, or he didn't think it through fully, he proposes Instant Borda Runoff, which happens to always choose the Condorcet winner when one exists.</p>

<p>This page will need to have the pro-Borda POV removed, and be put into a form that is as neutral as possible while enabling comparisons to other voting methods. It should do this by following the outline of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Voting_Systems_a401.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Voting Systems">Wikipedia:WikiProject Voting Systems</a>, which this page deviates from in the later sections.

<p>The information on the page is rather jumbled; for example, technical details like Baldwin elimination are described high up on the page. In places, Baldwin elimination is suggested as a tie-breaking technique; most voting method pages do not go into such detail on tie-breakers.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Unlike approval voting, all candidates are ranked on their merits, and in contentious elections, does not tactically revert to plurality voting.</i></dd>

<p>In the paragraph where I describe the teaming effect:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>then adding more of these candidates to the ballot increases the odds of one of this group winning. That is, the method is not cloneproof, a characteristic which it shares with almost all other voting methods.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Changing "each" to "one of this group" was correct. Sorry about my sloppy wording. However, you should explain which voting methods you are considering when you say that vulnerability to clones is "a characteristic which it shares with almost all other voting methods." The most widely-used voting methods (plurality, two-round runoffs, and maybe IRV) are indeed vulnerable in the opposite direction, having the spoiler effect. Approval and well-designed Condorcet methods, however, are cloneproof.</p>
<p>The only Condorcet type method I know of that is cloneproof is Schwartz Cloneproof Sequential Elimination. Approval voting is Not cloneproof. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 21:38, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>It should be noted that any paradoxes which can be found in the Borda count are also present in all other positional methods, and usually in greater number.</i></dd>

<p>This is misleading. It makes it sound like Borda triumphs over a large number of other voting methods, because you're glossing over the fact that only two positional methods are seriously proposed: Plurality and Borda. And Plurality doesn't have ranking paradoxes, because people don't actually vote on ranked ballots in plurality elections.</p>
<p>There are other positional methods like vote for two, vote for three. The winner of a plurality election is the result of plurality ranking paradoxes. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 21:38, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Finally, I do not understand the distinction you are maintaining between an "election method" and a "tallying procedure". To me, a "tallying procedure" is like whether you calculate Single Transferrable Vote by writing down numbers on paper, putting rankings into a computer, or moving ballots between bins; that is, they are different mechanical ways to compute the same result. Instant Borda Runoff, however, gives different results than plain Borda, so I would say it is a different election method, not a tallying procedure.</p>
<p>Not true. IBR will likely produce the same winner as a straight Borda tally, unless there are some significant condorcet components in the tally. An election method is all of the procedures used to determine a winner or winners in an election, the tallying procedure being only one part of the overall method. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 21:38, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Vote for two" and "vote for three" are not seriously proposed by election reformers, so they are easy straw men to shoot down.

<p>Approval is cloneproof. Voters vote the same way on all clone candidates (if a significant number of voters approved of one and disapproved of another, they wouldn't be clone candidates), so clones get the same number of total votes. The team of clones wins if and only if one of them would have won independently.</p>

<p>"Likely" is not the same as "always". In fact, most election methods are "likely" to give the same result in the same situation, but they do not always do so, and that is why they are different methods. This is also why IBR is a different method from Borda, just like IRV is different from Plurality, and one Condorcet method is different from another. In fact, even Cloneproof SSD is considered a different method from SSD, even though they only differ in the tie-breaking procedure.</p>
<p>I am beginning to suspect that you are using your nonstandard "tallying procedure" terminology to obstruct revision to this article. You still haven't defined what the distinction is, and why you need to make that distinction. Why is it so important to you that IBR is described as a "tallying procedure" instead of an "election method"?</p>
<p>One could define a different tallying procedure linked to a standard balloting procedure as a similar election method.

<p>Regardless of whether it is "obvious" that it can be used to break ties, it is not obvious that it <i>should</i>. As far as I can tell, you are the only person who is proposing this kind of tie-breaker. Therefore it does not belong on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Most election method pages don't mention tie-breakers, unless it is crucial to a property of the method (like <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schulze_method.html" title="Schulze method">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>, where the "cloneproof" part comes from the tie-breaker). This is because you don't <i>need</i> complicated rules for a tie-breaker.

<p>You have not provided an explanation for why you think IRV transfers votes and IBR doesn't, and even if that were true why it would be relevant. That claim sounds a lot like claims made by the IRV supporters, who use ill-defined catch-phrases like "one person, one vote" and "don't divide your forces" and say that only IRV satisfies them. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 03:49, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>IRV is based on the single transferable vote, where votes from a candidate eliminated after a round are transfered and distributed to the remaining candidates. IBR eliminates the candidate and the votes. They are not transfered and distributed to other candidates. It is relevant because ibr and irv and two entirely different procedures. I am surprised that you ask this. Your comparison of my statements to false irv public relations lines is baseless.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:26, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me deliberately caricature this argument. Remove it as a personal attack if you will, but I am trying to make a point to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You add a statement to the article saying "The Borda count is not emfoozable."</li>
<li>I say, "What does that mean?"</li>
<li>You say, "That means that it cannot be emfoozled, obviously."</li>
<li>I say, "Even if that meant something, why should it go in the article?"</li>
<li>You respond as if I had argued that the Borda count is <i>not</i> emfoozable, with a heated response affirming that <i>of course</i> it is emfoozable, and ignoring my question of <b>why this belongs in the article</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may believe there's something inherently wrong about "transfers" and therefore frame IBR to deny that it's doing "transfers", but that's all meaningless. There are no "transfers" in IBR or IRV, there are only numbers and lists of candidates that change from one round to another. You have not explained why this distinction needs to be made, and why anyone should care.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 17:53, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are transfers of votes upon elimination in IRV. That is a verifiable fact. There are no transfers of votes in IBR upon elimination and that is a verifiable fact. This distinction needs to be made because they are two different bodies of data. Sensible people do care about differences and care about facts. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 18:10, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>These are not facts, (removed personal attack) (this was an attack on your argument, not you. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a>), until you define what you mean by "transfer", preferrably with a mathematical basis. Any consistent definition of "transfer" I can think of encompasses both IRV and IBR.</p>
<p>I can see why IRV <i>looks</i> more like "transfers", in a fuzzy and ill-defined way. The points in IRV can be imagined as discrete entities that move from one candidate to another, while in each round of IBR, <i>all</i> the scores change and you can't trace the changes back to the candidate that was eliminated. Is this what you're doing? Why do you believe this is a valid way of comparing voting systems?</p>
<p>This sentence makes no sense: <i>This distinction needs to be made because they are two different bodies of data.</i> Clearly the distinction does not need to be made, because so many thorough descriptions of the Borda count don't feel the need to make it, and I'd be surprised if you showed me one that does. (Please, one that <i>actually</i> does, not one that talks about a vaguely similar thing.)</p>

<p>You need to clear up the word "transfer" in a good dictionary. For you and I to communicate well, we need to have the same definitions of words.

<p>I'm not hiding my full name, but I prefer to go by RSpeer in Wikipedia discussions, so I'm changing your heading.</p>
<p>There are too many pro-Borda links here, especially given the lack of opposing links. You will not find that many positive links on any other voting system article. So I picked a few to delete. The deBorda one was probably the wrong one. I apologize for editing rashly - I'm not going to defend that particular edit.</p>
<p>I don't want an edit war with you. It was nice to temporarily be on the same side as you about Hermitage's links, but you started going too far, making edits that served no purpose except to attack or thwart Hermitage. I was also trying to show that my goals for the voting systems pages don't just apply to new users: Hermitage complained that the external links for Borda are excessively slanted, and he was right, so I started doing something about it. The only thing that makes this an "edit war" with you is that the links were added by you, and you are protective of them. - RSpeer</p>
<p>I am not against you. I am glad to see that there are other folks who care about voting methods and selecting the methods that are appropriate to the needs of a circumstance. If you want to do that as part of your career, I wish you great success in that. It is a skill that is badly needed. I hope you understand that. The links I have posted are published peer-reviewed articles. Yes, most of them present favorable conclusions about the BC, but some of them prove that the BC has vulnerabilities. The voting systems page links usually go to websites that have general information or research articles on voting systems in general. We need to impose standards for links which I think should be advocacy organizations for a particular method and primary, published and peer-reviewed research on the method or comparing the method to others. Otherwise, we open the door to anyone putting up a stupid pro or con vanity site into the links and just adding clutter to the article. I am as protective of this article as you are of what you edit, but like you, I am willing and grateful for others to responsibly edit. They usually do a good job. Usually. You are perhaps aware that theoretical vulnerabilities are not the same as what occurs in practice. The BC is used in real elections and I have not found complaints from any parties involved with them. Hermitage's concluding comment in his BC article, which is not pub'd and peer-rv'd, contradicts actual experience with this method. It is simply shoddy scholarship. I have respect and regard for the academic process. Occasionally it censors a radical innovation, but more often it weeds out slipshod scholarship and overt bias. I welcome any con BC articles that are published and peer-reviewed to be added to the links.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 13:42, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I may seem inconsistent to you in who I side with. This is because I'm not siding with editors, but with edits. The edits that you make to all other articles besides Borda count are reasonable and helpful, and I commend you for spending so much time on the project.

<dd><i>The latter criteria should receive some commentary: No clone candidates have ever been or are likely to be identified, so the ICC non-compliance should be viewed only from a theoretical perspective for actual candidates.

<p>A source is needed for the notion that "no clone candidates ... are likely to be identified." Since Borda rewards nominations of similar candidates, it doesn't even seem relevant whether clones can be "identified" after the fact.</p>

<dd>ICC is not a "theory," and it's not limited to Tideman. This article even has a link to an article on clone manipulability. If you don't like that article, then also Woodall discusses it in "Properties of Election Rules," Voting Matters Issue 3, Dec 1994.

<p>For a voting theory to be relevant, it must reflect reality, or even predict heretofore unobserved phenomena which can be confirmed. ICC does neither on the subject of candidates.

<dd>Ok, so I guess you really do just criticize the use of the term <i>clone</i>. (You don't deny that the idea is useful; you suggest here that it's so obvious it doesn't need to be mentioned.) Unfortunately this term "clone" has caught on; outside of the EM mailing list, I don't know of any term used besides "clone." <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKVenzke_37cc.html" title="User:KVenzke">KVenzke</a> 15:25, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be <b>Independence of correlated pairs</b>. In real life those correlated pairs may be identical or very similar alternatives, and properly they would be proposals or objects. Extending that criterion to people is quite a stretch. This sums up my objections to the term and its use. Hope this clears things up.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:34, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So all of this was because you thought the term "clones" referred to people? Then it is just a misunderstanding. Clones can be any sort of options, and in voting theory you don't care whether the options are people, proposals, or flavors of ice cream.</p>
<p>The term "candidate" is often used to mean any kind of option that can be voted for, which is perhaps awkward terminology, but it shouldn't be taken to mean that a statement about "candidates" applies only to people. The terminology doesn't distinguish whether the candidates are people or not, because there's no reason to. The algorithm still works the same way.</p>
<p>So "clones" are pretty much the same as what you mean when you say "correlated pairs". But "correlated pairs" is not standard terminology, and in fact it's not general enough, because they don't just have to come in pairs. You could have a set of 3 or 5 or 100 clones. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 20:20, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Taken down to the minimum unit it would be pairs, which are subsets of a correlated set. The smallest non-empty set would contain two elements. O.K. so it should properly be called independence of correlated elements. This clones stuff is very misleading and is a poor choice of noun.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 21:10, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>However, some methods would satisfy "Independence of Pairs (as in two candidates)" but do not satisfy "Independence of Clones (as in any number of candidates)." For example, MinMax methods can misbehave when you replace a single candidate with three candidates, all in a cycle. But it can't misbehave when you just replace one candidate at a time with two candidates. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKVenzke_37cc.html" title="User:KVenzke">KVenzke</a> 05:11, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hermitage reverted an edit I made by removing the Smith Criteria from the Borda count article. Several points here: There is no consensus on which criteria to evaluate a method by. The evaluation of methods with criteria is arbitrary and inconsistent. As Borda is not a Condorcet method, it would never be Smith compliant, thus stating it fails Smith is redundant and unnecessary. Therefore, <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">User:Hermitage</a>'s revert was unjustified.

<p>I agree with removing Smith, since the failure is implied by failing Condorcet. I also agree with removing IIA, since virtually every method fails that. I don't know why you say, in the summary, that IIA is only for Condorcet methods.

<p>Discussion of tactical voting is important to an understanding of the Borda method. For example, Dennis Mueller (who has many favorable things to say about Borda) writes <i>"The Borda count's Achilles' heel is commonly felt to be its vulnerability to strategic behavior (Pattanaik 1974; M. Sen, 1984)."</i> Opinions may differ on the severity of Borda's vulnerability, but certainly the issue should be represented significantly within the article.</p>
<p>F451 advocates the Borda count, and such is obviously his right, but his pro-Borda opinions should not cause him to edit the tactical voting section down to a tiny stub.</p>
<p>The following sentence was written by RSpeer on 23:10, 8 April 2005:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Voters in a Borda count election can usually see the potential for voting strategically: if there are only two candidates with a reasonable chance of winning, they will want to rank the candidate of those two they prefer first, and the other candidate last, to maximize the difference in points they contribute to the total.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>F451 removed it on 00:39, 7 June 2005, with the summary "removed POV paragraph". On 08:32, 12 July 2005, I modestly expanded the tactical voting section, and included a re-worded version of RSpeer's example, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>For example, if there are two candidates whom a voter considers to be the most likely to win, the voter can maximize the power of his or her vote by ranking the more-preferred of the two candidates in first place, and ranking the less-preferred of the two candidates in last place, thus potentially employing both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many voters employ such strategies, then the result will no longer reflect the sincere preferences of the electorate.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>F451 considers this to be "POV". I disagree. First of all, it is factually correct. Second of all, it illustrates a relevant aspect of the Borda method. In my opinion, the tactical voting section of this article should be further expanded at some point, but I think that the current version is good considering its brevity. If F451 can come up with a factually correct statement that he feels gives more 'balance' to the section, I will welcome it. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">Hermitage</a> 07:09, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. I don't like RSpeer's "can usually" phrasing, but otherwise it's not bad. I don't find Hermitage's wording to be as clear, with wording like "maximize the power." It should say something to the effect of (or at least, implying): When there are two front-runners (say <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>), and some weak candidates (say <i>C</i>) that no one likes, the voters have a dilemma. Suppose my sincere preference order is A&gt;B&gt;C. I can best help A defeat B by voting A&gt;C&gt;B instead. But if other voters do the same thing, then C will win, which no one wants. But on the other hand if I vote sincerely as A&gt;B&gt;C, I could very well be handing the election to B when A could have won. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKVenzke_37cc.html" title="User:KVenzke">KVenzke</a> 14:57, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about this:

<dd><i>For example, if there are two candidates whom a voter considers to be the most likely to win, the voter can maximize their impact on the contest between these candidates by ranking the candidate whom they like more in first place, and ranking the candidate whom they like less in last place.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>for the re-phrasing of the initial idea? I got rid of the "maximize the power" phrase.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However we phrase that part, I still like the other supporting/expanding ideas that I added:
<dl>
<dd><i>If neither candidate is their sincere first or last choice, the voter is employing both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many voters employ such strategies, then the result will no longer reflect the sincere preferences of the electorate.</i></dd>

<p>Over the course of a month or so, a group of voting methods-interested wikipedia editors (including F541) tried to reach a consensus on which criteria to consistently include in voting methods articles, on the following page: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Talk%7EVoting_system_Included_methods_and_criteria_cd6e.html" title="Talk:Voting system/Included methods and criteria">Talk:Voting system/Included methods and criteria</a>. A majority of participating editors agreed that summability should not be one of these criteria, on the grounds that it is only failed by one method on wikipedia (<a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_runoff_voting.html" title="Instant runoff voting">instant runoff voting</a>), and that it would be excessive to list it on all other method pages. (In the same way that it would be excessive to list the Pareto criterion on all method pages, when nearly every voting method (<a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_voting.html" title="Approval voting">approval voting</a> is the exception that I'm aware of) passes it.)</p>
<p>Recently, F451 re-added the summability criterion to this page on the grounds that it is listed on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schulze_method.html" title="Schulze method">Schulze method</a> page. My counter-argument was that the criteria listed on the Schulze method page goes far beyond the standard criteria list, making that page something of an exception to the rule. My reasoning is that if the Schulze method page is used as a justification for adding the summability criterion to this page, then by the same token a whole slew of other criteria should be added as well, such as mutual majority, pareto, local IIA, Woodall's plurality, minimal defense, reversal symmetry, invulnerability to burying, etc. (There are 30 criteria currently listed on the Schulze method page.)</p>
<p>So, I think that the summability criterion should not be included in this page unless anyone can offer a better justification. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">Hermitage</a> 05:24, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

It might be nice to gain greater consistency. I would be open to adding more criteria from the Schulze page to the other method pages (for example: mutualy majority, Pareto, Smith, Schwartz, Woodall's plurality, and invulnerabilty to burying), and I would also be open to deleting criteria from the Schulze page (for example: strategy free criterion, generalized strategy free criterion, strong and weak defensive strategy criteria, minimal defense, favorite betrayal criterion, summability). Note that there is no extreme pro-Condorcet slant here, as many of the Mike Ossipoff criteria that I am willing to delete were designed specifically to support WV Condorcet.</dd>

<dd><i>Another way, called the modified Borda count, is to assign the points up to k-1, where k is the number of candidates ranked on a ballot.

<p>It's true, that this doesn't satisfy Plurality. Incidentally, this isn't the variation I had in mind when I edited <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality_criterion.html" title="Plurality criterion">Plurality criterion</a>, though. I'll give an example to illustrate:</p>
<p>51 A<br />
50 B&gt;C</p>

<p>Using the quoted method, A receives 51 points, B receives 100, and C receives 50.</p>
<p>The method I had in mind was to give A 102 points, but then B and C would split the 51 points that could have gone to one of them. Then B receives 100+25.5 points, and C receives 50+25.5. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKVenzke_37cc.html" title="User:KVenzke">KVenzke</a> 20:48, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my opinion, this (as well as strictly-ranked Borda) violates the "spirit" of the Plurality criterion, since a voter might be compelled to rank randomly when he would prefer to just truncate.

<p>I'm sorry, F451, but your edit to replace the strategic voting problem in Borda with a link is seriously poor style.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you are sorry about anything. I think it is proper editing. Please show me the wikipedia policy against it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Wiki articles don't say things like "For more information, see:" in the text. The reader knows that clicking on a link gives more information.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>O.K. Then why not just remove that phrase?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There is no rule against duplicating information; in fact, it's quite common to include information from another page when it's relevant to the topic. This is much nicer to the reader than sticking the information behind a link, which requires effort (and, currently, about a minute of waiting time on average) to load. An example of this is that numerous articles about voting give brief statements of <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem.html" title="Arrow's impossibility theorem">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a>, rather than just mentioning it and making the reader click a link to find out what it means.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The latency time for me is about 10 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I don't understand what your motivation is for removing this section, unless it's to hide a common criticism of Borda from the reader. Can you give me an explanation? It's getting harder to assume good faith.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Your motivation is clearly that you hate Borda count. I moved the paragraph because you stated the explanation in the tactical voting article was in the abstract. It is long passed the point where I assume good faith from you.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 20:46, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
And you clearly love the Borda count (or at least as much as I "hate" it), but I thought we put aside this difference long ago and started working on generally improving the voting system articles. I'm disappointed that we have to start fighting again.</p>
<p>You've dodged the most important question: why should the reader have to click through a link at all to read pertinent information about the Borda count? It's not POV to describe a common criticism of something, and in fact including relevant criticisms is an important component of NPOV.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I replied that the latency time for me is about 10 seconds. There is no burden clicking the mouse once.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a somewhat tangential issue, the current state of that section is very clunky just in writing style. I'd fix it, but you probably wouldn't like my version.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably not. You predicted accurately.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd just like to put the mention of the particular voting strategy back. We can even still describe how the strategic problem is mitigated by truncated ballots, which is something I didn't know before (but don't you mean uniformly truncated and not voter-truncated?) Right now, though, it's not even clear what vulnerability truncated ballots are reducing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Strategic manipulation. Uniform truncation definitely makes it more difficult to manipulate, but so does voter truncation possibly to a lesser extent. In both cases, information is denied to the manipulators to predict with accuracy the ballot profiles. That is based on Conitzer's and Sandholm's research.</dd>
</dl>
<p>No matter what else you want to respond to, I'd like you to respond to this: how does removing the description of this particular voting strategy improve the article?</p>
<p>Because it is put into the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_voting.html" title="Tactical voting">tactical voting</a> article where lengthy descriptions belong.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:50, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course it doesn't. There's nothing wrong with the section as written before. F451, try to fix an article or a section that is actually bad, rather than lowering the quality of a section that is pretty good. If you have some correct and useful infomation, go ahead and add it. Otherwise, you're just wasting your own time and the time of others. You must have something better to do, eh? If you like Borda so much, go ahead and form a Borda advocacy group. Pass out fliers, harangue your local politicians... whatever. There are better venues for your Borda-love than making poorly-thought-out changes to the wikipedia. If you think that people revert your edits because you're some kind of noble minority of one standing up against groupthink, that's just goofy self-aggrandisement, and you should get over yourself. People revert your edits because they're not well thought out. They are often innacurate, misleading, or vague, and they sometimes delete content that is accurate and meaningful. Of course you have a few good contributions to make to the discussion, but your edits go well beyond that point. Anyway, that's my opinion.

<dd>It always is your opinion and you are welcome I have read it. I am a wikipedia editor and I shall edit. And incidentally, you are badly mistaken about truncation making elections easier to manipulate. In general, it makes them more difficult.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 17:50, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Give some evidence that <i>voter</i> truncation can do something to prevent manipulation. I can't see how that would be possible, as it gives each voter more strategic options. Also, give an actual reason to remove this section from <i>this</i> article. Leave <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_voting.html" title="Tactical voting">tactical voting</a>, which is a different article, out of it. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 04:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The voter is not forced to rank or rate choices that are unacceptable. This does not eliminate, but reduces opportunities and incentives for insincere ranking. Manipulation opportunities by strategic nomination are also reduced as there is now truncation information that needs to be collected to predict an outcome and this adds additional uncertainty into a forecast. I think this is obvious. Conitzer and Sandholm showed this with a prescribed truncation, but the general principle holds for an arbitrary truncation. I have to ask you why it would not if you still disagree.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 21:39, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Say my preferences are A&gt;B&gt;C. If I think that B is a closer competitor to A, I have an incentive to vote A (if truncation is allowed) or A&gt;C&gt;B (if it isn't). The former strategy is less risky, in that it does not help C's score get any closer to A's. For example, I wrote earlier that a coordinated majority can impose their will on the result in Borda count. If truncation is allowed, this is extremely easy: all they have to do is rank their preferred candidate in first place and truncate against all candidates whom they like less. If truncation is not allowed, the majority has to have some knowledge of what the other voters will do. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">Hermitage</a> 22:57, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What you state is correct in a limited context: It also depends on if the voter approves or disapproves of B and/or C if they would rank them.</dd>
<dd>It could be that A is the only acceptable choice to the voter and bullet voting A is sincere. A majority would need to be borg-like and perfectly coordinate a mass bullet vote to do what you propose. By the extension of your proposition, a majority could impose a ranking profile that is strategically contrived based on information about minority profiles. Yes, it is possible, but more likely, some majority subset coalitions of voters will choose second or third preferences. To manipulate such an election, one also needs to know which voters will truncate and to what extent, and which will not. I think you can see that more information would have to be collected and more uncertainty is added to the forecast. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 23:39, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see the logic to this argument. More information needs to be collected? If you want to perform strategy based on how others are voting, the information you want is what ballots they will cast. Why would it be harder to gather such information if ballots were truncated?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, my point holds: truncation strategies in truncation-allowed Borda tend on balance to be less risky and easier to coordinate and less risky than order reversal strategies if truncation is not allowed. Not that I am advocating Borda w/o truncation -- the main point is that allowing truncation doesn't magically get rid of Borda's high manipulability. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">Hermitage</a></dd>

<dd>Hmm. This is becoming an interesting discussion. If borda can be voter truncated from the low rankings, that is, the highest ranking candidate would get the normal borda count point value and so on down the rankings, as opposed to modified borda count that is truncated from the high rankings, then would not such a borda variant satisfy the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_criterion.html" title="Majority criterion">majority criterion</a>? And if equal rankings were allowed, would it not also satisfy the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_majority_criterion.html" title="Mutual majority criterion">mutual majority criterion</a>?</dd>

<dd>Truncation allowed or not, Borda fails MC and MMC. All you need to do to show that a method fails a criterion is to provide one failure example. If I provide an example without truncation in which Borda fails MC, and full rankings are at least allowed (if not mandatory), Borda fails MC in general.

<p>What I am proposing is that when voter truncation from the bottom is allowed, this variant is not the same as standard BC. If equal ranking is allowed, that would be a different variant again. Do you see where I am going with this?--209.4.43.58 01:52, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand borda does not comply with mc or mmc, but my point is that when you change the rules, different criteria can and cannot be satisfied.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 14:18, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, but a feature of the way MC is defined is if a method without truncation fails it, that method with truncation has to fail it too, because the same situation that makes it fail without truncation could appear in a situation where none of the voters happen to choose to truncate. Correct me if I'm misunderstanding the issue.</p>

<p>You are misunderstanding the issue. I was using mc and mmc just as a hypothetical example. What you state is correct, but my point was that changing balloting and tabulation rules can give rise to new criteria satisfaction and destroy others. Nothing more to it than that.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 01:05, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A thought about a comment you made way above: <i>"It is long passed the point where I assume good faith from you."</i></p>
<p>I'm not sure you understand the significance of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>. It's part of being a Wikipedia editor, not something you can choose whether or not to do. For instance, since I know that you are not actually a vandal, and that your goal is to improve Wikipedia, I assume that your edits are constructive until I can pass further judgment. (And in most cases, they are.) I am not a vandal either, and my goal is to improve Wikipedia as well, so you likewise need to assume by default that my edits are constructive.</p>
<p>The issue here is that, on this article, we disagree on what would improve Wikipedia; if I can hazard a guess, I'd say that you think it would improve Wikipedia to have a more flattering picture of the Borda count. Clearly we disagree here; I think that Wikipedia's picture of the Borda count should include both its praise <i>and</i> its criticism by voting theorists, whenever it is significant, in a way that is accessible to the reader so the reader can make his own judgment.</p>
<p>So, as I said before, it's hard to assume good faith in a conflict like this. But it's necessary. And it's an interesting mental exercise to be civil to someone who you've never met and who you disagree with.</p>

<p>I'm not a student of voting systems, but I was reading the article and it seemed that there's another viable method for handling truncation. Specifically, the method would be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Any ranked candidates are given the normal number of points, and all unranked candidates are given the average number of points of the positions that were left unfilled. For example, if there are 10 candidates and a voter votes for candidate A first, candidate B second, and leaves all others unranked, then A would get 9 points, B would get 8 points, and all other candidates would get 3.5 points.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there any history of this method being talked about or used? It appears that it would satisfy the Plurality criterion but not the Non-compulsory support criterion. - <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooey_27ae.html" title="User:Flooey">Flooey</a> 07:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
