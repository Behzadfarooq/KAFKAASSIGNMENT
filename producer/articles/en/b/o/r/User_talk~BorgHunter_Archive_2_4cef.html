<p>Hi BorgHunter, As you can see, I'm telling baseball fans on Wikipedia about the baseball Wikicity you started. I certainly hope you'll start contributing to it again! Also, I see from your user page that you also live in St. Petersburg! You should come to the Wikipedia meetup that will be at the Panera Bread on 4th St. N. on January 14th. I'm not sure what time it will start yet, but if you're interested in coming, be sure to let me know and I'll tell you what time it starts once I know. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> will be there, along with many other long time Wikipedians, so a good time should be had by all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding NeoWin</span></h2>
<p>Hinotori has left a comment regarding it on the talk page; it's worth a look. My opinion is thus: Anons and new user sockpuppets were attacking the page and erasing NoneLoud, Hinotori and other people's contribs... so, given that, instead of full protection, why not instead try putting NeoWin into Semi-Protection? It would allow reg users to edit the page, while keeping out sockpuppets. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 23:30, 7 January 2006 (UTC) (Doom127)</p>

<dd>If I were involved in the editing, I'd get rid of the "list of admins and mods" too, myself. That doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Oh, and I don't deal with accusations of sockpuppeting and evading blocks; that's not my speciality. It's too complicated, and you need to get a checkuser from one who has those privileges to be absolutely sure.

He has not done so in the alloted time, nor has he ever done so in all of the time he has been blanking and reverting the page. The Neowin article is far from finished, but the more recent article that was produced by the community had far more structure and far less POV to it than the one that it keeps being reverted to. The edits by the anonymous editors that seem to originate from Brazil4linux (and Microsoft Fanboy) have done nothing but set the article back by removing hard work that everyone but him thinks is appropriate for the subject. The problem is that new IP addresses will just continue to blank or revert the article recklessly. That is why I am asking you personally to please put the article under semi-protection for the time being until the user gets bored with vandalizing the article. That way others can continue to develop the article and fix things (such as the listing of administrators) while users who want to vandalize the article can be kept under check.</dd>

<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>What can I say: you got me?&#160;:) That was <i>extremely</i> observant on your part, and I am impressed. Truth is, if I had noticed Izehar's short tenure at the time of the RfA, I very well might have passed it over as one I could neither support nor oppose -- I just missed that detail. Still, I admire your recall! Amazed, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:54, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's less amazing than merely observant. I noticed Izehar's RfA in the comments section and skimmed through all the supports, and just happened to notice your name there. For what it's worth, I don't want you to change your vote or anything, I was just pointing out an interesting anomaly. I replied to BD2412's Neutral vote the same way. In any case, based on some advice I've received, I am going to cease replying to oppose votes on the RfA, even though I'm an opinionated bastard with too much time on his hands. That can be a dangerous combination, I think. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 17:08, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, RfA voting is more an art than exercise in strict rules -- I waived my normal concerns over tenure-length and voted for you out of a Trek-solidarity, after all.&#160;;) If the editor in question had been named "Can't sleep, Q will eat me", who knows?&#160;:) More seriously, I do wonder how many of the supports are motivated solely by the editor's <b>stupendous</b> username, whether merely having a clever name is an asset in RfA's, and whether (if that is so) this fact of RfA life is a good thing.

<p>Just thought you should know that banned user B4L is back to his old tactics at <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neowin.html" title="Neowin">Neowin</a>. That is, he's using his <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrosoft_Fanboy_491a.html" title="User:Microsoft Fanboy">User:Microsoft Fanboy</a> sock and his traced 201.29.xx addresses (right back to his old veloxzone.br) address to continually revert the page back to the same old thing that he was pushing over a month ago.</p>
<p>That is... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=36623559" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=36623559" rel="nofollow">his version</a>, which he's reverted to at least twice today today, happens to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=33516053" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=33516053" rel="nofollow">same one</a> that his sockpuppet was forcing onto the page way back on the 1st, which of course is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=32693461" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neowin&amp;oldid=32693461" rel="nofollow">same one</a> that Brazil's sock has been forcing since Christmas.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you and I agree on whether a staff list (which is an edit by a different, noninvolved user) should be in there, I think you would agree that B4L's edits that erase everything and put the page back to a state it was in over a month ago must be halted. I would recommend (since we have legit editors who still want to work on it) that we semi-protect the page. That would prevent his socks from damaging it.</p>

Here's a copy of the justification I just added after your comment:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Copyvio</b></p>
<p>I don't think that a remade Apple logo is relicensable. I think it is fair use regardless of who made it, and it doesn't belong on the Commons. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> 00:53, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Free Use of Mac Logo Grey</b></dd>
<dd>The reason why I believe I am allowed to publish this as my own work - and therefore GPL - is that it is based on a character provided by default in about just any font that comes with an Apple computer (I haven't checked the others). Therefore when I use it to stylise something out of it, I believe it is as legitimate as if I was stylising say the letter "A". I do understand that this is subject to interpretation since it is artwork that could be confused with the official logo, but I don't think this should fall under "fair use" because it <b>is</b> original artwork. Still, I will leave this to the admin's decision.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I am at your disposal should you want to discuss this interpretation but I will understand if it is removed. I think it would be sad because why provide tools if it is illegal to use them, but since I'm not a jurist...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inappropriate behavior</span></h2>
<p>I find your behavior and comments tonight unbecoming and inappropriate for an administrator. Your comments on <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Gerard_5b9e.html" title="User talk:David Gerard">User talk:David Gerard</a> are uncivil at best. Using a blanking warning template for an administrator who had deleted a page is patronizing and provocative, as if it were a new user "testing" Wikipedia out instead of an experienced Wikipedian and former arbitrator. What made you feel this would be an appropriate comment? Nor could his comment be construed as a personal attack, since not only does it not refer to anyone in particular, it does not state that they possess those qualities rather (and in fact, he expects them not to have them). Why use vandalism templates and threats of blocking rather than discussion? Especially with a fellow administrator? Do you really feel that this sort of behavior is constructive? Fortunately, David Gerard did not rise to the repeated provocation, but with a less-mature editor, this could have gotten messy. I know one user's opinion probably matters little, but I am quite disappointed to see this response from you; it is not in character. I regretted not getting around to vote in your request for adminship before it closed, but had I seen evidence of this behavior beforehand, I would have certainly opposed the request. I ask you to rethink your approach to resolving/provoking conflict. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 07:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um. I'm not entirely sure how to respond to this. Calling people "jawdroppingly stupid" is not a personal attack?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: BorgHunter</span></h2>
<p>I don't believe that I accused you of wheel warring, and I apologize if I seemed to imply it. My complaint was specifically in reference to your conduct at <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Gerard_5b9e.html" title="User talk:David Gerard">User talk:David Gerard</a>. I too have very little tolerance for personal attacks, but I think that threatening after one personal attack to block a user for the next personal attack is a little extreme, especially when the other is an experienced Wikipedia user and not a newcomer; <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> states "Sysops may block IP addresses or usernames that...[make] excessive personal attacks." While I agree that we must use our judgment and not blindly follow process, I doubt anything positive would have come out of a block; it would serve to inflame, would likely be overturned in minutes, and would likely lead to negative consequences for you as well. Especially since no one else but you seems to consider it a personal attack. It is hard for me to see how it could be construed as one, especially in the absence of a defined recipient and the lack of clear insult (saying "I expect TfD voters not to be stupid" isn't really a personal attack). For that matter, to me, your "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Gerard&amp;diff=38384014&amp;oldid=38381765" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Gerard&amp;diff=38384014&amp;oldid=38381765" rel="nofollow">And finally...drop the sarcasm, don't be a m:dick</a>" is more of a personal attack, although I certainly wouldn't block you over it. However, I consider this matter resolved, and I appreciate your response to this matter; I wish more users were as reasonable as you. The apology certainly will help to calm matters and demonstrates your good sense as well (and the Arbitration Committee obviously agrees <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war/Proposed_decision#Borghunter.27s_comments_to_David_Gerard" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war/Proposed_decision#Borghunter.27s_comments_to_David_Gerard" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war/Proposed_decision#BorgHunter" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war/Proposed_decision#BorgHunter" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Leaving Wikipedia: Apologies to BorgHunter:</span></h2>
<p><b>NOTE: From Theodore7</b>: My experience as a newcomer to Wikipedia has been horrible. Recently, I lost a good friend in a car accident and had to bury him. My heart is broken. That is why I was away. When I returned, I was surprised to find out that I had been blocked for a week. I did not know this, so had to wait until today to write. After careful consideration due to the bad experiences I've had since joining Wikipedia in December: I am leaving Wikipedia. I apologize to all who have had to spend considerable time on what I believe has been attempts at censorship and a witch-hunt. I also apologize to anyone who has taken offense to me. I did not join Wikipedia to be mean, spiteful, nor to fight with anyone. However, I apologize for my mistakes, and for my comments. They were not meant to do harm to anyone. I thought with my experience, and knowledge that I could be a positive member of the Wikipedia community. I cannot say my experience as a newcomer has been positive, it has not. I don't know why I was attacked, but having seen a good friend suddenly lose his life so horribly, I'm sorry, my heart is just so broken. Please forgive me. I am an experienced journalist &amp; editor, and above all, a kind human being. I do know, however, when I am not wanted. So, I will leave Wikipedia. I am sorry for taking the time of others who have had to spend so much time on the RFC and Arbitration. I did not intend to be such trouble for anyone. I am so sorry.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 06:21, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This project relies on considerable charitable donations and immense, incalculably large charitable contributions, among other things of time and intellectual capital - yours, and mine, and everyone else's. These <i>must</i> give people other than Jimbo - you and me - a stake in the project. I think if it were made clear that Wikipedia was operated on the basis of a dictatorship (in five months editing I have not been aware of this until now), contributions would disappear very quickly. This high-falluting talk of "the Wikimedia Foundation" is basically a sham - what you are suggesting is that this is a one man vanity project. If that is so, I want no part of it, and I don't think i'd be the only one. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 17:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely. Spread the word far and wide. If you don't want to accept the fact that *somebody* has to manage the servers and public relations, etc., you're not suited for Wikipedia anywhow. I think there's an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchopedia.html" title="Anarchopedia">Anarchopedia</a> or something like that where nobody runs the site. People who won't accept the authority of the people who own the property used to host Wikipedia really don't have any business here. Charitable donations are made with the understanding that there are no strings attached -- people are expecting Jimbo and the Foundation Board to spend the money wisely. So far, there's no reason to doubt their judgement except "OMG WIKIPEDIA'S NOT A DEMOCRACY, WTF???" which really has no bearing on the Board's or Jimbo's competency in managing our affairs. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:37, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Managing the servers requires no more control or power than managing content - there is no implication of any need for autocratic control. Look, I don't have any problem with this world view, <i>as long as it is explicit</i>. I'm just disappointed that I've been hoodwinked for 5 months. But I think that <i>you</i> will find when Wikipedia is reduced to a mixture of (i) the devoted congregation of unquestioning acolytes and (ii) a large number of unregistered vandals, it will lose much of its current attraction. My suspicion is that, therefore, this proposal will be vehemently opposed. Let's see. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 18:06, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>It's not a proposal.</b> This is how Wikipedia has been run since its inception; if anything, the process is a bit fairer now, since last time we had two dictators (Jimbo and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a>) whereas now the Board can step in and tell Jimbo to shut it if he really blows it (an unlikely occurrence). And in case you forgot, somebody has to pay for the servers, manage the accounts, buy new servers, maintain them, talk to the media with some authority (honestly, can you imagine an ordinary Wikipedian spreading his personal idea of what Wikipedia should be among the media?), etc. You tell me how the wiki can do all this. Wikipedia has been run as an autocracy since its founding. So far, there is nothing to indicate this should be changed except the paranoia of some people who can't accept a benevolent dictatorship (but have zero problems whatsoever with private organisations and businesses that, just incidentally, happen to have one CEO/Chairman of the Board/whatever). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:12, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>you cannot keep on changing comments that you've made sometime back, especially after others have commented on them. That is considered bad form and I had already asked you to desist from doing so. Repeated acts such as these waste time of other editors from the primary purpose of working on Wikipedia and could get you blocked.
<ul>
<li>I haven’t had the time today to address your comments on civility, but I wanted to clarify my remarks to make them less offensive. I did not strike my comments because I did not remove any text. Would you please post on my talk page an authoritative source that says it’s bad form to edit ones own comments after they have been commented on. Also, could you please cite the source that says that editing in this fashion can get someone blocked from wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>

<li>Just as you do not have time, others also do not have time.

Also, past conduct does play a role. I see from your talkpage that you have been blocked already once for violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. If you do feel that your comments were offensive, it would be much better if you apologize to the editors involved rather than massaging your edits.

The best thing to do is indeed to apologize to the editor(s) involved, and leave your mistakes be. We are, after all, human, and make mistakes.

I'm trying to be healthy and it won't help if my head keeps gaining weight. But seriously, BorgHunter, that's extremely kind of you! Is there something specific to which I owe this honor? I very much appreciate hearing that from you. Especially since we didn't meet under the best circumstances. But comments such as this as well as your taking responsibility for your actions show why you were elected to adminship in the first place. You have my full support. I'll definitely be adding this to my "awards" section once I restore it. Encephalon, I value your comments as always. When are you going to go up for adminship?—I've been trying to nominate this guy forever...I think he'd been here less then a month when I first told him I wanted to nominate him once he'd been here longer, but he's been refusing so far.—You now, 'Ceph, you should give Star Trek a chance. The price of seasons 1–3 of <i>The Next Generation</i> just dropped and I bought them—they're on their way to me right now! And don't look to BorgHunter for support—his username's an explicit Star Trek reference. We're everywhere! And I'll have you know that the ships and REU and such are referring to the U.S. Navy and have nothing to do with Star Trek.

<p>Hi - I just made two articles GAs which you'd removed from the self nominations page - <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terik.html" title="Terik">Terik</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defaka.html" title="Defaka">Defaka</a>. You'd said you didn't think there was enough in them to make them good articles, but length isn't really one of the GA criteria and in my opinion these are exactly the kind of article we should be listing on the GA page, as they are broad, well written, and referenced. They're probably too short to be FAs, but I think excellent short articles are one of the main things we should be identifying with GAs.</p>

Before you again say, 'discuss on talk pages' and 'try for neutral wording' please note that <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Silmarillion_0da4.html" title="Talk:The Silmarillion">I have</a>. That's the most insignificant of the numerous points on which we disagree, but indicative of the overall problem.

I think that's pretty reasonable. I can 'prove' my preference by the usual standards employed on Wikipedia, but am willing to go with non-commital language anyway. If that is unacceptable it leaves only allowing information which is <i>at best</i> POV and unverifiable (but seems to me simply 'false') to remain in the articles or some form of dispute resolution.
