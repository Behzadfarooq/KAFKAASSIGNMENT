	    <ul>
<li>T. Subbarami Reddy - Sat in jail for misappropriations during the building of Nagarjun Sagar. Now sits in parliament as a M.P. and stands out in society as a patron of the Arts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'Bombula' P. Siva Reddy - Served as (Home?) Minister in N.T.Rama Rao's cabinet. Most infamous of all factionists that he had the title of 'Bombula' affixed to his name. Lived as he died. He was killed at a marriage in the Srinagar area of Hyderabad in 1985 at the hands of his rivals who threw country bombs at him. Mercifully they did this when he was alone and not amongst people, saving innocents unlike Seenu's atempt on Paritala Ravi. N.T.Rama Rao, upon hearing the extermination of this person and wanting to score as many political points as possible had his body taken to the Governer even before the Police could properly record the crime scene. Because of the contamination of the crime scene, the prosecution could not successfully bring the perpetrators to book.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Y.S. Raja Reddy - Father of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy - Famous factionist leader. Responsible for many murders but always escaped from the lawman. Acquired nearly 1500 acres of land by finishing off his rivals. Met his end as violently as he lived. His rivals fearing that his son's rise to C.M's post would mean the annihilation of not only them but their families as well killed him by throwing a bomb at him while he was travelling by car. He had his brain blown off by the bomb. Unfortunately for them, his son soon became the C.M.. Fortunately for them with Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy being in public spotlight and all his moves being covered by the media, they are still out of his and his son's reach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy - Gandhi Family Loyalist - Became C.M of A.P solely being under the benevolent hand of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonia_Gandhi_2b56.html" title="Sonia Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a>. Responsible for illegal mining in his Baryte Mines. Was the reason for the setting up of (?Raj) commission to look into his illegal mining activities in the eighties/nineties. Paid a fine and got away with it, but still continues his mining activities. Recently declared that he would give up over 1300 acres of land that his family members had acquired during his father's reign of terror to set an 'example' for others to follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy - Son of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy - Famous for beating up his own teacher, even as a teenager in school. Slapped a policeman in Hyderabad for not letting him ride his motorbike even though he was underage and spent time in jail receiving third degree from the police. Record of this arrest has been expunged but the policeman who received the slap as well those who gave Jagan the 'royal' treatment in jail will verify this. Even <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paritala_Ravindra_c0bf.html" title="Paritala Ravindra">Paritala Ravindra</a> once accused Y. S. Jagan that Jagan was trying to kill him and was named in a charge sheet after Paritala Ravindra's execution. Y. S Jagan met Maddelacheruvu Suryanarayana Reddy in the jail with fake identities, with the help of Charlapalli Jail Superintendent for this conspiracy, but was given a clean chit by the C.B.I.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maddela Cheruvu Suryanarayana Reddy - Another inhuman person notable for the killing of another inhuman person <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paritala_Ravi_a59f.html" title="Paritala Ravi">Paritala Ravi</a>. Apparently Paritala Ravi's father Paritala Sriramulu, a former MLA, was a rival of Suryanaryana Reddy's father Narayana Reddy. Ravi killed Suryanarayana Reddy's family by planting a bomb in their television set in 1993. The complete family was wiped out except Suryanarayana (Suri) Reddy who was not at home when the explosive went off. To avenge this killing, Suri planted a car bomb to kill Paritala Ravi in Hyderabad at the muhurtam of his movie in 1997. While Paritala escaped, twenty-six others, including six members of a television crew, were killed in the blast. Suri and six others were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. From jail, his followers and/or hired thugs killed Paritala Ravi in 2005.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Julakanti Srinivas Reddy (Moddu Srinu) - Gun for hire - Paritala Ravi's Killer. Julakanti Srinivasa Reddy shot Paritala Ravi many times while killing him and in the eyes as a bonus for Suri. Escaped and gave a television interview in which he vowed to kill two more persons before surrendering to the police. Finally landed dramatically in police net when a bomb he was making went off in a lodge on the city. Cyberabad Police Commissioner M. Mahender Reddy said a .38 revolver, some detonators, <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium_nitrate.html" title="Ammonium nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> powder, batteries, fuse wires and a mobile were recovered from the lodge room. Police sources said the explosion occurred while Srinu was stuffing the ammonium nitrate powder mixed in kerosene into an empty bulb. He had come on another assasination mission to kill an advocate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nedurumalli Janardhan Reddy - 10% Man - Probably the most corrupt of all C.Ms to have ruled the state. Asked for a minimum of 10% commission to approve developmental projects in the state directly on the face of investors and convincing many of them to comply by reiterating that as long as he was in power their repective projects would be 'cleared'. Floated the idea of private 'higher studies' institutions and took advance from many investors assuring them of 'definite' allotment but nothing materialised. Minted so much money unscrupulously in such a short time that Naxals even blew up his son's businesses in Hyderabad.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakireddy_Bali_Reddy_d90e.html" title="Lakireddy Bali Reddy">Lakireddy Bali Reddy</a> - Berkeley landlord. Owner of over 1,000 apartments, two restaurants and assorted other businesses in California. In 1999, BaliReddy was Berkeley's richest landlord with an estate valued at $100m. Was known as a philanthropist, donated vast sums of money in his native village, built an engineering school and provided employment for the folks in his village by getting them into the USA as his relatives and employing them to work in his apartments and hotels. Unfortunately for him, Chanti Pratipatti, a 17 year old SC girl whom he had trafficked into the country to work on his properties as a cheap labourer, died of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning.html" title="Carbon monoxide poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> in one of his apartments bearing his child. Later on came to light that he used to engage in sexual congress with many of the cheap labourers he had illegally imported from (?Vijayawada) A.P. In 2001, Lakireddy Bali Reddy, 64-years-old was convicted of bringing young Indian girls into the country for labor and sex and was sentenced to eight years in prison. His case goes on to show how one mistake can scar your entire character and the goodwill that one has accrued over a lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kondapalli Seetharamaiah - PWG Founder - One of the founders of the Naxalite movement that took roots in <a href="../../../s/r/i/Srikakulam_district.html" title="Srikakulam district">Srikakulam district</a> in Andhra Pradesh in 1969, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah broke away from the Communist Party of India, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism-Leninism_8ebb.html" title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxist-Leninist</a>, in 1974 and followed Charu Mazumdar's line of 'annihilation of class enemies' though he belonged to Reddy caste to find the People's War Group on April 22, 1980. The PWG has since tortured, maimed and killed scores of people. So brutal was the reign of terror by PWG, that when the police caught his two sons, they killed them both, innocent victims done to death to teach their father a lesson. Ousted out of the PWG in the 1990s and arrested by police in 1993 and sentenced to spend a few years in jail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sushma Reddy - First Reddy VJ - Channel [V] - Apart from her fame, her rise to notoriety is due to the fact that she is the first famous Reddy ever to pose for a photoshoot exposing her breast for a leading publication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shilpa Reddy - Ex Miss A.P and Mrs India - Apart from her fame, her rise to notoriety is because of her checkered history of broken relationships. Was originally engaged to marry a boy, but married another. Then divorced her new husband without even stepping into his house after marriage and finally settled into marital arrangement with another boy for his money. The couple is well known in Hyderabad social circles as the Beauty and the Beast.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mona Reddy - Niece of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy - Parents were notorious as they used to ask eligle Reddy bachelors to get baptized in order to seek her hand in marriage. They did not want Hindu Reddys for their daughter, only Christian Reddys or Reddys ready to change their religion the sake of Mona.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>D.K. Aruna - Most Corrupt among all Female MLAs. - Holds the distinction for being the most corrupt of all the 28 female legislative members of the 2004 A.P. Legislative assembly, toppling even Mrs. P. Sabitha Indra Reddy. Apparently did not finish her education but has a fake degree certificate to prove to the Election Commission that she is indeed a graduate. Wife of 'spurious' liquor baron D.K. Bharat Simha Reddy and daughter of mild mannered Makhtal MLA Chittem Narsi Reddy. Demands a percentage of any developmental works, without which goons under her husband attack people and stop all work. (Kranthi Constructions carrying out work near Sangala Reservoir will verify this). In 2005, Naxalites had declared that they would kill Narsi Reddy, his daughter D K Aruna and son-in-law Bharat Simha Reddy knowing that they were responsible for the sale and distribution of illicit liquor in Mahabubnagar district which was causing untold suffering and health problems to villagers. Naxalites made true their promise on Aug 15, 2005 by killing the 76-year-old Narsi Reddy, his son Venkateshwar Reddy and their followers. After this, Lakshmi, wife of Narsi Reddy's eldest son Venkateshwar Reddy was very keen to contest on Congress ticket for the byelections. But, D K Aruna and her scheming husband D K Bharata Simha Reddy, brought pressure on the Chief Minister as well as PCC president K Kesava Rao to give the ticket to C Rammohan Reddy, younger son of Narsi Reddy. Rammohan Reddy has a partnership in Bharata Simha Reddy's illicit liquor business and is also a close follower of his sister Aruna. They did not want Lakshmi to become an MLA, as she would definitely find about their illegal activities which caused the death of her husband and father-in-law at the hands of the self styled Narsa Cobra Naxalites.</li>
