<p>The Border Campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, when the harsh security measures of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> governments had almost destroyed the organisation. In 1939 the IRA had tried a <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage_Campaign_%28IRA%29_b7f4.html" title="Sabotage Campaign (IRA)">bombing campaign in England</a> to try to force British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. From 1942-1944 it also had an ineffective <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Campaign_%28IRA%29_066c.html" title="Northern Campaign (IRA)">campaign</a> in Northern Ireland. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment.html" title="Internment">Internment</a> on both sides of the border as well as internal feuding and disputes over future policy all but destroyed the organisation. These campaigns were officially called off on March 10, 1945.</p>
<p>By 1947, the IRA had only 200 activists according to its own general staff.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In theory, the IRA wished to overthrow both "partitionist" states in Ireland, which it deemed to be illegitimate entities, imposed by Britain at the time of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_Treaty_db3e.html" title="Anglo-Irish Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> in 1922. However, in 1948, the Chief of Staff, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Magan_4d3a.html" title="Tony Magan">Tony Magan</a> issued General Order Number 8, prohibiting "any armed action whatsoever" against the forces of the Republic of Ireland. This amounted to a de facto recognition of the Southern Irish state. From now on, armed action would be focussed on Northern Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom and which was dominated by Protestant <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionists</a>. The idea of a campaign launched from the Republic against Northern Ireland, first mooted by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Barry_7881.html" title="Tom Barry">Tom Barry</a> in the 1930s, gained currency within IRA circles as the 1950s went on.</p>
<p>By the middle of this decade, moreover, the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. Arms were taken from <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omagh.html" title="Omagh">Omagh</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armagh.html" title="Armagh">Armagh</a>. At the latter raid on Gough barracks in Armagh in June 1954, the IRA seized 250 <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Enfield_503f.html" title="Lee Enfield">Lee Enfield</a> rifles, 37 sub machine guns, 9 <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bren_gun.html" title="Bren gun">bren guns</a> and 40 training rifles.</p>
<p>By 1955, splits were occurring in the IRA, as several small groups, impatient for action, launched their own attacks in Northern Ireland. One such activist, Brendan O'Boyle blew himself up with his own bomb in the summer of that year. Another, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Kelly_757f.html" title="Liam Kelly">Liam Kelly</a> founded a breakaway group <a href="../../../s/a/o/Saor_Uladh_2a66.html" title="Saor Uladh">Saor Uladh</a> ("Free Ulster") and in November 1955, attacked a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary_fcdf.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> barracks at <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roslea.html" title="Roslea">Roslea</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Fermanagh_5317.html" title="County Fermanagh">county Fermanagh</a>. One RUC man was badly injured and a Republican fighter was killed in the incident. In August of the following year, Kelly and another IRA dissident, Joe Christle, burned down some customs posts on the border.</p>
<p>In November 1956, the IRA finally began its own border campaign. They were partly motivated by a desire to prevent any more splits in their organisation. They were also encouraged by the results of the British General Election of 1956, in which two <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_Fein_8f5c.html" title="Sinn Fein">Sinn Fein</a> (since 1949, the IRA’s political wing) candidates were elected in Northern Ireland, with a total of 152,310 votes. This appeared to show that there was a substantial <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_1080.html" title="Irish Republican">Irish Republican</a> support base within Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_Campaign_%28IRA%29_90ae.html" title="Edit section: Planning the Campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Planning the Campaign</span></h2>
<p>The plan for the Border Campaign — codenamed, "Operation Harvest" — was devised by Sean Cronin. It envisaged flying columns, initially four of about 50 men each, operating from within the Republic of Ireland attacking military and infrastructure targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA document seized in the Republic in 1956 stated that the aim of the campaign was to: "break down the enemy’s administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces. Our method of doing this is guerrilla warfare within the occupied area and propaganda directed at its inhabitants. In time as we build up our forces, we hope to be in a position to liberate large areas and tie these in with other liberated areas — that is areas where the enemy’s writ no longer runs"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The reference to "liberated areas" shows that IRA leaders had been influenced to some degree by <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maoist.html" title="Maoist">Maoist</a> guerrilla ideas. For further discussion of IRA military thinking see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Book_%28IRA_training_manual%29_e994.html" title="The Green Book (IRA training manual)">The Green Book (IRA training manual)</a>.</p>
<p>No actions were to take place in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, the capital and biggest city in Northern Ireland. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, the IRA in the city was believed to have been infiltrated by informers. Secondly, it was implicitly recognised that IRA actions in Belfast would provoke reprisals by <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalists.html" title="Loyalists">loyalists</a> against the Catholic/nationalist population there. This had happened on a large scale in 1920-22, during and after the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_War_of_Independence_d28c.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_Campaign_%28IRA%29_90ae.html" title="Edit section: The Campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Campaign</span></h2>
<p>The campaign was launched with simultaneous attacks by around 150 IRA men on targets on the Border on the night of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> 1956. A <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> relay transmitter was bombed in Derry, a courthouse was burned in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magherafelt.html" title="Magherafelt">Magherafelt</a>, as was a <a href="../../../b/-/s/B-Specials_b818.html" title="B-Specials">B-Specials</a> post near <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newry.html" title="Newry">Newry</a> and a half built Army barracks at <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enniskillen.html" title="Enniskillen">Enniskillen</a> was blown up. A raid on Gough barracks in Armagh was beaten off after a brief exchange of fire.</p>
<p>The IRA issued a statement on 12 December announcing the start of the Campaign, "Spearheaded by Ireland’s freedom fighters, our people have carried the fight to the enemy…Out of this national liberation struggle a new Ireland will emerge, upright and free. In that new Ireland, we shall build a country fit for all our people to live in. That then is our aim: an independent, united, democratic Irish Republic. For this we shall fight until the invader is driven from our soil and victory is ours"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>On December 14, an IRA column under <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Garland_db37.html" title="Sean Garland">Sean Garland</a> detonated four bombs (one of which blew in the front wall) outside Lisnaskea RUC station before raking it with gunfire. Further attacks on <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derrylin.html" title="Derrylin">Derrylin</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roslea.html" title="Roslea">Roslea</a> RUC barracks on the same day were beaten off.</p>
<p>In response, on December 21, 1956, the government of Northern Ireland under <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Brooke_b22a.html" title="Basil Brooke">Basil Brooke</a> used its <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Powers_Act_b680.html" title="Special Powers Act">Special Powers Act</a> to intern several hundred Republican suspects without trial. This, in time, severely limited the IRA’s capacity to build up units within Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1957, an IRA column under Noel Kavanagh attacked the Derrylin RUC barracks again, killing RUC constable John Scally, the first fatality of the campaign. The following day, Sean Garland and <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1ith%C3%AD_%C3%93_Conaill_fe55.html" title="Dáithí Ó Conaill">Dáithí Ó Conaill</a> led an attack on the Police station at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookeborough.html" title="Brookeborough">Brookeborough</a>. Two IRA men, <a href="../../../s/e/%C3%A1/Se%C3%A1n_South_1606.html" title="Seán South">Seán South</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergal_O%27Hanlon_45ad.html" title="Fergal O'Hanlon">Fergal O'Hanlon</a>, were killed in the abortive attack. Garland was seriously wounded in the raid. He and the remainder of the group were pursued back over the border by 400 RUC, <a href="../../../b/_/s/B_Specials_ee5a.html" title="B Specials">B Specials</a> and British soldiers.</p>
<p>The funerals of South and O’Hanlon in the Republic produced a strong emotional reaction among the general public there. The two men are still considered martyrs in Irish Republican circles <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. Up to 50,000 people attended their funerals.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, the Republic’s government, led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Costello_cc32.html" title="John Costello">John Costello</a> of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_Gael_b9bc.html" title="Fine Gael">Fine Gael</a>, feared that the IRA’s action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain and in January 1957, it used the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offences_against_the_State_Acts_1939-1998_1543.html" title="Offences against the State Acts 1939-1998">Offences Against the State Act</a> to arrest most of the IRA’s leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Sean Cronin. Fine Gael’s coalition partner, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clann_na_Poblachta_069e.html" title="Clann na Poblachta">Clann na Poblachta</a> (led by former IRA Chief of Staff <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_MacBride_da51.html" title="Sean MacBride">Sean MacBride</a>) resigned from government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1957.html" title="Irish general election, 1957">Irish general election, 1957</a>, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes (c. 5% of those cast).</p>
<p>However, the new government, of <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_Fail_e287.html" title="Fianna Fail">Fianna Fail</a>, led by <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_de_Valera_90a6.html" title="Eamon de Valera">Eamon de Valera</a> proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.</p>
<p>The year 1957 was the most active year of the IRA's campaign, with 341 incidents recorded. In the summer of 1958, two IRA men (James Crossan and Aloysius Hand) were killed in separate gun battles with the RUC. In November 1958, the IRA suffered its worst loss of life in the period when four of its members died preparing a bomb in a farm house at Edentubber, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Louth_839a.html" title="County Louth">county Louth</a>, which exploded prematurely. The civilian owner of the house was also killed. In 1959, only 77 incidents were recorded in the campaign and in 1960, this fell to just 26. Moreover, many of these actions consisted of minor acts of sabotage, for example the cratering of roads.</p>
<p>The final fatality of the conflict came in November 1961, when an RUC officer, William Hunter, was killed in a gun battle with the IRA in south <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Armagh_05d8.html" title="County Armagh">county Armagh</a>.</p>

<p>By late 1961, the campaign was effectively over. It had cost the lives of eight IRA men and four republican supporters. Six RUC members had been killed and 32 wounded. A total of 256 Republicans were interned in Northern Ireland in this period and another 150 or so in the Republic. Of those in Northern Ireland, 89 had signed a pledge to renounce violence in return for their freedom.</p>
<p>That the IRA’s campaign had run its course by 1960 is testified by the fact that the Republic of Ireland's government released its internees (judging them to be no further threat) in that year. The Northern Irish government followed suit on the 25 April 1961.</p>
<p>Although it had petered out by the late 1950s, the Campaign was officially called off on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>.

<p>Implicit in the statement was a recognition that the IRA, after a promising start in 1957, had failed to mobilise much popular support behind its campaign.</p>

<p>The Border Campaign was considered a disaster by the IRA, not least because it enjoyed practically no support from the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalism.html" title="Irish nationalism">nationalist</a> population of Northern Ireland. This failure pushed some within the organisation to consider other avenues in pursuit of the organisation's goals. Many of those involved with the Border Campaign felt that their lack of support was due to a failure to address the social and economic issues face by ordinary people.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathal_Goulding_c181.html" title="Cathal Goulding">Cathal Goulding</a>, who became IRA Chief of Staff in 1962, tried to move the IRA away from pure militarism and towards left wing and ultimately <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> politics. This process ended with the 1969/70 split in the republican movement between the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_IRA_1706.html" title="Official IRA">Official IRA</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_04d7.html" title="Provisional IRA">Provisional IRA</a> wings. The Officials, under Goulding wanted to move towards parliamentary politics, while the Provisionals under <a href="../../../r/u/a/Ruair%C3%AD_%C3%93_Br%C3%A1daigh_1f80.html" title="Ruairí Ó Brádaigh">Ruairí Ó Brádaigh</a>, wanted to maintain the movement's traditional goals. More immediately, the Provisional faction wanted to use armed force to defend the Catholic community in Belfast from loyalist attacks in the civil strife that had broken out in Northern Ireland (the start of the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a>"). Ultimately the Provisionals also wanted to re-build the IRA's military capacity to launch a new armed campaign.</p>
<p>The two sides went their separate ways in 1969, but both were drawn into the communal conflict within Northern Ireland. The <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_IRA_1706.html" title="Official IRA">Official IRA</a> maintained armed actions up until 1972, but characterised them as "defensive". Feuds between the two IRAs in the 1970s claimed about twenty lives. The Provisional IRA launched what turned out to be a much more sustained and destructive campaign than the Border Campaign — the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_campaign_1969%E2%80%931997_dfaf.html" title="Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997">Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997</a>, which was to claim up to 1,800 lives.</p>
