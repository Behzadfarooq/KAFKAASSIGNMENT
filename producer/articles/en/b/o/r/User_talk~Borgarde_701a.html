<p>Hi, and glad to see that you wish to contribute!</p>
<p>I am a bit concerned that several of your recent song articles are very short, only a sentence long, and therefore not very useful to the reader (the same information can be had from reading the articles on the album). You might want to look at some of the common pitfalls at <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">Wikipedia:Your first article</a>. In many cases, you can place <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirects</a> at the songs so that they point back to the album where you can add a short description. If the song really deserves a seperate article on the other hand, it is perhaps best to write a paragraph <i>about</i> the song, and not just a sentence saying it is a song. Happy editing!<a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with this. Wikipedia doesn't need an article about every song on every album. Song articles are usually created for charting songs or important songs on albums. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter GÃ¶rlitz">Walter GÃ¶rlitz</a> 14:52, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why are you deleting singles? Non-noteworthy I can see, but why singles? Singles have chart information that can be included, and I'm sure there is more information that can be added.

<p>Hi, generally individual songs only get their own individual pages if they've been released as singles in their own right, or are otherwise noteworthy. A standard album track doesn't warrant it's own article normally. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.68.109.234.html" title="User:84.68.109.234">84.68.109.234</a> 11:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure on all the defunct clubs though, I know there are some clubs going around right now that are mergers of 2 other clubs, if you add one with the current clubs maybe? and if information expands add defunct?

<p>Hi - I see you have created a new stub type, Australian-baseball-stub. As it clearly explains at <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a>, and at the top of most stub categories, all new stub types should be proposed prior to creation at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>, so that they can be checked for viability, and to make sure they don't go against either the stub category hierarchy or stub naming conventions. In the case of your new stub type, it was not proposed, and currently it doesn't look likely it will reach the required 60 stubs to be regarded as viable. The stub type has been listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Discoveries_017f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries</a> - please make any comments as to the reasons for and possible population of this new stub type. Be warned that it may be nominated for deletion via <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>. Please, in future, if you wish to create a new stub type, propose it first! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I understand your concern. The stub was created as part of a wikiproject, it will meet the required 60 stubs easily. When I created the stub I read all the processes before doing it, but I also read an article that was an official policy that said ignore all rules if the edit you are doing is for the <b>better</b>. And this is helping to organise, it's clearly making it easier to edit articles related to Australian Baseball. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgarde_770d.html" title="User:Borgarde">Borgarde</a> 08:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>the assessment of articles should be preety straight forwed, however i believe it will be easier if just one person does the rating, iv gone through and rated all the articles that have the WikiProject template on them.</p>
<p>When the template is added to any new or existing articles ratings <b>should not</b> be added, this way they will appear in <a href="../../../u/n/a/Category%7EUnassessed_Australian_Baseball_articles_97aa.html" title="Category:Unassessed Australian Baseball articles">Category:Unassessed Australian Baseball articles</a> and not skew the figures on the table {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_Baseball_Australian_Baseball_articles_by_quality_statistics_1e27.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian Baseball/Australian Baseball articles by quality statistics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian Baseball/Australian Baseball articles by quality statistics</a>}}, then from time to time we can update the table fairly easily.(if this has made any sense ill be happy) cheers mate --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan027_5e71.html" title="User:Dan027">Dan027</a> 11:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Hey, I've had a look at your WatchlistBot, and wondering if you'd be able to help with {{<a href="../../../b/a/s/Template%7EBaseball-WikiProject_a71c.html" title="Template:Baseball-WikiProject">Baseball-WikiProject</a>}} tagging? There is thousands of untagged articles under the parent category <a href="../../../b/a/s/Category%7EBaseball_e68e.html" title="Category:Baseball">Category:Baseball</a>.

<p>The bot can easily do what you need. I've started by creating a list for you at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Baseball_Articles_dc58.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball/Articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball/Articles</a>. It lists all articles that are currently tagged. Please check the list of categories. If I run the bot, it will tag all articles in all of the tagged categories. Please check if there are any categories that might contain articles which don't relate to baseball. Also, if there are other categories, I can use the bot to tag them (by starting at <a href="../../../b/a/s/Category%7EBaseball_e68e.html" title="Category:Baseball">Category:Baseball</a> and traversing the hierarchy), but I might need your help to figure out which ones to tag (sometimes they're not obvious).

<dd><i>Yes. Cricket is the dominant summer sport in Australia. Baseball still exists all around the country, but at it's current stage, only in amateur competitions (summer and winter), there are also yearly "semi-pro" competitions between all states called the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claxton_Shield_003f.html" title="Claxton Shield">Claxton Shield</a>. There is news about a professional national league starting up for the summer of 07/08, so that'll be awesome if that happens. Right now the only TV coverage of baseball is on cable TV, under ESPN, Fox-sports for Major League Baseball, whereas Cricket is available on free-to-air TV with Australia being one of the strongest cricket playing countries in the world. Cricket also has a lot more publicity.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>It depends on which area of the English speaking world you live in. If you live in Iowa or Kansas, then I am sure no one would even know where Taiwan is. I add Republic of China on Taiwan for clarification purposes when necessary. I would suggest that you also do that because it provides a NPOV. Everyone in Taiwan can actually agree to that, even the DPP and KMT. Meanwhile, if you have Republic of China (Taiwan), some people dispute that because () is equating ROC to Taiwan and to people that is not true. No one disputes the fact that the ROC is now based on Taiwan. So I would suggest doing that if necessary for clarification. But in some official government/political contexts, Republic of China should be used. It really depends. And usually you would find Taiwan in front of the Republic of China, so obviously, everyone knows it is Taiwan and ROC and not Mainland China and the PRC. -<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalist_3959.html" title="User:Nationalist">Nationalist</a> 02:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks. <font color="red"><b>Ksy92003</b></font> <sup><a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">User</font></a><b>Â·</b><a href="../../../k/s/y/User_talk%7EKsy92003_106c.html" title="User talk:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">talk</font></a><b>Â·</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ksy92003_f0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ksy92003"><font color="gray">contribs</font></a></sup> <font color="blue">05:30, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p>I just think it would do good to specialize them a bit more. "Players" is pretty broad. Break them up into time-periods, or levels of greatness or something. I mean, I know 80's and 90's players very well, as well as the era between the wars. Those are pretty distinct time frames to work from and would leave other people, say, to work on the first expansion era or stuff like that.</p>
<p>There should be more task forces. That's my input. If you want help in creating them I'd be more than happy.</p>
