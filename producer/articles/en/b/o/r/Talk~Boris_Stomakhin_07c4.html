<p>Biophys, I've read the articles of Novodvorskaya and nowhere in them Stomakhin was described as "peaceful political dissident". <a href="http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/FSB/m.114531.html" class="external free" title="http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/FSB/m.114531.html" rel="nofollow">http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/FSB/m.114531.html</a> <a href="http://grani.ru/opinion/novodvorskaya/m.114765.html" class="external free" title="http://grani.ru/opinion/novodvorskaya/m.114765.html" rel="nofollow">http://grani.ru/opinion/novodvorskaya/m.114765.html</a></p>
<p>The same is true for Gannushkina for in your source there is no description of Stomakhin by Gannushkina as "peaceful political dissident" <a href="http://www.grani.ru/Society/Law/m.114655.html" class="external free" title="http://www.grani.ru/Society/Law/m.114655.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.grani.ru/Society/Law/m.114655.html</a></p>
<p>As for both of them in their opinions <b>they do not talk at all about free speech</b> -- they talk about definition of hate speech and about whether the articles of Stomakhin could incite real actions.</p>
<p>Your passage on opinion of Novodvorskaya and Ganuushkina is a product of your original research which is forbidden in biographies. You should either rewrite it according to the sources, or delete it. I will delete it, in case you wouldn't rewrite it according to the sources.</p>
<p>I think you should read the sources before putting them in Encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 11:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Stomakhin" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Stomakhin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Stomakhin</a> I would like to note, that although Boris Stomakhin is not dissedent for he called for violent change of constitutional regime and called to exterminate Russian people as ethnicity, <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> intentionally and maliciously described in categories Stomakhin as dissident. The definition of dissident is wrong even according to Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to note, that Boris Stomakhin is not political prisoner, as Wikipedia states political prisoner "is someone held in prison or otherwise detained, perhaps under house arrest, because their ideas or image are deemed by a government to either challenge or threaten the authority of the state. However, it also happens that political prisoners are arrested and tried with a veneer of legality, where false criminal charges, manufactured evidence, and unfair trials are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner.. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner</a>.</p>
<p>Boris Stomakhin <b>was convicted not by the initiative of the government</b>, but by the initiative of the abused ordinary people, which could be clearly seen from the official convictions and court sentence. No trial abuse, no false criminal charges, no manufacured evidence ever existed or were proved in fair trial. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> published false information in his article "Human rights in Russia" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Russia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Russia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Russia</a> which was created , and contributed by him personally, and systematically tries to find ways to make false information to seem true. With this goal he describes Stomakhin as dissident(peaceful politician trying to change regime in non-violent ways) and political prisoner. The reason for these actions is that in his article "Human rights in Russia" he wrote that Stomakhin is a political prisoner.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> systematically tries to advance his own opinion and through summary making process tries to remove substantial facts about Boris Stomakhin in his article. Although administrator Alex Bacharev resolved one dispute arised between us, he tried to remove the consensus version of Stomakhin's citations which proved his own opinion wrong and which is sourced according to Wikipedia standards.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> also creates articles about institutions where he presents them from only one biased sides in order to support his underlying article "Human rights in Russia".<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since Stomakind did nothing violent, he is a peaceful <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissident.html" title="Dissident">dissident</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_prisoner.html" title="Political prisoner">political prisoner</a> according to Wikipedia definitions. What is the difference between him and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Sinyavsky_d0b3.html" title="Andrei Sinyavsky">Andrei Sinyavsky</a>? They wrote very different things, but they both were prosectuted for their writings and defamed by court as criminals. Even Maksim Sokolov regognizes that Stomakind was prosecuted (and rightly so! - according to Sokolov) for his writings. Threfore, they both are <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissidents.html" title="Dissidents">dissidents</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_prisoners.html" title="Political prisoners">political prisoners</a>.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 05:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stomakhin is not a dissident. "A dissident, broadly defined, is a person who actively opposes an established opinion, policy, or structure". See here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident</a>.</p>
<p>There is no established opinion, policy, or structure on the Chechnya in Russian Federation and Mr. Stomakhin himself is the best living evidence of this fact. If I has disagreements with you, am I also a dissident and victim of <strike>political</strike> your prosecution?</p>
<p>Stomakhin is the political opponent of the ruling party. Do not victimize him and do not make any parallels with "soviet dissidents" such as academic Sakharov.</p>
<p>Second, "the term was introduced to describe intellectual opposition to non-capitalist regimes, conducted without plans or capability for a regime change, coup, or uprising". See here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Stomakhin never represented the opinion of intellectual opposition and his views were never shared by the democratic parties in Russian Federation. The ruling party in Russian Federation does support capitalism. Mr. Stomkhin called not for peacefull and legal change of the constitutional regime, but for violent and unlawful change of it. He also was gathering funds for financing these activities.</p>
<p>Considering that all the criteria of the term dissident which are covered in the related article of Wikipedia for this term are not met, I changed his description for "opposition figure". He certainly can't be called "opposition leader" since his RCA counted only 5 members.</p>

<p>I made a few minor changes. Now this article seems to be fair enough except one thing: citation in the end. I believe this citation violates Wikipedia policy on biographies of living persons for two reasons. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>First</b>, this citation was intentionally selected from many writings by Stomakhin and taken out of context to discredit him as an idiot and "extremist". It is more appropriate to describe his ideas briefly, objectively, and in general terms, as recommended by Wikipedia policies. I included new "Political views" section for this purpose. I must admit that the cited portion of the text looks really stupid. Someone says that nuclear weapons must be used against Russian Federation. But who should use those weapons? Author does not say that. Chechen rebels? They do not have such weapons. China? USA? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that you can't do original research, I have cited Stomakhin's words and have identified reliable sources of them. I don't have to prove anything. These words are widely cited by Izvestia newspaper. As you have cited Human Rights article about the intention of prosecution to render Stomakhin mentally ill, then I could cite the words of Stomakhin to make readers judge themselves. You shouldn't worry yourself with the explanation of Stomakhin's citations, as you are not a collective reader or Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 19:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Second</b>, it is unclear if Stomakin actually wrote this. The original source is a blog run by several young people who are not responsible for anything. Russian newspaper "Izvestia" does not cite its original source, but this is probably the same blog. I am so careful because one of the sources says that Stomakhin was convicted for an article he actually did not write (although this is not the article cited here). So, some manipulations by the Russian authorities have been already claimed. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Marsho.net is not a blog, but hosting for radical organizations websites where Revolutionary Contact Association of Stomakhin is hosted. Please, prove the opposite with the evidence. His website contains the whole archive of "Radikalnaya Politika", the programms of RCA and their official statements that are cited by lenta.ru, utro.ru - all the news portals, all the articles are signed by Stomakhin personally. This website address is given in some numbers of "Radikalnyja Politika" as an address of RCA. I have also cited specific source for these specific citations - newspaper Izvestia. You don't know what is the source of Izvestia journalist, and therefore you couldn't be judging reliability of his source. You have no any sound arguments. "Probably" is not an argument. The source saying that Stomakhin was convicted for an article he actually did not write -- contradicts to the official court sentence. You may cite it, but you can't prohibit me to point to the other sources which are as reliable as yours. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 19:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I oppose your description of Stomakhin as marginal. The Wikipedia article on extremism says that extremism is used as a synonim to radicalism. The definition of marginalism does not contain radicalism criteria and doesn't fit Stomakhin's views.</p>

<p>The term "extremist" is used to describe groups and individuals who have become radicalized, in some way, even though the term radical originally meant to go to the root of a (social) problem. The term "radical" is a somewhat less negatively-connoted label sometimes used by radical individuals or groups to label themselves.</p>

<p>I think some of our differences can be resolved by simply following Wikipedia guidelines. They say:</p>
<p>"This article must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons. Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous."</p>
<p>They also say: "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking. See self-published sources for exceptions."</p>
<p>"A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field."</p>
<p>We do not even know if this RCO web site is a "self-published" (I mean published by Stomakhin) source. So we must agree that we do not cite tis site. Of course, one can cite Maksim Sokolov and say that he cited a statement "allegedly made by Stomakhih".

<p>СМЕРТЬ РОССИИ! Аслан Масхадов стал Шахидом, инша Аллах. Отныне он следующий в списке величайших людей нашего времени, борцов и героев, вслед за первым президентом ЧРИ Джохаром Дудаевым, Зелимханом Яндарбиевым, Русланом Гелаевым, Салманом Радуевым...</p>
<p>Их всех убила Россия. Кровавая, подлая, изуверская, проклятая Россия. Та, которая всегда убивала всех героев и храбрецов, боровшихся веками за освобождение своих народов от ее ига. Русские поля и леса набрякли кровью покоренных, порабощенных, изничтоженных и убитых русскими детей, стариков, женщин, мужчин, целых народов и самых известных их воинов и вождей. Горе народу, решившему строить свое счастье на крови и несчастье других...</p>
<p>«О ненависти к русским никто и не говорил». Как и во времена Толстого, ненависть - слишком мелкое, слабое, мягкое чувство, не годящееся, чтобы выразить всю глубину той бездны, которая отделяет кремлевских вурдалаков и их карательно-террористические банды в Чечне от человечества, живущего по законам совести и правды. Убийство Масхадова ничего уже не добавит к этой пропасти отчуждения, к этой античеловеческой сути российской власти и самой России. Мученичество - удел немногих, и для президента Масхадова, верим мы в это или нет, место в раю было зарезервировано уже давным-давно, ибо убитые в битвах с Россией попадают прямиком в рай, какие бы ошибки ни совершали они в земной жизни...</p>
<p>С Россией нет и не может быть никаких переговоров, о которых так много говорил Аслан Масхадов. Россию можно только уничтожить. И ее НАДО уничтожить, - это мера превентивной самообороны рода человеческого от той изуверской дьявольщины, которую несет в себе Россия со времен первых массовых убийств и казней за критику властей, со времен взятия Новгорода и Казани. <b>Русских надо убивать, и только убивать - среди них нет тех нормальных, умных, интеллигентных, с которыми можно было бы говорить и на понимание которых можно было бы надеяться. Должна быть введена жесткая коллективная ответственность всех русских, всех лояльных граждан России за действия избираемых ими властей, - за геноцид, за массовые убийства, казни, пытки, торговлю трупами... Никакого деления убийц на мирных и немирных, сознательных и невольных отныне быть не должно.</b> Словом, хотя бы снимая шапку перед свежей могилой Аслана Масхадова, пора наконец признать, что в своем упорном стремлении воевать с русскими согласно Женевским конвенциям он был глубоко неправ. Его смерть, увы, только еще раз подтвердила это.</p>
<p>Отныне официально и открыто должно быть провозглашена полная невозможность остаться «в составе России» не только Чечни, но и всего Северного Кавказа. Ингушетия, Дагестан, Карачаево-Черкесия, Кабардино-Балкария, Осетия и Адыгея потеряны для русских оккупантов навсегда. Джихад убийцам и поработителям должен быть объявлен каждым человеком на Земле, у кого они еще не успели вытравить и растлить совесть, чувство долга и любовь к свободе. Чем больше будет убито полевых командиров и руководителей кавказского Сопротивления - тем хуже должна быть участь оккупантов, тем более сурово и беспощадно должны убивать их оставшиеся в живых и занявшие место убитых. Око, за око, зуб за зуб!</p>
<p><b>Убивать, убивать, убивать! Залить кровью всю Россию, не давать ни малейшей пощады никому, постараться непременно устроить хотя бы один ядерный взрыв на территории РФ - вот какова должна быть программа радикального Сопротивления, и русского, и чеченского, и любого! Пусть русские по заслугам пожинают то, что они плодили.</b></p>
<p>Смерть русским оккупантам! Смерть изуверской кровавой империи! Свободу порабощенным ею народам!</p>

<dd>I can only repeat that two first sentences in citation of Stomakhin's paper "Death of Russia" by Sokolov can not be found in the comlete text of this article in RKO site, which you claim is a reiable source. <b>Judging from such discrepancies, it is possible that Stomakhin never wrote such article</b> (as we know, KGB/FSB has produced many false "documents" in the past) . That is why this article was not cited in the court sentence, although they tried to find most "extreme" and incriminating texts. Moreover, the text of "Death to Russia" is so increadibly stupid! It is rather different from other texts written by Stomakhin.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 00:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you should learn to read discussion page with more attention. I wouldn't be writing the same twice again. I repeat. There are no similar cases to Stomakhin case. The words of Stomakhin defender are not supported with links. You falsify associations: convicted for words doesn't mean convicted for political reason and doesn't mean political prisoner or dissident. You have too large citations with the information which is not relevant. You falsify the information in my links - you have changed the link from newspaper Utro - to FSB - which is falsification according to Wikipedia guidelines. Hate speech and calls to violent change of constitutional regime are not the features of dissidents. You are trying to falsify the information by links to absolutely non-relevant artices and categories. This is called vandalism. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 08:09, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You deleted my text about political prisoners with reference to statement by <a href="../../../a/r/t/ARTICLE_19_bcd8.html" title="ARTICLE 19">ARTICLE 19</a>, and you deleted text with statement by Director of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Councils_for_Soviet_Jews_92fd.html" title="Union of Councils for Soviet Jews">Union of Councils for Soviet Jews</a>. You say it is too long. No, it is not. This organization condems the court sentence. But why? May be this sentence was just? Mr. Naftalin explains why, so I included his explanations. <b>This is especially important because Mr. Naftalin is a representative of an ethnic minority, and he says that the law intended to protect minorities is actually used to punish a representative of an ethnic minority.</b><a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:50, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The link to newspaper UTRO works for 4 years already and no one except of you had ever complained. Nafalin's statement, however brings no specific charges for specific persons. There are just empty words not supported by any facts. And there are a 100 empty words of useless information that make more than half of the passage dedicated to opinions just to please sole want of Biophys to cite and to exaggerate one POV over other. <b>I think you could summarize his view in one sentence, just like any other opinions are summarized, what I've done and what you call 'vandalism'.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let us look at specific case of <b>you citing Micah H. Naftalin, Director of Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, foreign NGO, said: "Bogus charges aimed at stifling dissent, cruel police tactics, ethnic bias, and blatant disregard for criminal procedural statutes are all on open display. We hope that others will join us in condemning this travesty of justice" [6] He explained: "This sentence exposes the underlying hypocrisy of the Russian government's half-hearted struggle against extremist groups and hate speech. This month alone, the FSB refused to investigate the distribution of a neo-Nazi hit list containing the names and addresses of human rights activists whom the authors 'sentenced to death,' a publisher of a newspaper in Ulyanovsk who publicly called for the murder of Jews got a suspended sentence, and three youths who broke the jaw and fractured the skull of the Minister of Culture of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic while screaming racist slogans were sentenced to just six months to a year in prison. You don't have to agree with Mr. Stomakhin's radical, though non-violent, views on Chechnya to see that his sentence was disproportionate and unjust." [10]</b></p>
<p>Except for the first sentence which I left in the article, the following second passage could be summarized in less than one sentence: <b>too harsh sentence for Stomakhin, a POV that was already cited in Novodvorskaya and Gannushkina POV</b>. <b>Let me remind your words that 'we should summarize when it is possible'. Please adhere or stick to your own words and orders.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree. He explains his position (otherwise it is completely unclear!). It is important that all opinions on the subject would be explained and represented. This is a notable opinion, because Mr. Naftalin is a director of a notable organization described in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is not about explanations of Naftalin, this article is about Boris Stomakhin. We do not cite explanations of any other person stating his position on Stomakhin's trial.

<p>The second case, "Putting people in prison for words is unfathomable.", said Boris Timoshenko of the Glasnost Protection Foundation. [8]</p>
<p>Here we have absolutely irrelevant statement, as we all know that people sue each other ordinarily for just words, in cases of libel and slander. <b>And there are laws in all civilized countries that provide criminal liablity for slander and libel.

<p>Please see the official court sentence in which collegues of Stomakhin tell that he never organized himself the demonstrations, but participated in ones organized by other political organizations and parties.

On the official Revolutionary Contact Association website there are photos of their pickets which show that these are really not demonstrations with 5 to 7 participants wearing hand-made logos and slogans.

<p>2)Stomakhin's lawyer, Alexey Golubev, who in an interview to RIA Novosti, <a href="http://rian.ru/defense_safety/investigations/20061005/54549461.html" class="external free" title="http://rian.ru/defense_safety/investigations/20061005/54549461.html" rel="nofollow">http://rian.ru/defense_safety/investigations/20061005/54549461.html</a> and <a href="http://rian.ru/society/20061124/55959089.html" class="external free" title="http://rian.ru/society/20061124/55959089.html" rel="nofollow">http://rian.ru/society/20061124/55959089.html</a>, and to BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_6152000/6152608.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_6152000/6152608.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_6152000/6152608.stm</a> acknowledged the fact, that Stomakhin jumped himself from the window. Here is the citation:</p>

<p>Therefore statement by Union of Councils for Jews in the Former Soviet Union is false, as probably all other statements of this organization including its Director Micah H. Naftalin.</p>

<p>I would like to bring attention of all users of Wikipedia and its administrators that the user Biophys himself was falsely accusing me of publishing links to what he identified as blogs. He cited to me the Wikipedia policy on reliable sources. It says that the information in blog may be cited only when it is written by subject himself. But the citation and material at blog <a href="http://stomakhin.livejournal.com" class="external free" title="http://stomakhin.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">http://stomakhin.livejournal.com</a> were written on November 22nd, 2006 which is clearly shown in the blog. And there is absolutely true information that Boris Stomakhin was at this time in jail under arrest and therefore he couldn't have written this blog entry.</p>
<p>I have published the links to the Revolutionary Contact Association website - <a href="http://rko.marsho.net" class="external free" title="http://rko.marsho.net" rel="nofollow">http://rko.marsho.net</a> - which really not a blog.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Statement of Union of Councils for Soviet Jews contains false facts</span></h2>
<p>User Biophys inserted the following passage in the article</p>
<p>Micah H. Naftalin, Director of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Councils_for_Soviet_Jews_92fd.html" title="Union of Councils for Soviet Jews">Union of Councils for Soviet Jews</a> said: "Bogus charges aimed at stifling dissent, cruel police tactics, ethnic bias, and blatant disregard for criminal procedural statutes are all on open display. We hope that others will join us in condemning this travesty of justice" <sup id="_ref-Micah_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Micah" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>He explained: "This sentence exposes the underlying hypocrisy of the Russian government's half-hearted struggle against extremist groups and hate speech. This month alone, the FSB refused to investigate the distribution of a neo-Nazi hit list containing the names and addresses of human rights activists whom the authors 'sentenced to death,' a publisher of a newspaper in Ulyanovsk who publicly called for the murder of Jews got a suspended sentence, and three youths who broke the jaw and fractured the skull of the Minister of Culture of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic while screaming racist slogans were sentenced to just six months to a year in prison. You don't have to agree with Mr. Stomakhin's radical, though non-violent, views on Chechnya to see that his sentence was disproportionate and unjust." <sup id="_ref-Micah2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Micah2" title="">[2]</a></sup> No one Jewish NGO in Russian Federation supported his view though.</p>
<p>I agree personally that the statement of Mr. Naftalin concerning the trial of Boris Stomakhin is relevant to the article. But as for his explanations, I would like to stress that they describe not Boris Stomakhin trial, and not the personality of Boris Stomakhin. They may be included in the article dedicated to this organization as it presents their opinion on the political events in Russia or in article dedicated to Politics in Russian Federation.</p>
<p>I completely disagree with user Biophys who deletes the notion of Union of Councils for Soviet Jews as a foreign NGO. The article dedicated to this organization in Wikipedia states that it is based in Washington, DC (and is therefore a foreign NGO) and has office in Russia, apart from offices worldwide. Therefore, the fact of having office in Russia doesn't make it national NGO, for there are tremendous number of organizations like Amnesty International having offices in Russia. But Amnesty International is British NGO, not russian.</p>
<p>Moreover, Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, falsely stated that Boris Stomakhin was probably pushed from the window during the arrest, which I have proved to be false, above. Therefore, their statements couldn't be verified and couldn't be relied upon as truthful.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have deleted the explanations of Mr. Naftalin, because they are irrelevant, not verified, nor reliable.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 16:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1 link to Chechen terrorists website. My attention has caught especially this phrase of Stomakhin which Litvinenko shares and supports and which makes them not dissidents:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Не пацифистские стенания «правозащитников», не уговоры и «переговоры» с палачами и садистами — а только вооруженный удар!" translation "Not pacifist wails of 'human rights activists', not agreements and 'negotiations' with executioners and sadists - but only an armed strike!". If you would cite this phrase, you have to agree that Stomakhin wasn't dissident and politically prosecuted person, he is a criminal who calls for violent change of constitutional regime. And so is Litvinenko who supports Stomakhin claims according to this article. What is more laughable is that Litvinenko citing the above phrase of Stomakhin calls him "political dissident" while calling for violence.</p>
<p>2 links to zaborisa.narod.ru. Narod.ru is the domain for personal pages of users of yandex.ru portal. Here we definitly know that there is no editorial review, unlike at the Revolutionary Contact Association website where Stomakhin - journalist according to your assertions - published his articles and which is not personal page of search engine users.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>3 Link to 'Boris Stomakhin against nuclear terrorism'. Nevertheless, he considers nuclear strike at Russia as not terrorism but 'natural, legal and justified' without any mercy. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>4 Bukovsky and 'letter' it's not a letter - it is demand, which is clear from the following phrase: "ПОЭТОМУ МЫ ТРЕБУЕМ:ПРЕКРАТИТЬ БРЕДОВО-ПОЛИТИЧЕСКОЕ ДЕЛО ПРОТИВ СТОМАХИНА!" translation "AND THEREFORE WE DEMAND TO STOP THE DELIRIUM-POLITICAL INVESTIGATION AGAINST STOMAKHIN!".

<p>I could not find any links to the alleged Stomakhin publications today. That is exactly what can happen with unreliable sources. Right now, this is a completely different site and address. Now they posted only three articles allegedly written by Stomakhin: <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=33" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=33" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=32" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=35" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=35" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Author of last article (maybe indeed Stomakhin - who knows?) says: "Chechens have every right to bomb anything in Russia" (as in the court sentence) but claims that the bombing in Moscow metro were actually organized by FSB. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 05:18, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not Ok. The version created by user Biophys lacks important facts, it cites third-party blogs (unreliable sources), it contains original research in citations of Stomakhin from court sentence. Biophys also deleted the most serious statements by Stomakhin, leaving his most moderate citations. He also excluded without any grounds the fact that Stomakhin political view is to exterminate all Russians. Excluded many facts such as false facts contained in Statement of Union of Councils of fU Jews. This perversions of the facts and personal edits of Stomakhin's citations by Biophys are intolerable.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, you do not want a compromise. What we have here is not a POV dispute. This is matter of Wikipedia LP policies. I reported this as violation in the living persons biographies noticeboard. Now I must follow this rule: "Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous". I am going to follow this rule until a responsible third party (e.g. one of Wikipedia administrators) intervene and say that he or she wants to be responsible for this article content. But until then, I feel morally responsible for defamation of Boris Stomakhin, because I have created this article. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Biophys just read your own words with attention. <b>It is you who wrote "Last compromise version", not me. It is you who refuses to make compromises</b>. Are you always judging people by yourself? I never rejected compromise based on Wikipedia policies and guidelines. It means:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>no original research (inserting personal comments into Stomakhin citations);</li>
<li>no unreliable sources(inseting information from third-party blogs);</li>
<li>no publishing your unsupported propaganda about Russian government and Russians as an ethnicity;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write propaganda, unsupported statements and your conspiracy theories you adore so much, do not await to be welcome in Wikipedia. Let me point you to things people already told you:</p>

<p>Even now instead of making compromise without distorting real facts, you claim my material to be "unsourced or poorly sourced". Whom you consider yourself? Are you an ultimate source of knowledge of everything? Just look at my unanswered questions on the talk page and in the archive. What you dispute? Is it not you who reinserted material from blog - statement by Committee to Protect Journalists? Is it not you who inserted your personal explanations at Stomakhin citations, hereby violating "no original research" rule. If you would delete this article, I would create it again.

<dd>I am not doing original research anywhere. But citation out of context can be easily used to disinform a reader. One should explain why certain claims by Stomakhin were made (e.g. he wrote this in reply to a murder of a women by Budanov), or explain that Stomakhin claimed Moscow metro was actually bombed by FSB, but he believes that rebeles have every right for doing such terrorist actions "after all that Russia did to them" (clearly, this is his personal opinion that most people including me would not share). That is how such subjects should be described in NPOV Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 01:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't that why you delete my whole translation of following Stomakhin citation
<blockquote>
<p>Supporting fighting Chechnya, uniting publicly with Basaev, openly joining the side of Movsar Baraev at the days of Nord-Ost -- we have crossed the border, behind which any connections break and vanish with the past, with the environment, with people among which you have been born and have been growing-up and lived, trustingly considering yourself a part of this, until on the foreign "enemy" website have read and have seen with own eyes terrifying details of deeds made by these people in neighboring, tiny mountain country. So the Rubicon is crossed, the choice is made, and there is nowhere to retreat - now there is no for us any other family, except for oppressed by our "Empire" peoples, except fighting for liberation from yoke partisans, famous field commanders like Basaev, political parties which put forward demands for monetary compensation of occupation and return of taken away territories</p>
</blockquote>
by replacing it with yours edited and taken out of the conext citation
<blockquote>
<p>*"We do not have any other family in the World except all oppressed nations of "our" Empire, except those who fight for liberation from this Empire as <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamil_Basayev_6be5.html" title="Shamil Basayev">Shamil Basayev</a>."</p>

<dd>No problem. You are welcome to include more citations from the court sentence. You can replace my partial citation with more complete citation. We just have to properly describe the "context" of each Stomakhin claim. So, we need to know the name of an original Stomakhin article for each court citation and compare the texts. Then everything should be fine.

What I have written was based on the missing segment of the corresponding article by Stomakhin. One must explain what the corresponding article was about. Otherwise, the meaning of the small cited segment can be comletely distorted. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 06:34, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Isn't it you who accuses me of citing Stomakhin from allegedly written article by Stomakhin? Where have you got a context? Please make the link to where you got the context, and we will discover it leads to third-party comments of Stomakhin. It is explicitly written in the article that these are citations of Stomakhin taken from the official court sentence. You cannot add anything to the court sentence, you are not researcher and you by doing so violate Wikipedia policy.

<p>Someone have deleted my arguments from this talk page. I would like to repeat one of them. In my opinion, Stomakhin is only a normal "liberal" who likes strong statements - by US standards. He is not even a real "anarchist". I have seen many people in US whose political views were more extreme than views of Stomakhin. All these people are free and promte their views relentlessly. How about <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> who said about Muslim countries: "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war." (but others say something like that about US). Ann Coulter is a famous women, not a prisoner.

<dd>I explained my point above. The <i>texts</i> of citation of alleged Stomakhin paper "Death to Russia" by Sokolov and extremist RKO web site are clearly inconsistent with each other (two first phrases in the continuous citation by Sokolov can not be found in the "complete" text of RKO site). Therefore, I believe both sources are unreliable and this '<i>citation</i> should be excluded from the text of this article, although the reference to "alleged" Stomakhin witings can remain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/o/User_talk%7EBiophys_2fc8.html" title="User talk:Biophys">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Biophys_2462.html" title="Special:Contributions/Biophys">contribs</a>) 15:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Lies, lies, lies. If you will compare texts written at rko.marsho.net and zaborisa.narod.ru, zaborisa.marsho.net of course you will find discrepancies. Since the latter two sites were created when Stomakhin was arrested and it's clearly not Stomakhin who wrote (or edited) the articles on them. But articles at rko.marsho.net are his articles. I again reiterate my point - you have no any reliable evidence sitting in US that the these websites are blogs, that they are run by extremists. By the way, you cite Bonner and Litvinenko and Bukovsky from these same sites and you seem pretty well contented with the source.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not mind including any citations from the court sentence, if the context of these citations is properly explained. But RKO site is not an appropriate source.

<dd>Can you give me an example of me citing THAT in Wikipedia? The reason I cited one citation of Stomakhin is that the citation we discuss had become widely cited, e.g. Izvestia and others. And you cannot tell me RKO is not appropriate cite. You cite Bonner, Litvinenko, Bukovsky from site created in support of Stomakhin when he was arrested. So what's your problem, again? Isn't it strange that you attempted to claim that even article in Izvestia was "falsification"? You already been told on Putin's talk page that your allegations that Putin was involved in killing of Kennedy and Ceasar are not appropriate for Wikipedia. You have to live with your bad taste. Do not await that everyone will tolerate you garbage about conspiracy theories. Looking at your contributions I have to suppose that you have some kind of mania on Russia.

<dd>Probably you have to look at archive page, pal before accusations. Isn't that why you delete my whole translation of following Stomakhin citation
<blockquote>
<p>Supporting fighting Chechnya, uniting publicly with Basaev, openly joining the side of Movsar Baraev at the days of Nord-Ost -- we have crossed the border, behind which any connections break and vanish with the past, with the environment, with people among which you have been born and have been growing-up and lived, trustingly considering yourself a part of this, until on the foreign "enemy" website have read and have seen with own eyes terrifying details of deeds made by these people in neighboring, tiny mountain country. So the Rubicon is crossed, the choice is made, and there is nowhere to retreat - now there is no for us any other family, except for oppressed by our "Empire" peoples, except fighting for liberation from yoke partisans, famous field commanders like Basaev, political parties which put forward demands for monetary compensation of occupation and return of taken away territories</p>

by replacing it with yours edited and taken out of the conext citation

<p>Hello Mikka. You see that Biophys is persistent in his attempts to distort repeatedly this article. He is considering that in 5 days, weeks, months he will revert the article again to satisfy his opinion and tastes. Please consider locking the article or baning Biophys from editing it. Just look at his (Biophys) contributions - I think everything is clear from them. He inserts only sources which defame everything which is Russian, but that's no problem. The problem is that he couldn't understand and is not willing to understand opinion of other people. He's just harassing articles about Russian politics by making reverts, deleting sourced statements like it was in Politkovskaya article, by inserting conspiracy theories in Putin's article, where you could read answers of non-russian users to Biophys on talk page (it's worth reading definitely). Just look at the article on FSB which, thanks to Biophys,contains more than half of the article dedicated to conspiracy theoris, hearsays, convictions and unsupported statements about (on) FSB and just compare with article on CIA. Have you ever seen in this article (CIA article) consipracy theory that CIA was behind September 11th? Serbsky Institute... Litvinenko...

I repeat again, the nationality of Stomakhin reference was written by Biophys. I don't care about it.

<dd>To me, this question is important in two aspects.

Second, this is probably the only case in history (correct me if I am wrong) when a European Jew has been convicted for "hate speech" to protect <b>muslims</b>.

<dd>You are wrong. I have corrected you. Isn't it you who presented Stomakhin case as an example of minorities rights abuse in the Wiki article on 'Human rights in Russia'? Isn't it you who wrote that Stomakhin criticized Russian policy in Chechnya? I thought that Chechens are Muslims, and not followers of Judaism. What is more laughable is that Stomakhin defended Chechens and was characterizing Palestinians as terrorists at the same time, while Chechens consider Palestinians as brothers in arms.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 07:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said already that Novodvorskaya makes idiotic statements containing false facts. Stomakhin is a Jew, there are quite a lot of sources which confirm this fact. The problem is that Stomakhin claims that he is a cosmopolitan, while calling to exterminate all Russians. That why we should delete Novodvorskaya comments from the article. Because she is unreliable source, and her statements may defame Stomakhin.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 07:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Vlad with regard to Jewish origin of Stomakhin and think this should be noted. I also agree with Vlad that some Novodvorskaya statements can be interpreted as defamatory. But it does not matter. I also do not like Stomakhin. What she said - she said (if this is relevant). We only must be sure that she indeed said what we are citing (just as in the case of Stomakhin). So, her citation should come from a place with editorial oversight, such as grani.ru.

<dd>Mikka and Alex, Please note that Stomakhin did not say such stupid thing as "Jesus Christ was crucified not by the Jews, but by Chechens", according to the court statement. To the contrary, that was allegedly said in a pamphlet by Russian Orthodox Church, so Stomakhin cited this statement as an example of state-driven propaganda. You have to check all citations very carefully. Anyway, citation out of context amounts to misrepresentation. For example, you cite: "Bombing in Moscow subway was justified, natural and legal...". But he tells in this article that the bombing was organized by FSB. However, he also said that "Chechens have every right to bomb anything in Russia after all that Russia and Russians did to them". That would be an appropriate citation. And so on. If you allow me, I could try to correct such things, and you then could verify everything. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 22:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, no problems with correcting wrong citations. But the citation itself was actually correct ("Jesus Christ was crucified not by the Jews, but by Chechens"). That was deliberate <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinformation.html" title="Disinformation">disinformation</a>. <b>Let's take a look at another possible disinformation in this article.</b> The text cited by Maksim Sokolov includes the following continuous text (Russian): "Чеченские шахиды взрывают это тупое и бессмысленное российское население не зря... Все равно только зря землю бременят... Убивать, убивать, убивать! Залить кровью всю Россию...". <b>Two first sentences cited by Maksim Sokolov can not be found in article "Death to Russia" allegedly written by Stomakhin.</b> This also looks suspicious for the following reasons. <b>First</b>, RKO web site obviously has no any editorial oversight; they can post absolutely anything. <b>Second</b>, the "articles" in RKO site are <b>not dated</b>. This is serious. Any written production must be dated, even personal letter. Otherwise, it is not admissible. <b>Third</b>, Maksim Sokolov did not say what he had actually cited. He did not tell this is "Death to Russia" or anything else. We compare two dubious texts and can see that, yes, they are different! The citation by Sokolov without any reference to the source is also not admissible. <b>Fourth</b>, journalist Vladimir Abarinov claimed that some texts allegedly written by Stomakhin and used for his conviction actually were not written by him (!). <b>Fifth</b>, article "Death to Russia" was not cited in the court sentence, although they tried to find the most incriminating "evidence". I am not doing any original research here. This is simply an examination of sources. My position is very simple and clear: <b>Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous.</b> (and these are are not simply "controversial" materials; these are mutually <b>contradictory and controversial</b> materials). This is not POV issue. If you think the article is POV, one can cite the Stomakhin's court sentence as many times as necessary (but not out of the context). It is also O'K to represent Sokolov opinion (but without his contradictory citation). It is O'K to provide a link to RKO site, because we are not responsible for content of other sites. This is major problem here. If this can be resolved, then all other POV and OR issues, which are present in this article, can be resolved easily I hope. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

May I remind you about freedom of speech? Journalists cannot be forced to name their sources. Newspaper is liable in case statements published by it are libelous. No one single person has ever sued Izvestia newspaper for defaming of Stomakhin. Stomakhin has the right to sue them, but he didn't while he had an opportunity in the court. If you think you are right, then go to the court and beat them. Don't whine in Wikipedia, if you think that you are right. What is more laughable is that all the human rights activists and human rights NGO never tried to sue Izvestia and this fact means more than the original research by Biophys. I understand your desire to name Maksim Sokolov article forgery, falsification, libel because it undermines your self-nurtured image of Stomakhin as 'a peaceful dissident', but your desire is an original research. You could only site from sources here in Wikipedia. Newspaper Izvestia is a well-known source in the world of mass media. Your attempts to find libels in Izvestia by comparing it with not well-known sources (even RCA web-site) is pathetic, really.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 11:34, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is all irrelevant.

We are not judges or investigators, and this is not court. We only suppose to examine the existing sources to see if they met Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable source</a> criteria, and I did exactly that.

<p>Stomakin's main idea is that contemporary Russia is a totalitarian state like Nazi Germany, and therefore the military resistance and terrorism (like "partisans" in Belorussia) are appropriate.

<dd>The latter is quite clear from opinions of others expressed in the "Commentaries" section. You cannot ctate his "main idea" by yourself.

<dd>Of course, I strongly agree. Please, no original research here! But let's take a look. This article says that Stomakhin "called to exterminate all Russians". Strong statement, is not it?

<p>What's your problem, boy? Are you so intellectual as not to get that the article 'Death to Russia' you talk so much about was written after investigation was held? But I already know that you are not lawyer, so you 'encyclopedic' discourse about legal matters looks awesome. I already told twice, thrice and would tell it as many times as you would like, I took one phrase from the article of Maksim Sokolov, and another from the original article of Stomakhin. All citations are referenced and sourced. If you have <b>evidence</b> of Wikipedia'a policies violation, please, do not hesitate to present it to us as soon as possible. We would be the first people to prosecute violations of policies. But so far, applying you self-made and self-proclaimed criteria of 'controversity', I see that majority your edits in Stomakhin, human rights and russian articles should be deleted.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is obvious that two cited texts of the same article are different. It means that one of them or both are forgery. What else <b>evidence</b> do you need? All my other arguments are also valid. Of course, this is a clear violation of stated Wikipedia policies. That is why I reported it. You claim that "the article 'Death to Russia' you talk so much about was written after investigation was held". But how can we know this? The "article" at the RKO site was not even dated! What kind of "source" is that? Even blogs are usually dated. This "source" is worse than a blog. I emphasize: this is a <i>continuous</i> citation in Maksim Sokolov article (a continuous text between two " signs: "..."). I said: this is not original research, but only a simple examination of mutually contradictory sources. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not obvious. I am not citing citations from the same texts, however all the citations I cite from the article 'Death to Russia' are found in the original article at <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The first phrase beginning with 'Kill, Kill, Kill!' is taken from Sokolov's article. Sokolov's article doesn't suggest continuous citation from the same source. It's a matter of your interpretation which is original research, forbidden here. Second citation, beginning with 'Russians should be killed' is taken from the Stomakhin article <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<p>Hard evidence that Sokolov's article or Stomakhin's article contains information that is false in regard of Stomakhin. All phrases from Sokolov's article are taken from the numerous articles of Stomakhin found at <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://rko.marsho.net/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. It is you who began to compare the real articles of Stomakhin found at <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://rko.marsho.net/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> with the articles found at <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and <a href="http://zaborisa.narod.ru" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.narod.ru" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. It is understood by every sane person that these sites were created by supporters of Stomakhin when Stomakhin was in jail. Therefore it couldn't be Stomakhin who wrote the articles on these later two sites. Moreover, these sites claim that Stomakhin was 'pushed from the window' even now although Stomakhin advocate told in an interview that he had done so himself. So your attempts to compare valid sources with the material published on disinformation websites <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://zaborisa.narod.ru" class="external autonumber" title="http://zaborisa.narod.ru" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> is very pathetic. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 06:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. My mistake. But this article will probably be deleted. Next time I will make it right. But I did not write much about Putin, because Putin is unimportant. He is not Stalin.

<p>Therefore, according to your logic, you also wish another people to die. What's your problem? Why you await respect from other people, if you disrespect them? You have wrote tremendous number which is offensive in regard of Russia and Russians. You falsify information and publish hearsays and unsupported conspiracy theories in Wikipedia which are offensive on Russia. Why you extort me to be respectful of yours? Putin cannot defend himself here in Wikipedia, where such liars like you wish him to die. You also have lied that Putin is unimportant for you, because you have made a great number of edits in the article on Putin and have always provided convictions of Putin in Politkovskaya and Litvinenko articles. You are liar, that's it.213.184.225.28 11:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are a few statements in the article like "No Jewish organization in Russia supported..." "No human rights organization presented ..." etc. These are very strong statements. Do you really know in details all the decision of Jewish (or HR) Organizations? There are many of them; it is quite possible that the Jews of some Vasyuki town decided to support Stomakhin but we just do not know about it. On another levels these statements that something has not happened are intended to be arguments supporting a point of view. As such they should be attributed to somebody (or go to the talk if it is our invention).

<p>Ok, but no one human rights organization or jewish ngo supported Stomakhin at trial - we know it from the court documents. They just blow out bla-bla-bla and cowardly sit in the bush.

<p>It is very clear (see my arguments above) that Sokolov's citation of Stomakhin and the "articles" from RKO web site do not satisfy formal Wikipedia criteria of reliable sources. So, <b>I am going to follow exactly Wikipedia rules</b> and revert any versions where this citation would appear (or any other versions with clear violations of Wikipedia LP policies). 3RR rule does not apply. Please understand. I do not like Stomakhin. If I only knew about such infighting and waist of time, I would have never created this article about him. But since this article has been already created by me, I feel responsible for having such version that does not defame a living person by using controversial and contradictory sources.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alex and Mikka, you know that I am <i>formally</i> right about these poor sources, just as you are probably <i>formally</i> right about the La Russophobe. After all these lies and personal offences by Vlad, I really do not want to write about any controversial topics, such as "La Russophobe", "FSB brigades in the Internet" <a href="http://gulag.ipvnews.org/article20060916_01.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://gulag.ipvnews.org/article20060916_01.php" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> (I hope they do not work in Wikipedia), "Accusations of Vladimir Putin" (there is such article in Russian Wikipedia), or other people like Stomakhin. But this article about Stomakhin must be fair, NPOV, and follow all Wikipedia policies for the reasons explained above. Then, I would rather do something for Biology or on other non-controversial subjects.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Stomakhin called to overthrow violently current government of Russian Federation.</li>

<p>This is supported again by the citation from the court sentence that is already present in the article: "We, 'Revolutionary Contact Association' and 'Radical Politics' are united with the Committee and are ready to cooperate with it. It is understood that we [are] a lot more radical than it. We are for not waiting until 2008 and we shouldn't bother ourselves particularly with Constitution, but we are for calling people to overthrow and liquidate Putin's regime as soon as possible. And we at all do not see possibility of preserving of present Russian Federation as a single state. But we are for common front with all our allies, even more moderate".[2] Citation from the court sentence which clearly supports the above phrase: <b>Таким образом Стомахин Б.В. являясь членом РКО, осознанно действуя в интересах данного объединения, планировал и призывал совершать действия, запрещенные Федеральным Законом № 114-ФЗ от 25.07.2002 года "О противодействии экстремистской деятельности" и являющиеся экстремистскими, а именно: насильственное изменение основ конституционного строя и нарушения целостности Российской Федерации;</b></p>
<ul>

<p>This is supported by the court sentence again <b>Таким образом Стомахин Б.В. являясь членом РКО, осознанно действуя в интересах данного объединения, планировал и призывал совершать действия, запрещенные Федеральным Законом № 114-ФЗ от 25.07.2002 года "О противодействии экстремистской деятельности" и являющиеся экстремистскими... обращался к гражданам и организациям лично и через издаваемый им бюллетень "Радикальная политика", обладающий в соответствии с Законом всеми признаками экстремистских материалов, как документы и иная информация на иных носителях, предназначенные для обнародования и призывающие к осуществлению экстремисткой деятельности, обосновывающие и оправдывающие необходимость осуществления такой деятельности, обосновывающие и оправдывающие национальное и (или) расовое превосходство и оправдывающие практику совершения военных и иных преступлений,</b> направленных на полное или частичное уничтожение какой-либо этнической, социальной, расовой, национальной или религиозной группы (статья 1 Закона). Also it is supported by citation from Stomakhin itself <b><i>Kill, Kill, Kill!

<p>Moreover, we should add from the court sentence that Stomakhin <b>Стомахин Б.В., в своем информационном бюллетене "Радикальная политика" №1 (27) за январь 2003 года и № 9 (35) за 2003 года указал на неполноценность православного народа, передав изложенными им словесными оборотами о православии оскорбительные характеристики и отрицательные эмоциональные оценки верующих, выражения дискриминационного отношения к православию, как религии, отмечая о необходимости ликвидации таковой веры, исповедуемой русским народом, унижая, тем самым национальное достоинство граждан, исповедующих данную веру.</b> Since it is also supported by Regnum news agency <b>Автор также призывал не признавать православие.</b><a href="http://www.regnum.ru/news/742301.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.regnum.ru/news/742301.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>

<dd>In my opinion, any <b>dated</b> materials on the Russian-language site <a href="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zaborisa.narod.ru/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (but not on RKO site!) can be used (unless this is a secondary reference to a poor source, such as blogs and wikis). The court sentence was taken from there, and there are other materials. Many of your qquestions have been already disscused and explained (so we are not going to repeat). It is important that the court sentence and proceedings were disputed by Stomakhin's lawyer and human rights organizations. Therefore, we should refer to the court's accuations only as court accusations (as we did in the part about the court). The political views of Stomakhin (he compared Putin with Saddam Hussein, etc.) should be described exactly as in non-controversial journal publications, but not as in the court sentence (the court accusations and conviction are described below and separately as such). If you find anything clearly and directly stated in the good journal publications about political views of Stomakhin, that would be appropriate to include in the beginning of the article. Please tell, what of this kind is missing.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 06:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alex, thank you for the intervention. But you almost restored the old version by Vlad. Everyone can compare and see it. Yes, I am ready to find some kind of a compromise. For example, we can prominently represent the Sokolov's opinion. The only thing we can not compromise is defamation of a living person using controversial sources. So, I will do some editing of your version (probably today or tomorrow) to show what compromise is appropriate in my view. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC). There are two main points of contention here. First, no source (including court sentence and Maksim Sokolov) says literally that "Stomakhin wanted to exterminate Russians". This is OR based on unreliable sources. Court sentence claims that Stomakhin "advocated violence against Russian people". This can be said, but it is not the same. Second, based on my arguments above, article "Death to Russia" at the RKO web site can not be considered as a reliable source, and therefore it can not be directly cited for the purpose of defamation. This is "alleged article" at best, and it can be mentioned as such and remain in the list of references if you insist. Right now, the entire "case" against Stomakhin in this article is built on citation of this unreliable (at best source). It was cited 5 times. This must be corrected. Other disagreements seem to be relatively minor, but they should be fixed to have NPOV article.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:34, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>See this paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"According to his court sentence Stomakhin in his articles advocated terrorist attacks on Russian civilians[1], called to overthrow violently current government of Russian Federation[1], called to exterminate all Russians[1], Stomakhin claimed that modern Russia is Evil empire and therefore must be destroyed, called Russians a "nation of occupiers", and compared President Vladimir Putin to Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic.[2] Stomakhin considered terrorists Shamil Basaev and Salman Raduev as heroes of Chechen resistance and claimed that terrorist acts committed by them are legitimate [3]. On the other hand, opposition and some human rights activists like Valeria Novodvorskaya and Yakov Krotov interpreted his writings as a graphic description of the possible feelings of Chechen people rather than the actual advocating of the terrorist activities [4]"</p>
<p>First, the opinions of Valeria Novodvorskaya and Yakov Krotov are completely irrelevant here. We have a separate chapter about "opinions". Second, court sentence is also irrelevant; we have a separate chaper about the court. One should put it there (but it is already there! However, this is not a major point, so we can leave it there, and just make a little bit shorter. Reference [3] is also court decision. Third, court sentence does not say all things covered by reference [1] which is not court decision. What we have here is only reference [2] (could be more of course, but not "Death to Russia", which can be mentioned with regard to Maksim Sokolov opinion (<b>if you insist that he had in mind this alleged and not named article, although actually he cited something else!</b>). <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:08, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Opinions of Novodvorskaya and Krotov here refer and concern the views of Stomakhin and not his trial - it is evident just from reading it. That perfectly justifies their citations. Biophys, the court sentence gives an estimate of Stomakhin views. We no longer need to site some special sources. The court sentence is a valid source according to Wikipedia rules. And, Oh I forgot, it is also dated as specifically required by you.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 05:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My position is not to include this material at all as unreliable (at best), plain and simple. You think it should be included. Now, I will take for a minute your position and show what kind of trouble it is. According to Vlad (see above), this article was published after the conviction, and therefore it has not been cited in the court sentence. Fine, maybe he is right, although we do not know for sure, since this text was not dated. So, <b>Sokolov is trying to justify Stomakhin's conviction based on something that Stomakhin did already after this conviction?</b>. This is nonsense. But maybe that was the reason why Sokolov did not indicated his source? I have no idea. This is mess. That is exactly why we should not use unreliable sources. But most important, <b>the text cited by Sokolov is different from the text on RKO site. So, we do not know what is that he had cited and even Sokolov himself did tell in his article what it that he is citing</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 00:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, I simply noted that the source of the text was not identified by Sokolov (and in fact it is inconsistent with the text in alleged article "Death to Russia"), and I briefly summarized the essence of this article. <b>Obviously, the most important thing is announcement of nuclear war to Russian Federation by author of this article.

<dd>Now, I finally realized why did Sokolov inserted these two phrases! The text of alleged article "Death to Russia" was so increadibly stupid that author did not even tell who should attack Russia.

Yes, we argued, but it was possible to find a common ground with everyone but you. This article is NPOV now. The political views of Stomakhin are very clear from the court sentence citations. But you want to paint him as a <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a> <b>using single unreliable citation.</b> Why? Do you hate him so much?

He said: "I suggest a way forward: for all Russian sources you want to reference, starting with the first, you get agreement on the talk page that the source is (a) reliable and (b) that the translation (of the relevant passages, not the whole thing) is agreed." O'K. I think we disagree only about one source: article "Death to Russia" and especially its citation (not dated, RKO site has no editorial oversight, and the unsourced citation by Sokolov contradicts to the alleged source). So, we have to resolve this question first. Until this is resolved, we can not move forward. I have made a compromise in the previous version: we do not cite this text directly (because two alleged texts contradict each other) but describe the content of this citation by Sokolov in general terms (although, strictly speaking, this contradicts Wikipedia LP policy).

If administrators would rule out its reliability, then we should preserve it. It's not a matter which should be decided by just two people. If non-Russian speakers want to translate the article at independent translators - they always could do it at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslators_available_0155.html#Russian-to-English" title="Wikipedia:Translators available">Wikipedia:Translators available#Russian-to-English</a>. By the way, applying your criteria also renders citations of Bukovsky, Bonner which are taken from personal pages domen zaborisa.narod.ru, unreliable too. Citation of Stomakhin from Izvestia article and namely "Kill, Kill, Kill! To flood all Russia with blood, to not give a quarter to anyone, to try to make at least one atomic explosion on the territory of Russian Federation -- this is like the program of radical Resistance should be, and Russian's, and Chechen's, and anyone's! Let the Russians, according to their deserts, reap as they has sown", couldn't be scrapped, since it is one of the most respectable newspapers in Russia.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 17:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Sokolov implies a direct citation from a single source. The reason Vlad omitted these three phrases is very simple: they probably (but we do not know for sure!) were doctored (invented) by Sokolov. That was not interview. There is no any reference where it came from whatsoever. He simply stated: Stomakhin claimed that: "..." He did not tell: this is article "Death to Russia". <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:19, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you blame that journalist falsified citations? It is laughable, since everyone could find Stomakhin's articles on Revolutionary Contact Association website which is maintained by the same people who run zaborisa.marsho.net and its mirror site zaborisa.narod.ru. So you claim that collegues of Boris Stomakhin also doctored (invented) the same versions of Boris Stomakhin articles which match those citations in Izvestia article? There is no any controversy! It is only Biophys who disputes both texts published at RCA website and Izvestia article, which correspond each other.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The author in question discusses the nature of article 282 of Russian Criminal Code, he covers judophobes, kavkazophobes and their statements that are usually disguised as euphemisms. He says even the phrase 'final settlement of jewish question' is euphemism. Then he says: "But Stomakhin elected explicit manner:"Chechen <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahid.html" title="Shahid">Shahids</a> blow up this blockheaded and unitelligent (variant-senseless) Russian population not without reason... They just burden the Earth...Kill, Kill, Kill!

Let the Russians, according to their deserts, reap as they has sown...". The next sentence, journalist says: "Compared with this, Mein Kampf is a textbook on humanism". Then journalist says that if this article to be applied at all, then it should be applied to the absolute champion (Stomakhin - accroding to journalist).<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't cite these phrases in the article on Stomakhin, but nevertheless... Well, let us see the RKO website (Russian) where the last sentences are found "Чеченские шахиды взрывают это тупое и бессмысленное российское население не зря... Все равно только зря землю бременят...". These sentences could be found in another article of Stomakhin "Tushino, Budennovsk, Nord Ost and so on.." here at <a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" class="external free" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm</a>. And citations from Sokolov article and original article of Stomakhin match again. Again, I repeat Izvestia article by Maksim Sokolov in no way implies continous citation from one text. By researching <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a> article, you do original research and convict this respectable Media of libel. The phrase about stinking Russia could be found in both the Official court sentence and Official conviction.

<dd>I am not talking about Izvestia at all. I am talking about this citation by Sokolov. It was taken from another unreliable and not identified by Sokolov source (probably RKO site). He also made a composition from three different articles/sources but misrepresented this as a single continuous citation. We do not want such citations in Wikipedia. Sokolov discloses his "source": Stomakhin (this is not a case with protecting an anonymous witness). Of course, he does it! The entire article by Sokolov is clearly a defamation of a dissident ordered by government (there are numerous cases like that in Soviet history). But this is not my argument at the moment. The argument is poor source - RKO site. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:03, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(I don’t know how the Russian system works.) —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 20:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then fine, let's use more reliable Russian sources, such as printed or Internet newspapers with editorial oversight. Strictly speaking, you are right, and 'For Boris' is a private group site. So, let's exclude it. No problem. But I do not know any other reliable source where the text of the court sentence can be found. If Vlad finds one, we can use it. If we want to eliminate all texts with the references to 'Pro Boris' site, I would try to find some alternative good references, and if they are not found, just remove the unreferenced portions of text. So, let's decide: do we want to do it? If we do, Vlad will need some time to find an alternative source with the court sentence. If he does not, we will have to delete all references to the court, except those mentioned or cited in reliable secondary publications. So, are we going to do this? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 21:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I just looked at a couple of possible Russian sources. A question: if the Russian newspaper article is dated but not signed by anyone - is it a reliable source? I guess it is not. However, the official statements by organizations are not necessarily signed by its Director, which is O'K.

<dd>Let's agree first that we do not use RKO site and citation by Sokolov taken from several different articles of RKO site. Of course, we can describe opinion of Sokolov based on his article in Izvestia. But we do not cite directly the alleged article "Death to Russia" from anywhere, because its primary source is RKO site.

If we agree not to use this source, we can move forward. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 01:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Biophys disputes the phrases not contained in the article on Boris Stomakhin, and namely the phrases about Shahids and about stinky Russia.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes these phrases by comparing them to the source he claims to be unreliable (RKO website).</li>
<li>one disputed phrase (about Shahids) is contained also at RKO website and match perfectly to that cited by Journalist.</li>
<li>Some words from the second disputed phrase (stinky Russia) are contained in both the Official court sentence and conviction.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes here only RKO website, which is not relevant to the dispute right now, because we discuss only Izvestia article.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes these phrases based on the logic that 'they were probably taken by Maksim Sokolov' from RKO website. But he couldn't know actually.</li>
<li>Biophys logic is that all Stomakhin citations should be contained on the RKO website, although we know that there are newspaper 'Radikalnaya Politika' edited by Boris Stomakhin and there are publications of other radicals which could have published citation of Stomakhin in question. I don't understand why Biophys think that all Stomakhin citations should be contained only at RKO website.</li>
<li>Biophys failed to show that there are contradictory phrases. Out of three citation by Maksim Sokolov, two are found at the RKO website<a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" rel="nofollow">1 citation at RKO website</a><a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">2 citation at RKO website</a> and they perfectly match those of the Journalist and one (about 'Stinky Russia') is not found, because Journalist haven't provided sources. The impossibility to found right now missing citation is not contradiction to Izvestia article. The fact that this citation couldn't be found does not mean contradiction.</li>
<li>The phrase 'worse than blog' is absolutely incorrect in regard of RKO website, since Biophys doesn't have evidence that this site has no any review, Biophys has no information on who runs the website.</li>
<li>Journalists have the privilege not to disclose their sources, in order to provide the freedom of speech.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>And now the basic question: where is the controversy? If Biophys claims RKO website is unreliable, then how he uses this website in order to validate Journalist citations?</b> <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 03:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another potentially unreliable source I want to ask about is Russian newspaper "Utro" that includes an unsigned but dated article (this is not an editorial article). This article allege that Stomakhin helped materially Chechen terrorists who took hostages, based on information provided by <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_%28Russia%29_f093.html" title="FSB (Russia)">FSB</a>. That would be a charge in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> rather than <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>.

<p>I think a claim that someone is <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> (although the person was never even charged of this terrible crime in the court) is an "exceptional claim".

<p>If I may offer a third opinion, Utro does not seem to be a reliable source for anything. (This is my impression from looking at their website.)

<dd>Just tell us why Utro doesn't seem to be a reliable source for anything, because I may label anything I don't like personally unreliable. The 'yellow press' is as liable for their statements as common press. See the UK news on 'The Mirror' and the likes. It is mass media. There is no any specific status for yellow press in Wikipedia policies. Moreover, yellow press sometimes does prominent job by uncovering hidden matters such as Doctor Kelly's death connected with Iraq Dossier. So far except your general label 'yellow press', I see nothing else. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 14:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vlad has added two(?) citations of content on the SOVA Centre website, sova-center.ru. However, according to the cited pages, both are copied from other websites. The ‘sentence’ document is from <a href="http://www.hro.org/editions/freedom/2006/11/28.php" class="external free" title="http://www.hro.org/editions/freedom/2006/11/28.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hro.org/editions/freedom/2006/11/28.php</a>; hro.org seems to be against the verdict against Stomakhin but not really in favour of his work (which is an improvement from the previous source for the document). The ‘conviction’ (indictment?) document is from <a href="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=26" class="external free" title="http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=26" rel="nofollow">http://zaborisa.marsho.net/?pg=7&amp;item=26</a>, which does not seem reliable.

I do think that material on narod.ru (a free web hosting site without any editorial oversight) and marsho.net (an extremist website) should not be cited except <i>maybe</i> to reference Stomakhin’s own writings on marsho.net, if there is consensus that this is possible (and necessary). —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 22:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vlad demands an explanation why I am reverting his changes. Here it is. I think he violates LP and other Wikipedia policies simultaneously at three levels.</p>
<p>1. <b>Unreliable sources.</b> The citation in Sokolov's paper comes from RKO site, which is unreliable source because it has no editorial oversight, it is a private site run by a small group of people, and the articles are not even dated (worse than blog where all correspondence is usually dated).</p>
<p>2. <b>Some sources are not neutral.</b> Vlad and Alex Bakharev claimed that <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a> is a "neutral respectable newspaper". But it is not. This newspaper is governmental property. It was purchased by state-owned <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazprom.html" title="Gazprom">Gazprom</a>, see <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>. The article by Maksim Sokolov is obviously a defamation, because Sokolov compares Stomakhin with <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and says that Stomakhin is worse than Adolf Hitler. Same thing with the unsigned article by Utro, which is a newspaper of Russian nationalists. As I said, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> is an exceptional claim that must be supported by multiple sources. Citing "Utro" and Maksim Sokolov may be compared with citing someone like <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> (I said: "Goebbels" because Sokolov compared Stomakhin with Hitler). But citing <a href="../../../a/r/t/ARTICLE_19_bcd8.html" title="ARTICLE 19">ARTICLE 19</a> or <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Bukovsky_0c6a.html" title="Vladimir Bukovsky">Vladimir Bukovsky</a> is something very different and appropriate for this case. The proceeding of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_court.html" title="Kangaroo court">Kangaroo court</a> in Moscow is also not a neutral source.</p>
<p>3. <b>Non-encyclopedic style.</b> "Kill, kill, kill!" is not for Wikipedia. Many groups or people advocate war, including even American <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatives.html" title="Neoconservatives">neoconservatives</a>. Their views can be easily described (and actually described in Wikipedia) in general words, without any propaganda or defamation.</p>
<p><b>I compromised on almost everything here.</b> We included allegations by "Utro" (now I can see - that was wrong). We included allegations by court. We included allegations by Maksim Sokolov. My last version was like that:</p>
<p>Sokolov <i>"cited a text allegedly written by Boris Stomakhin, which claimed that "Russian Federation must be destroyed" using all available violent means including nuclear weapons, because all Russians are collectively responsible for actions of their state with respect to Chechen people.'</i></p>
<p><b>What else do you want?</b> <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> also found that Vlad violates LP policies,even without looking at the original Russian texts and blocked temporarily his access to this article, which was evaded by Vlad.

<p>All the arguments of Biophys above do not concern defamation or contradiction, and concern subjective issues such as "unreliable", "unencyclopedic", "neutrality". Given Biophys history of contributions we could see that Biophys had created such contributions as Putin in the article 'Phallus', blog La Russophobe. It is very naive to give Biophys any credibility for his judgement on "neutrality". All these problems - "unreliable", "unencyclopedic", "neutrality" - could be eliminated by presenting other POVs, refining wording in the article. As for reliability, statements from NGO and human rights activists indict Russian Government of violation of human rights and do not contain any evidence or details, no addresses, no witnesses, no specific events. These materials are also defamatory, since all these organizations have access to European Human Rights Court, to any court at Russian Federation to brought their charges, but they do not brought them, firing bla-bla-bla at Russian Federation instead. Moreover, I have shown by comparing to other sources that statement of Union of Councils for Soviet Jews contains facts (Stomakhin was pushed from the window)that directly contradict to the interview of Stomakhin attorney and numerous press articles. Therefore they lie. But nevertheless I kept their statements.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Neutrality is eliminated by presenting other POV, which is done prominently. You consider it is encyclopedic to believe in all your guesses and conspiracy theories?

*Sources which aquit Stomakhin can't be called neutral too, since statements from NGO and activists 
who supported Stomakhin turned out to be false. For example Statement by Jewish Union that Stomakhin  
was pushed from the window.
*Of course judging if the source is neutral should be exclusive comepetnce of Biophys and no one 
else.
*Not-neutral sources are balanced by presenting other POV. It is Wikipedia.

<li>Biophys disputes the phrases not contained in the Wiki article on Boris Stomakhin, and namely the phrases about Shahids and about stinky Russia.</li>
<li>Biophys disputes these phrases by comparing them to the source he claims to be unreliable (RKO website).</li>

<li>Biophys disputes these phrases based on the logic that 'they were probably taken by Maksim Sokolov' from RKO website. But he couldn't know actually.</li>
<li>Biophys logic is that all Stomakhin citations should be contained on the RKO website, although we know that there are newspaper 'Radikalnaya Politika' edited by Boris Stomakhin and there are publications of other radicals which could have published citation of Stomakhin in question. I don't understand why Biophys think that all Stomakhin citations should be contained only at RKO website.</li>
<li>Biophys failed to show that there are contradictory phrases. Out of three citation by Maksim Sokolov, two are found at the RKO website<a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/tushino.htm" rel="nofollow">1 citation at RKO website</a><a href="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" class="external text" title="http://rko.marsho.net/articl/mashadov.htm" rel="nofollow">2 citation at RKO website</a> and they perfectly match those of the Journalist and one (about 'Stinky Russia') is not found, because Journalist haven't provided sources. The impossibility to found right now missing citation is not contradiction to Izvestia article. The fact that this citation couldn't be found does not mean contradiction.</li>
<li>The phrase 'worse than blog' is absolutely incorrect in regard of RKO website, since Biophys doesn't have evidence that this site has no any review, Biophys has no information on who runs the website.</li>
<li>Journalists have the privilege not to disclose their sources, in order to provide the freedom of speech.</li>

The citation was done like that: "text...text". So, the Sokolov's citation 
is a "secondary citation" of a single "primary source" (RKO web site), 
but this primary source is unreliable according to Wikipedia criteria.

<dd>Biophys, please stop reverting edits in bulk. If you disagree with some references, remove the corresponding passages, but don't revert the whole addition just like that, it's extremely annoying.

<dd>Our main disagreement with Vlad is about citing RKO site. If he agrees about that, we can move forward and discuss any other changes he wants. Let's do one thing at a time, and start from the most important point of contention. The problem is: he inserted a lot of other things that are POV and violate LP policy. We can discuss all of that, but let's do it step by step. As a gesture of good will, I agree to improve the reliability of the existing "pro" sources (this needs some time) and represent and explain Sokolov opinion more prominently. But this should be done starting from the existing version that does not violates LP policy. I will do it. So, Vlad, do you agree not to cite the RKO site through Sokolov or otherwise? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 15:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree that's the main disagreement. However, Izvestia and court sentence, are perfectly reliable sources and should be kept. Whether the sentence is "fair", "kangoroo" or whatever is another matter, and kinda out of place on WP: if you someone is sentenced to prison for X or Y, it should be mentionned.

<dd>As I explained (see LP violations above), <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a> and Maksim Sokolov is not a neutral source and therefore can be challenged. But I am ready for compromise. During the previous discussion mediated by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William M. Connolley</a> (thanks to him!), we found that a continuous citation from the article of Sokolov comes from three different sources, at least two of which are RKO site. Actually, the person who found it was Vlad. At least the fragments of texts are identical (Sokolov did not tell where his citation came from). Thus, it originates from an unreliable primary source. Therefore, my position is the following: describe the opinion of Sokolov (why not?) but do not cite directly the unreliable source. I also can agree that citing court sentence is appropriate because it comes from Russian language sources that seem to be sufficiently reliable although perhaps not neutral. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 15:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ellol, actually this segment is about <b>notability</b>, as suppose to be in the Introduction of any biography. Stomakhin is notable for two reasons. 1. He openly objected Russian operations in Chechnya. There are only two other such journalists in Russia known to the West: Dmitrievsky and Anna Politkovskaya. Anna is dead and Dmitrievskii is also convicted for "hate speech" (but not in prison yet). That is notable and should be mentioned in the article. 2. Stomakhin is probably the only journalist in Russia currently in prison for alleged hate speech (there is another journalist listed by CPJ, but I do not know why he was convicted). That is also notable. If you can suggest how this could be formulated better, we can discuss it.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds too complicated. We need something very clear and simple for the initial abstract. The reference to criminal code "Articles 280 (Public Appeals for a Forcible Change of the Constitutional System of the Russian Federation) and 282 (Incitement of National, Racial, or Religious Enmity)" does not work here. Honestly, since the article is locked, can we just relax a little and do something more useful? This Stomakhin does not deserve so much of our nerves and attention. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 04:11, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Biophys, we have to reach consensus. 2) It's not right to say he was accused for hate speech. He was accused for <b>both</b> hate speech and appealing for a forcible change of Russia's Constitutional System. Both articles are comparably heavy. Saying he was accused for hate speech is semi-truth and misleading our readers. 1) You say "He openly objected Russian operations in Chechnya." It's a true statement but it doesn't reflect level of his radicalism.</p>
<p>I suggest to write, "He supports Chechen separatists and advocates extermination of Russia and Russians as a nation. In 2006 he was sentenced to five years for hate speech and appeals for forcible change of Russia's Constitutional System."</p>

<p><b>Strongly disagree</b> for several reasons. <b>First</b>, this is OR and total distortion. None of the references including court sentence and even Maksim Sokolov says that he wanted "to exterminate Russians as nation." <b>Second</b>, this contradicts assessments of all human rights activists and organizations. <b>Third</b>, this initial "Abstract" of biography should be about notability of the person (as usual). What you suggest is defamation, worse than that proposed by Vlad.

<p>You have protected version of Biophys. And it is discrimination of me. Biophys was deleteing and reverting versions done not only by me, but by administrators Mikkalai, Alex Bakharev. So it just simply protection of Biophys version. I oppose that kind of thing. I would like to ask Alex Bakharev or Mikkalai to revert the article back to their version. Now the article contains only Biophys citations. Biophys failed to prove the contradiction - which was the main point of his argumentation. Biophys lied intentionally about contradictions. And Biophys deleted the material which he called "contradictory". Biophys believes that there is a plot (conspiracy) by Russian government against <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremist.html" title="Extremist">extremist</a> Stomakhin sentenced for <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremism</a>. And Biophys tries to delete from the article on Stomakhin all information that could doubt this thought. My citations prove that Stomakhin actually wasn't dissident since he called for violence, called terrorist attacks legitimate and called Chechen terrorists heroes. He wants now to delete these supported by sources phrases from the article on Stomakhin by claiming they are unreliable. But these phrases are supported not only by the official court sentence.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we want to agree about anything, let's agree about certain rules for discussion. If these rules contradict any stated Wikipedia policies, please tell and let's discuss the rules first.</p>
<p>Rule 1. Do not breake to parts and modify comments of each other.</p>
<p>Rule 2. The currently protected version of the article serves as a basis for further changes (improvements).</p>
<p>Rule 3. We consider one change at a time.</p>
<p>Rule 4. Other side has 48 hours to answer (I suppose we all busy at work).</p>
<p>Rule 5. All sides including Vlad and me must agree to make this particular change.</p>
<p>Rule 6. Since we have serious disagreements, let's start from things that are obviously wrong (from your or Vlad point of view in the current version).</p>
<p>7. (not a rule). Let's have 3-day cooling off period.</p>
<p>If you and Vlad agree, we can start this work. If not, this will be waist of time.</p>
<p>Now about your suggestion. This segment tells: "He was one of a few journalists in Russia who openly challenged policies of Putin's administration with respect to Chechnya. He was imprisoned for allegedly advocating violent resistance to Russian military operations in Chechnya."</p>
<p>Obviously, Stomakhin was against policies of Putin's administration in Chechnya. Obviuosly, he was imprisoned. Obviously, he was accused in advocating violent resistance to Russian military operations in Chechnya, as follows from the text of this article. So, may be we should start from something that is really wrong (Rule 6)?<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 00:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) Notability. The problem is you consider notability from POV of a theory that fair journalists are prosecuted in Russia and Putin's regime violently treats its opponents. But there is also other theory that Russia is democracy and its media are free. Our task is not to seek arguments in favour of these theories. Not in Wikipedia. Not for the expense of Wikipedia. Our task is to describe <b>facts</b>. What were Stomakhin views/works about. Why was he prosecuted. It's enough for introduction. Agree?</p>
<p>2) I suggest replacement for <i>imprisoned for allegedly advocating violent resistance to Russian military operations in Chechnya</i>: "In 2006 he was sentenced to five years for incitement of national, racial, or religious enmity and appeals for forcible change of Russia's constitutional system." This is <b>exactly</b> the court sentence, i.e. articles 280 and 282 <a href="http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter29.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter29.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> and may be linked to it. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 02:14, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a> that last phrase in Introduction is not clear.

<dd>Ellol, I can discuss anything with you. However this does not make any sense in the presence of Vlad. Maybe you have a lot of free time, but I am really busy with other things. Please take a look at the Talk:Boris Stomakhin, including Archieve. This is all my discussion with Vlad - many hundreds of edits. Please also take a look at the living persons notice board.

<p>Biophys. We need agreement of all. But reasonable agreement or disagreement. Not just "I will not let you edit this article coz I don't want you to". It's how I understand this.</p>
<p>I'll explain my position again. Of course, simply "hate speech" is incorrect. He was imprisoned for appeals for downthrodding constitutional order, too. But if we want to put it in two words, hate speech is enough, imho. Coz in wide sense it's hate towards the state, too. Later in this article reader will find more thorough info.</p>

<p>Disagree. We must tell here briefly about his notability, as in biography of any other living person. This is reasonable. The already existing text or new text that I have suggested serve much better this purpose. Two sentences are O'K.

<dd>Ellol, I don't have serious objections over your wording, but the matter is that Biophys was lucky that his version was blocked and now he will try all his best in order to undermine reaching any consensus. In fact he's pretty well contented with his current version of the article. Wikipedia admins as always care only about themselves and not about truthfulness of the article. I have made website specifically about Stomakhin, you may join me and couple of other fellows at <a href="http://russophobes.awardspace.com" class="external free" title="http://russophobes.awardspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://russophobes.awardspace.com</a>.

Let the Americans, according to their deserts, reap as they has sown. Americans should be killed, and only killed, for there is no one among them who is normal, intelligent, or who can be talked with and for understanding of whom we could rely. Harsh collective responsibility of all Americans should be introduced, of all loyal American citizens for the actions of the government elected by them -- for the genocide, executions, ordeals, trade with corpses...

<p>O'K, I can suggest a compromise version. You and Vlad made two valid points. First, we must tell that Stomakhin was convicted for <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>.

<p>I think this text is as NPOV and fair as it can possibly be with respect to the living person (Stomakhin). Moreover, it is explanatory and encyclopedic. A reader can only read this Summary and do not read anything else, as suppose to be with any good Summary. Note that we do not blame Russian military forces of any atrocities. This is something "he said" (see citation from the court sentence in this article).

<dd>Biophys, please explain why you think this version is different from another? I think you have a problem. Stomakhin is not notable by critics of Putin or government, actually. Or you could prove it with citations from his works or writings of Russian journalists or political activists about Stomakhin written before the court? His samizdat newspaper had very little number of issues. Everyone in Russia critisizes Putin and government. Stomakhin is notable for his 'Kill!Kill!Kill!". Anything else is POV. CPJ - is just a US government sponsored propaganda medium.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be right that he was not a notable person before his arrest (his newspaper indeed had a very small number of issues). But he became notable after his arrest and due to this arrest and conviction, because his case attracted attention of notable people and organizations who perceived this case as an attack on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech.html" title="Free speech">free speech</a> in Russia. That is how his marginal and questionable writings and activities became significant. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 19:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC) I corrected slightly my text above to reflect your comment.

<dd>Anna Politkovskaya and Moscow Helsinki Group do not have any relevance as politicians. Stomahin was politician. Politkovskaya and Moscow Helsinki group should be scrapped from the text. The term "marginal" should be replaced by the "radical" or "extemist". And that group is notable not by the opposition to Putin, but is notable by its inflamatory statements and Stomakhin as a leader was sentenced for their extremist activities. "After all atrocities.." passage should be deleted since it doesn't have any relevance to Stomakhin it is original research. He was convicted not 'for his writings' but for 'extremist activities'. The passage 'The ruling was considered by many human rights organizations and activists as a landmark case of prosecuting <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_speech.html" title="Free speech">free speech</a> in modern Russia' should be excluded. This is a case of extremism and not freedom of speech.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. I can agree with you and Vlad on the following. 1. It is not so important that Stomakhin criticized Russia's authorities. It is important <i>how rabidly</i> he criticized the authorities. 2. Being a leader of a marginal political group is not notable. 3. Politkovskaya is probably irrelevant. 4. Stomakhin's claims with respect to Russian State should be included. 5. The question who committed "atrocities" is not really relevant. However, Stomakhin criticized Putin and his administration rather than Russia's authorities in general (such as to say Yeltsin administration). Actually, it seems that Stomakhin tried to offend Putin personally. Also, we should focus on the meaning of Stomakhin's claims, rather than on any defamatory wording (such as calling Putin "Saddam Hussein"). So, I suggest the following version:</dd>

<p>O'K, if you do not like "mass murderer", let's write "Saddam Hussein" and include something about terrorism, calls for extremism, etc. The citation was provided in the article; so there is no need to repeat it here.

<p>Biophys, first, if you aren't going to discuss it, nobody holds you here. Second. But if you are ready for further talks:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He claimed that Russia is a prison of nations that has no right to exist" It's softening of his views. He considered Russia a prison of nations which must be destroyed.</dd>
<dd>Biophys. Nobody has a right to take hostages in a peaceful country far from place of war actions. It's not even an act of war. It's called terrorism. Otherwise we should call 9/11 fight of rebels. Why Barayev didn't fight against Russian forces deployed in Chechnya (which would be war), but took hostages in peaceful Moscow Theather? It's terrorism. (And if you want to condemn actions of Russian forces during the war, do it at appropriate pages.)</dd>
<dd>So. "He argued that Chechen separatists are <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fighters.html" title="Freedom fighters">freedom fighters</a> who have right for any acts against Russia, " including blah-blah-blah.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way, what, you both don't know what is "Колония общего режима"? It's not a prison. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_farm.html" title="Prison farm">Prison farm</a> is the best fitting of what I found. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllol_f47b.html" title="User:Ellol">ellol</a> 10:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We are moving too slow. Now, it is my turn to suggest an improvement for this article. I suggest to delete last paragraph about a defamatory publication by Maksim Sokolov. I can agree that Izvestia is a "reliable source". But this particular article is not a <i>neutral</i> source. Clearly, the comparison of Stomakhin with Hitler is not fair. Hitler is a mass murderer. Stomakhin did not kill or assaulted anyone and did not order to kill anyone. <i>We should not use Sokolov's writings in the article about Stomakhin, just as we should not use Stomakhin's writings in the article about Vladimir Putin.</i><a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC) You could object that some other sources are also not neutral. Good. We can discuss them as well. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bu-ga-ga... Biophys you are incredibly ignorant. I wonder how you could be scientist if you don't know one simple thing about Hitler. Hitler never killed a single person. You can't call him murderer since he never killed anyone except himself. He just inspired mass murders, and Stomakhin had done so too. He is writing Kill!Kill!Kill!, and that's why he was jailed.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hitler <i>ordered</i> killing people. Stomakhin did not. Therefore, a comparison with Hitler is defamatory and certainly not neutral. Same can be said about writings of Stomakhin with regard to Putin and Russians. According to Wikipedia recommendations, such sources are not appropriate to use in biographies of living people. I would not use anything from Stomakhin writings in the article about Putin.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ellol, considering that large portions of the text put into the article by Biophys come from the blog "La Russophobe" what is evident through simple Google search, I think that Biophys is actually the author of the blog "La Russophobe". Just look at this <a href="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" class="external free" title="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" rel="nofollow">http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html</a>! Do you recognize Biophys texts? Biophys also tried to create an article here in Wikipedia about that blog and it was deleted. I think Biophys was making advertisement for his blog and that was the reason. It is evident from the blog that its author is Russian living in US, as also is Biophys. That Guy - author of the Blog (who could be Biophys) is at huge rats with the author of another blog who presents alternative POV - <a href="http://www.veryrussian.net/2006/boris-stomakhin-the-opposition-journalist-who-wanted-me-killed.html" class="external free" title="http://www.veryrussian.net/2006/boris-stomakhin-the-opposition-journalist-who-wanted-me-killed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.veryrussian.net/2006/boris-stomakhin-the-opposition-journalist-who-wanted-me-killed.html</a> <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 12:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
