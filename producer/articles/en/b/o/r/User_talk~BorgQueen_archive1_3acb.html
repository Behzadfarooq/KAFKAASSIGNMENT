<p>I see you removed information posted to <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baphomet.html" title="Baphomet">Baphomet</a> by <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosinfire_8831.html" title="User:Khaosinfire">User:Khaosinfire</a>. You gave the following edit comment: "There is no historical evidence that proves Baphomet was identical with a pagan fertility god. Thers is only speculation, and a speculation shouldn't be stated as a fact in an encyclopedia." I agree with that wholeheartedly, as did other editors on that page. Khaosinfire has since moved to putting the same unsourced information on <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baphomet_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Baphomet (disambiguation)">Baphomet (disambiguation)</a> and has repeatedly put it back after myself and another editor removed it. He's done it again and I can't remove it without violating 3RR. I would appreciate it if you check the page out and revert it to the last good version if the unsourced speculations are there. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:21, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I am a native german and my source for the new <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltgeist" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltgeist" rel="nofollow">weltgeist</a> chapter is my translation of the german <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltgeist" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltgeist" rel="nofollow">weltgeist</a> if you can improve on it ,please do. I hope theres some useful info, since I am new to all this, Its 4am here in Sydney, so I got to say good night. If theres any more Info you need, I will contact you tomorrow, cheers and good night,<a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGuss_861a.html" title="User:Guss">Guss</a> 18:11, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this stub is really coming along and I enjoy very much getting material together and seeing it all grow more universally.</p>
<p>Its amazing to me, how so many concepts and aspects of any one subject or object interlink and then everything grows and comes together like a perfect puzzle, creating the bigger Picture. I am not an Academic.I also dont think that wikipedia is here to copy Textbooks.I believe it is much more than that!</p>
<p>By researching and digesting Ideas and concepts an understanding can be achieved that can be shared with anyone , coming to wikipedia - even if they are no academics .</p>
<p>What good is Knowledge,if it is so abstract that it cannot be communicated to others?</p>
<p>I read some Books by Albert Einstein and i was amazed by the way he writes so effortlessly and uncomplicated.</p>
<p>Some Academics consider themselves elite, and are very proud of the fact,that noone understands a thing they say.</p>
<p>what good is that? Its just dumb... anyway , I answered some critic on the Geist talkpage,</p>
<p>who thought I had to justify the ghost philosophy to him and that the page had no relevance. yet he offered no contribution .</p>
<p>I had to control myself not to let lose and tell him with 2 basic words, what I really think&#160;!</p>
<p>anyway,hope you are well,I reckon the Geist Page needs a Painting by some symbolist esoteric painter or something like that.</p>
<p>just to liven the page up a bit? what do you think?</p>
<p>got to go now, Dinners waiting,thanks <a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGuss_861a.html" title="User:Guss">Guss</a> 07:23, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you BorgQueen ,for your good advise.I know you are right of course.

I agree,the <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geist_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Geist (philosophy)">Geist (philosophy)</a> page still needs a lot of work,but at this stage it is only a stub and like many pages on wikipedia, it is an ongoing process.</p>
<p>I only made a small contribution to geist so far, anyway the page is labeled as a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a> ,inviting People to contribute . I did not start the page, but came across it through <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a> and found it very helpful and interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe it could be includet to the Zeitgeist Page? Anyway, it is not that important to me, since I got plenty of other projects going on at present in my life and I am too busy.</p>
<p>I agree,that <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.victorianweb.org/" rel="nofollow">Art</a> should relate to the theme of the page, but I know that there is lots that would be suitable.</p>

<p>2 days ago, I created an article about 1985 sword and sorcery motion picture Red Sonja and placed it to Red Sonja (check article Red Sonja history). I also moved the comic book character article to his correct place Red Sonya. But an user Kchishol1970 wiped my work and moved article to an unsuitable place “Red Sonja (movie)”. Therefore, I moved the article to a more suitable place Red sonja. But he again moved it a to third place “Red sonja (movie)” without a good reason. I believe Red Sonja is exactly place for this article since the character's article already exists Red Sonya but preventing my self in wiping war I choosed this place as a second choice, so please don’t move the article to any third place like “Red Sonja (movie)” since its hard to find or search for a new user. However, we can still make decisions for its correct place Red Sonja. Place your opinions to my taik page.<br />

<p>Hello BorgQueen. Can you explain why you categorized my edits to <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xanthone.html" title="Xanthone">xanthone</a> as vandalism? I added two valid categories and removed linkspam (identical to linkspam that has been repeatedly removed by others from this article and many others.)

<dl>
<dd>I am not entirely certain that it is a "spam". The external link seems to contain relevant information to me. And it would have been better if you added edit summary when you removed it. I resurrected the categories you had added and removed the Test2a-n warning since you provide explanation in my talk page now. If you think the external link is certainly inappropriate and should be removed, I suggest you provide your reasoning in the talk page of the article and gather consensus. Thank you. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 21:16, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I'm afraid the anonymous user is correct about the translation from the German WP article. This states: -</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Der Begriff geht auf den deutschen Philosophen Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) zurück. Dieser setzte sich im Jahre 1769 mit der Schrift "Genius seculi" des Philologen Christian Adolph Klotz kritisch auseinander und führte das Wort Zeitgeist als Übersetzung von genius seculi (lat. genius „Schutzgeist“ und lat. saeculum „Jahrhundert“) ins Deutsche ein.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I would render this as: -</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The concept goes back to the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803). In 1769 he wrote a critique of the work "Genius seculi" by the philologist Christian Adolph Klotz and introduced the word Zeitgeist into German as a translation of genius seculi (latin: genius - "guardian spirit" and saeculum - "century").</i></dd>

<p>Let me begin by saying that I'm in a really bad mood, and that although that has nothing to do with you it is possible that I'll be snappy and not realise it until later. You know how it is, when you think, "Ok, be nice" yet still fail?</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha.html" title="Alpha">Alpha</a> → Alpha (disambiguation):<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, pages titled <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Foo (disambiguation)">Foo (disambiguation)</a> are intended to be used when <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo.html" title="Foo">Foo</a> has a primary meaning that it is presumed that people will want to see. Please see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, when you perform a page move, you have to correct the redirects per <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page_3490.html" title="Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page">Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page</a>. If you'll look at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Alpha_931f.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Alpha">Special:Whatlinkshere/Alpha</a> you'll see that this would be a big job. The reason that I noticed this was that I was working through [[Alpha]], fixing the links, and it takes forever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, when you got to <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_%28letter%29.html" title="Alpha (letter)">Alpha (letter)</a>, the disambig notice at the top is useless. A person would have had to type "Alpha (letter)" in the GO box to get there without having already been to the disambiguation page, which means that they are probably not looking for other uses of "Alpha".</dd>
</dl>
<p>So I'd like to put this back to alpha, would that be ok with you?<br />

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your explanation. I moved Alpha (disambiguation) back to its original name, as per your reasoning. However if you discover such mistakes in future you are welcome to correct it yourself and provide me a notice - but I still appreciate your courtesy. As for the disambig notice at the top of <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_%28letter%29.html" title="Alpha (letter)">Alpha (letter)</a>, another editor already has corrected a few days ago, but I take your explanation as a useful future reference. No, you are not snappy at all! Thank you for your civility and hard work. Keep the good work. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 06:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and the disambig notice thing is that, another editor before me had put it in the form of "See Alpha" so I had made it disambig notice, for the sake of layout. In other words, I merely tried to make it look better, but it wasn't my idea. Thanks. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 06:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The taxobox looks good (except for one small mistake in the authority, which I corrected).</p>
<p>You have included more ranks in the taxobox than usual. In general, you're encouraged to include only the main ranks in the taxobox (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species), plus only those minor ranks that are important for the rank you are describing. So the article <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scyllaridae.html" title="Scyllaridae">Scyllaridae</a> (a family) shows the minor ranks between order and family, but not the ones above "order"; an article on a species like <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moreton_bay_bug.html" title="Moreton bay bug">Moreton bay bug</a> should probably not include the infraorder and suborder. I'm not a biologist, so I do not know the importance of those ranks; if you had a special reason to include them, that's fine. For example, the subphylum <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crustacea.html" title="Crustacea">Crustacea</a> is commonly known, and the inclusion of that rank does convey useful information to the reader, so it should stay.</p>
<p>Only thing missing now is a picture; I've looked for it on commons, and on images.google.com, but could not find one that we can use. Pity. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 11:46, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_zoologists_by_author_abbreviation.html" title="List of zoologists by author abbreviation">List of zoologists by author abbreviation</a> may be useful.

<dd>Oh. It links to Peter Wilhelm Lund (1801-1880), who described the species in 1793. There might be a problem here.

<p>I do not doubt that a company with so many different businesses is notable. However, the user needs to understand some things:</p>

<li>He can copy the material only if he has the express permission of the copyright holder.</li>
<li>Any material posted is subject to the GFDL.</li>
<li>Other users will modify the article to conform to NPOV.</li>

<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a>,</p>
<p>I see you removed the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">H.K.</a> commercial link from <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">Airsoft</a>. I've got absolutely no problem with this - sensible. However, since there seems to have been a bit of vandalism to the external links section (which has quietened down a bit lately), it might be a good idea to leave a note to that effect on the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Talk%7EAirsoft_d740.html" title="Talk:Airsoft">talk page</a>.</p>
<p>While your edit obviously won't be mistaken for vandalism, you might help encourage the vandals to post on the talk page before deleting links. (Or is that just wishful thinking ...)</p>
<p>BTW, are you User:81.151.150.254 who made the deletion I reversed?</p>

<p>Within Peterborough they are very notable. Soon they will move around the country and their noteability will spread. Certainly they are more notable than Penis Reflexology. Mark and Nicko have had a positive impact on many people's lives with their music and comedy. The article is intended to spread their fame so that others may benefit.

<p>Hi BorgQueen,</p>
<p>I noticed you have tagged <a href="../../../d/l/s/Image%7EDLs.jpg_bfe6.html" title="Image:DLs.jpg">Image:DLs.jpg</a> and four other images as nosource, which puzzled me on why you did so. It appears to be a legitimate upload with a proper copyright image tag. (With the uploader's name watermarked in the image itself.)</p>
<p>In any case, they are transferred to Wikipedia Commons, as it appears the user has uploader too many images of the same kind, so it's better to have them reorganised into albums.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I've reverted {No source} tags — I had applied the tag because the image summary didn't explicitly state the picture has been created by the uploader himself/herself. Merely applying a copyright tag normally isn't complete enough; the reason the particular tag has been selected needs to be stated. But I will leave it to you from now on. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 08:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't quite get why you put the {{advert}}-Tag in the article, it looks okay to me. Please explain. --<a href="../../../m/k/i/User%7EMkill_ba08.html" title="User:Mkill">Mkill</a> 19:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi BQueen! Sorry for the late reply! Anyway, this can serve for not only this case but for any other case related to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. كبابه is more a spoken language than كبابة, which is more <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Standard_Arabic_f172.html" title="Modern Standard Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusha.html" title="Fusha">Fusha</a>, if you want. Academically speaking, كبابة is the right thing though I don't believe <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubeb.html" title="Cubeb">Cubeb</a> got a lot of thing to do with Arabic. Anyway, and for personal reasons, you can compare MSA with Fusha (language) and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_Arabic_579f.html" title="Literary Arabic">Literary Arabic</a>. <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 22:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up™</i></sup></font></a></small></p>

<p>NPOV agent reporting for duty... I don't have a lot of time to dig through yet another major controversy, but if you give me the versions in history you think should stay and who the main players are I can take a look at it.</p>
<p>Would appreciate you stepping in to look at <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">Mythology</a> if you would. We have some religious people trying to redefine myth to mean false belief, when that's not the academic usage. They want to do this so the word myth cannot be used in any connection with Christianity, because they find it insulting, despite the lengths we go to in the article to explain the academic version of the term and the difference with the layman's idea. Not surprisingly, they are fine with people calling other religions myth, just not theirs, a clear case of POV-pushing. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:20, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm taking steps to lodge a formal complaint against <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">User:Theodore7</a> due to various reasons that I'm sure that you are aware of, or have experienced by now. Right now I have a rough draft of the complaint that I would like to have some people look over, add to, correct, and sign if they agree with it. I've never had to do anything like this before, so if you would please take some time to take a look at it and give me some feedback, suggestions, support, etc., then I would really appreciate it.

<p>Although the Taiwan is not recognized as an independent country by most countries around the world, it none the less is currently being governed by a body that is distinct to the government of People's Republic of China (PRoC,) nor does it obey any of its laws.</p>
<p>As such to state "... such as Japan, China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao)... Despite rumors that Airsoft has been made illegal in mainland China, it is actually legal and very popular, both in mainland China and in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao as well." creats an impression that Taiwan is currently governed by PRoC and its laws, but is not a statement of fact.</p>
<p>In the future if and when Taiwan ... rejoin PRoC, it would then be appropriate to state it as such. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.111.73.2 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.111.73.2.html" title="User talk:67.111.73.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.111.73.2_3138.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.111.73.2">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>as a neophyte to computers in general and the fact i'd never heard of wikipedia before last novemeber,i thought i'd pick a subject as obscure as i could think of at a moment's notice on my friend's computer.. the subject being leaf mould,(the English spelling). i have only personal experience that shredding fallen leaves with a rotary lawnmower really does speed up the decomposition process. not being at all web community savvy i didn't cite any sources. i am personally amazed at the power of the internet and the amazing scope of this web site in general. it is a very powerful tool and i am happy that my little snippet of information has been assimilated. yours faithfully ,ian,manchester,England,Europe,the world/Earth/the milky way,the universe. truly amazing. apologies to all the experienced computer/intellectual people i may have slightly irritated. i'm just a learner at the moment! no apologies though for lack of capitals,spelling,punctuation or grammar. what's a tilde by the way? 82.69.52.44 23:17, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Borgqueen, please refrain from deleting Talk page. I've asked you to please also use the other talk pages, such as the Astrology Talk Page before instantly reverting to non-sourced articles. You have asked me, as a Wikipedia newbie, not to delete my own Talk Page, and I suggest you show the same consideration here as well to show your leadership by example.
