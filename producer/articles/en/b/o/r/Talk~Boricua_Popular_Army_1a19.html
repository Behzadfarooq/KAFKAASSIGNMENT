<p>Another arguement that Nationalist leader Albizu Campos occured when a Puerto Rican struck a judge and was brought to trail. Albizu was the lawyer and made little attempt to defend the man. When he was sentenced, Albizu filed an appeal in which he argued in the US courts was that the Treaty of Paris was illegal due to the wording that PR would be ceeded to the USA in "payment" for Spains actions in the war. This is a violation of the 13th Amendment according to Campos. The US courts let the man go free rather than bring the appeal to trial.</p>
<p>Also all parties agree Puerto Rico is under colonial rule, the nationalists/independence party has alwasy said this as have the statehooders and the PPD joined them as the last party to do so in 1978. It is also in the UN lists of colonies. I'm taking out the wording that "what they would characterize as colonial"--24.152.251.248 07:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The phrase <i>"politically interested people"</i> seems a remarkable characterization for those who joined a violent <i><a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party_e95d.html" title="Puerto Rican Independence Party">independentista</a></i> group, but this is the least of my concerns.</p>

<p>The invocation of these particular violent leaders of independence struggles seems to me to be absolutely arbitrary. They were basically military leaders. The Macheteros' tactics do not seem to me to be particularly military. It seems to me that these particular individuals are singled out not to shed light on the subject but simply because they are individuals who were involved in wars of independence and are generally favorably viewed.</p>

<p>NPOV is good but this article is rife with statements that have no sourcing whatsoever, such as the claim that the Macheteros' ranks have "swelled" to 1,100 members. Personally, I think this number is absurd, and would bet that 99% of those people are sympathizers, which is something completely different from active members. --<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlybd5_e6f7.html" title="User:Flybd5">Flybd5</a> 22:06, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I prefer not to have an edit war, but two of my changes appear to have been effectively reverted. One is substantive, the other just a matter of spelling, but in both cases I believe I am correct. I'd rather get consensus here than keep reverting changes in the article.</p>
<p>At the end of the first paragraph, I changed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...based on the island of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. They campaign for the independence of the country from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>."</dd>

</dl>
<p>I believe that referring to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a "country" is POV, favoring the <i>independentista</i> perspective. Conversely, I did not want to choose "Commonwealth", because (although that is an accurate statement of current status) it begs the question of whether that status is appropriate. I would like to reinstate my neutral wording. If anyone disagrees, please comment here before 11 Jan 04.</p>
<p>The other is simply a matter of spelling. I'm not a native Spanish speaker, but someone changed my <i>"FederaciÃ³n Universitaria Pro Independencia"</i> to <i>"Federacion Universitaria Pro Independencia"</i>. I'm pretty sure "FederaciÃ³n" should have an acute accent on the "o", but I'll go with the other if a native speaker will say that it is actually correct. Again, please comment here before 11 Jan 04.</p>

<dd>Puerto Rico is a NATION, I would say, but a colony (a country has it's own government, right?). But it sends it's own people to the olympics. Plus, nation is far more broad, ie Nation of Islam or the Native American Nations, Jewish Nation. Nation would be a group of people with a strong independent identity.--128.59.143.41 06:25, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following was recently and anonymously added to the lead paragraph (slightly edited here to improve the English); I've cut it pending citation. "They do not consider themselves as much a 'political' group, as an enforcer, or facilitator of Puerto Rican people seeking justice, economic sovereignty, and political freedom." If there is a citation for this, it clearly belongs in the article. However, saying without citation what the group "consider themselves" is not appropriate. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:54, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The same editor upped the number of their active membership from 800 to 1100. Lacking a clear citation for any number, I have let the new number stand.

<p>Someone recently made a change without citation that I don't know what to make of. Previously it said "Supporters of independence in Puerto Rico polls are a small electoral minority (under 10%) when status plebiscites are held." 10% was changed to 4%. I don't know the actual numbers; does someone have a good citation on this?

<ul>
<li>I made the change. No political party that supports independence for Puerto Rico has ever garnered more than 4% of the vote in any general election or plebiscite. There is no evidence to my knowledge that could support an assertion of 10% of the residents of Puerto Rico supporting independence. I have also added a link to results of all elections and plebiscites in Puerto Rico since 1932. --<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlybd5_e6f7.html" title="User:Flybd5">Flybd5</a> 00:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The leader of the group, has indeed been killed in an FBI operation in the western municipality of Hormigueros. It happened on September 23, 2005. Coincidentaly, September 23 is the conmemoration of Grito De Lares In Puerto Rico. The death ocurred after an FBI operation, details of which have not yet been released (9/27/05). The puertorrican government has asked for an independent investigation, which FBI director Robert Muller has aproved and will be done by the United States Attorney General's Office. Some people in the island suspect that the operation was intended to kill Ojeda Rios, and that he was never intended to come out alive, but as the FBI reports have not been revealed these details remain a mystery. <small>â<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 140.254.104.22 (talk&#160;â¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.254.104.22_77b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.254.104.22">contribs</a>) 28 Sept 2005.</small></p>

<dd>This isn't just an issue of the FBI saying that the Macheteros are a terrorist group -- with the exception of Claridad, which is published by a political party supporting independence, all media in Puerto Rico and the US refers to FALN and the Macheteros as terrorists because that is what they do -- they try to advance their political agenda by carrying out acts of terrorism. Not once have the Macheteros shown the slightest interest in using the highly developed political process in Puerto Rico to achieve their goals. They are not a political organization, and they represent an infinitesimally tiny fraction of the residents of the island (even accepting the wild 2,100 member assertion, that's a mere five hundredths of one percent of the estimated population of Puerto Rico.

<dd>I very clearly posted that the organization is classified as a terrorist organization by the FBI, by the media and by UN and international law definition. The FBI does not "describe" them as terrorists, the FBI says they -are- terrorists. If you have a problem with that you need to take that up with the FBI, not with me. The excuse of non-neutral language should never be used to justify rationalization based on personal feelings about the facts. The facts are the facts. If you can disprove what I posted as fact, then post the proof. The consensus definition of terrorism on the UN Office on Drug and Crime web page fits the Macheteros like a glove.--<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlybd5_e6f7.html" title="User:Flybd5">Flybd5</a> 23:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These hardly bear out a claim that "the vast majority of Puerto Ricans consider Los Macheteros to be terrorists and unpatriotic". The <i>Economist</i> article you label "One" refers to "the reluctant affection that some Puerto Ricans had for Mr Ojeda RÃ­os." "Two" asserts "Most Puerto Ricans do not agree with the methods employed by the Macheteros" (far short of "terrorists and unpatriotic") but also says, "The assassination [of Ojeda Rios] has drawn criticism even from those who advocate statehood for the islandâ¦the circumstances around Ojeda Riosâ death have united a politically diverse Puerto Rico. The last time these sectors united was following the death of a young Puerto Rican man caused by a bomb on the U.S. Navy base in Vieques."</dd>

If this is followed, the article should make it clear <i>who</i> is calling them a terrorist, and that the word does not appear to be used, unqualified, by the "narrative voice" of the article. In other cases, terms such as "militant(s)" may be a suitable alternative, implying a group or individual who uses force to attain their objectives.

<p><i>Additional comments, based on the article and the discussion above:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>To claim that an organization is terrorist based on a UN definition, or a definition in federal or international law, may violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (in addition to <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a>). Instead, refer to cites which say so - do not make this point yourself. Linking to a source with a general "Definitions of Terrorism" usually does not qualify.</li>
<li>Be careful not to give the FBI <i>too much</i> weight because they are a party to the conflict. But it should be included and properly cited. Contrary to what it says in the article, the current cite isn't the official FBI terrorist list, but a speech by the Director of FBI (additionally, the text mostly refers to PR groups as "separatists" or "extremists").</li>
<li>Further, cites provided so far do not state that "the vast majority of Puerto Ricans consider Los Macheteros to be terrorists and unpatriotic" as far as I can see (from a quick read), as already noted in the discusion</li>
<li>I'm unsure why <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a> is relevant to the article. His WP article doesn't mention PR at all, and the Google search term <i>"David Horowitz" Boricua terrorists</i> returns less than 50 hits. The FrontPageMag article linked to in the discussion above doesn't mention Horowitz or PR at all, or so it seems. Note that FrontPageMag might be considered a dubious (or not neutral) source by some poeple, see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="WP:V">WP:V#Sources_of_dubious_reliability</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I would like to point out that there is a number of sentences with words like <i>supporters believe</i>, <i>others argue</i> and <i>a susbtantial percentage</i>, which do not conform to <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>. These claims should be reworded and properly cited.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please leave a comment if you like, and keep up the good work! -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">Steve Hart</a> 20:46, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The January 1977 bomb incident badly needs citation. I tried following it up, and what I found ("Group Says It Planted Bombs", <i>New York Times</i>, January 6, 1977. p. 7) is that the bombing was claimed by the "Lolita Lebron Puerto Rican Liberation Command". <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita_Lebr%C3%B3n_a04f.html" title="Lolita LebrÃ³n">Lolita LebrÃ³n</a> would have been in prison at that time, so someone was presumably using her name as a tribute. Is there some documentation for saying that it was the Macheteros? Or is there separate documentation claiming that this attempted bombing was claimed by the Macheteros? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
