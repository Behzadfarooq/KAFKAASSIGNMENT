<p>Borley Rectory was constructed near Borley Church by the Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull in 1863<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, a year after being named <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rector.html" title="Rector">rector</a> of the church. The building was a large <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brick.html" title="Brick">brick</a> rectory that replaced the rather earlier Georgian house built for Rev Herringham. It would eventually house his wife as well as fourteen children.</p>

Borley Rectory in 1892</div>

</div>
<p>The church itself dates to the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> and the area is mentioned in the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domesday_Book_b82d.html" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> as having a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manor_house.html" title="Manor house">manor house</a>. Ghost-hunters like to quote the legend of a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a> supposedly built in this area around <a href="../../../1/3/6/1362.html" title="1362">1362</a>, according to which a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> from the monastery carried on a relationship with a <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nun</a> from a nearby <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convent.html" title="Convent">convent</a>. After their affair was discovered, the monk was <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_%28legal%29.html" title="Execution (legal)">executed</a> while the nun was bricked up alive in the walls of the convent. It was discovered in 1938 that this legend had no historical basis whatsoever and seems to have been invented by the children of the rector to romanticise their recently-built red-brick rectory. The story of the walling up of the nun was probably taken from a novel by <a href="../../../r/i/d/Rider_Haggard_00fa.html" title="Rider Haggard">Rider Haggard</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borley_Rectory_7039.html" title="Edit section: Hauntings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hauntings</span></h2>
<p>The first known reports of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a> events date to around <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>. At this time, a few locals reported hearing footsteps within the house. On 28th July 1900, four of the daughters of the rector reported seeing what they thought was the <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghost</a> of a nun from 40 yards' distance near the house in twilight: they tried to talk to it, but it disappeared as they got nearer<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. Various people would witness a variety of puzzling incidents, such as a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen, through the next four decades. Henry Dawson Ellis Bull died in 1892 and his son, Revd. Harry Bull, took over the living.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1911, he married a younger divorcee, Ivy, and the couple moved with her daughter to nearby Borley Place until 1920 (when he took over the rectory), whilst his unmarried sisters moved to Chilton Lodge a few miles away.</p>
<p>On 9th June <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, the rector, Harry Bull, died and the rectory again became vacant.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> In the following year, on 2nd October 1928<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>, the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the home. One day, soon after moving in, Mrs. Smith was cleaning out a cupboard when she came across a brown paper package, inside which was the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull.html" title="Skull">skull</a> of a young woman.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Shortly after, the family would report a variety of incidents including the sounds of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_%28instrument%29.html" title="Bell (instrument)">bells</a> ringing, lights appearing in windows, windows shattering, unexplained footsteps, and their daughter was locked in a room with no key. In addition, Mrs Smith saw a horse-drawn <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carriage.html" title="Carriage">carriage</a> at night. The Smiths contacted <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a></i> to ask them to put them in touch with the Society for Psychical Research. On 10th June <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, the paper sent a reporter who promptly wrote the first of a series of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley. The paper also arranged for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Price_33d3.html" title="Harry Price">Harry Price</a>, a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the place that would ultimately make his name famous. He arrived on 12th June<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>. Immediately, objective 'phenomena' of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. 'Spirit messages' were tapped out from the frame of a mirror.</p>
<p>Finally driven from their home by the poor state of the house, the Smiths left Borley on 14th July <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> and, after some difficulty in finding a replacement, the Revd. Lionel Foyster, a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne moved into the rectory<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> with their adopted daughter Adelaide on 16th October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of the various strange incidents that happened, which he sent to Harry Price. Price estimated that, between the Foyster's moving in October 1930 and October <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, some two thousand incidents took place there, including bell-ringing, stones, bottle-throwing and wall-writing. Lionel Foyster's wife Marianne reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena which included her being thrown from her bed.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by "something horrible". Twice, Reverend Foyster tried to conduct an <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exorcism.html" title="Exorcism">exorcism</a>, but his efforts were futile. In the middle of the first, Foyster was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in <i>The Daily Mirror</i>, these incidents attracted much attention at the time from several psychic researchers who investigated, and were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by the Rector's wife, Marianne Foyster. Mrs. Foyster later stated that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in collaboration with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena.</p>
<p>The Foysters left Borley as a result of Lionel's ill health, and Harry Price, after a gap of over five years, renewed his interest in the house, renting the building for a year from May 1937 to May 1938.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Through an advertisement in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> newspaper on 25th May 1937<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>, and subsequent personal interviews, he recruited a corp of forty-eight 'official observers', mostly students, who spent periods, mainly at weekends, at the Rectory with instructions to report any phenomena which occurred. In March 1938, Helen Glanville conducted a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planchette.html" title="Planchette">Planchette</a> <a href="../../../s/%C3%A9/a/S%C3%A9ance.html" title="Séance">séance</a> in Streatham in London.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Price reported that Glanville made contact with two spirits. The first was that of a young nun who identified herself as Marie Lairre.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> She said she had been murdered on the site of Borley Rectory. Her answers were consistent with the local legend (see above). Her French name, though, was a puzzle. She was a French nun who left her religious order, married, and came to live in England. The groom was supposedly none other than Henry Waldengrave, the owner of the seventeenth-century manor house. Price was convinced that the ghostly nun who had been seen for generations was Marie Lairre, condemned to wander restlessly as her spirit searched for a holy burial ground. The wall writings were her pleas for help.</p>
<p>The second spirit to be contacted identified himself by the strange name of "Sunex Amures".<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> He claimed that he would set fire to the rectory at nine o'clock that night. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed. The predictions of Sunex Amures came to pass, in a way, but not that night (27 March 1938). In February 1939, the new owner of the rectory reported that he was unpacking some boxes when an <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_lamp.html" title="Oil lamp">oil lamp</a> in the hallway overturned.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> The fire quickly spread, and Borley Rectory was severely damaged. An onlooker said she saw the figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window. The burning of the rectory was investigated by the insurance company and determined to be an insurance fraud. Harry Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and, almost immediately, two bones of a young woman were discovered. A subsequent meticulous excavation of the cellars over three years revealed nothing further.<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a></p>
<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borley_Rectory_7039.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Since the destruction of the rectory, the events there have been investigated and argued from various angles. After Harry Price's death in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, three members of the English Society for Psychical Research, two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley and published their findings in a book, <i>The Haunting of Borley Rectory</i>, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, which concluded that any evidence for a haunting was hopelessly confused by Harry Price's duplicity. The "Borley Report", as the SPR study has become known, stated that much of the phenomena were either faked or were due to natural causes such as rats and the strange acoustics due to the odd shape of the house. Subsequently, Robert Hastings, an SPR member, discussed several of the charges of duplicity and falsification of evidence made against Price in a paper to the SPR called <i>An Examination of the "Borley Report"</i>, without being able to rebut them convincingly. Hastings's report was never published in book form and is often overlooked.</p>
<p>Further books on the Rectory hauntings have appeared over the years, including a collaboration in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> by ghost-hunter and author <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Underwood_%28parapsychologist%29_5c11.html" title="Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)">Peter Underwood</a> and Price's <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_executor.html" title="Literary executor">literary executor</a> Paul Tabori entitled <i>The Ghosts of Borley</i>, which is generally sympathetic to the idea of paranormal activity at Borley and defends Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was taken in Ivan Banks' <i>The Enigma of Borley Rectory</i> of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> Robert Wood published a study of Marianne Foyster and Borley entitled <i>The Widow of Borley</i>, which was in a similar vein to the "Borley Report". The bibliography continues into <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> with Louis Mayerling's largely fictional <i>We Faked The Ghosts of Borley Rectory</i>.</p>
<p>Reports of paranormal activity are still reported in the area, including Borley Church.</p>
