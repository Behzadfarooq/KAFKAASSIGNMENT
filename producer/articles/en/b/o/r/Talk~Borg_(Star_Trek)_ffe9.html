<p>Recently, some anonymous I.P. removed the whole section about the Borgs ability to adapt being unsupported by onscreen evidence. Because this anonymous coward didn't bother to supply a reason for deleting a whole section that other editors appearantly found usefull information, and mainly because I do think it was useful information, I put the whole section back. If someone thinks it should be deleted, relocated, shortened, or whatever, please do join the discussion HERE, don't just delete a whole section with perfectly good info just because you think it's irrelevant... and certainly don't delete it without giving a reason.

<dd>...and only a few days after I put that section back, <b>another anonymous IP</b> comes in and deletes the whole section again. Well, you know, I'm putting it back <b>again</b>. Several users spent time on building that section. If you think it's nonsense or you think it doesn't belong here, the least you can do is have the decency to enter a civilized discussion here on the talk page. I personally do think that section was usefull information about the Borg. And if people keep deleting it without a discussion, the only thing I feel I can do is put it back.

<dd>Sorry, maybe I don't get it. But the whole thing about the Borg not being able to adapt so quickly to attacks as is sometimes stated, that whole section was backed up with a whole list of references to episodes from Star Trek TNG and VOY. How is that original research? It's merely stating the facts, and some very interesting facts at that. Maybe you have some suggestions as to what form we could mold that information in so it *would* be suitable for the article, because frankly, I do think it deserves a place in the article. In several episodes, it is stated that the Borg are able to adapt to any fact quickly. That's a fact. In several (or maybe even MORE) episodes, the Borg appear to NOT be able to adapt quickly to every attack. That's just another fact. How are facts not allowed to be in an encyclopedia article? Oh and just another point; just because you think the section that we're talking about wasn't entirely right... why do you delete the whole section? There was some good info in there that was perfectly suitable for the article appart from the whole original research debate. For instance, the part I added about the explanation that was given in one of the VOY episodes about why the Borg are not able to respond to every attack quickly.

<dd>You know, I just typed a whole story about why I think not every part of the section you deleted qualifies as original research, and all you can respond with is repeating the definition of original research again. I... don't really what to type now. Maybe I need to repeat what I said: that section was merely stating facts from the episodes. It was not a "theory" that was previously unpublished, they are just hard, solid facts, that everyone who watched the episodes could have seen. That is NOT original research, those are just FACTS. And, do me a favour, come with a reply a LITTLE more specific next time. Otherwise this is just an edit war in disguise. Typing 1-line replies is NOT a decent discussion. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagingR2_dfa4.html" title="User:RagingR2">RagingR2</a> 01:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And oh, by the way, I'm sorry if you feel your talk page is not the place for me to start a discussion about this issue. I don't really care where we have the discussion, as long as there is place for discussion. There are too many people around here just reverting other people's additions, supplying a short explanation (if any) and then running off to never be heard of again. So sorry if I used your talk page (after all YOU were the one who made the edit) but I just wanted to make sure I got a response from you at all, after all you are likely to see a change in your own talk page more quickly than a change in the discussion page of just another one of the many pages you edited.

<p>As an outsider who has never even looked at this article before, I feel I should chime in on original research. RagingR2, while you may have linked to good sources for examples, the conclusion is still yours, which is why it is invalid for Wikipedia. I am sure if you dig, you can find someone from a reputable source with the same theory. Remember, both of you have the best interest of the article at heat, even if you currently disagree. If you remain civil through this disagreement, you may find you are in agreement on other issues. It's happened with me. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><span style="color:black">☓</span></big>) 02:55, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I get your point. I really am not trying to dump my own original theories here. However, have any of you both seen the Episode(s) Scorpion Part 1 &amp; 2 from ST:VOY? The conclusion which you suppose is mine (well actually not just mine, since I didn't write the entire section in dispute here, but oh well), is actually pretty much literally in those episodes. Chakotay and B'Elana literally say something like "The Borg can't understand what they can't assimilate, which is why they couldn't assimilate species 8472, because they have such an advanced immune system." I could find the exact quote if you wish, but anyway, I just thought this was valuable information, added to the overall general assumption that's in the "Overview" section of the article: about the Borg being able to respond to any attack quickly. And <i>that</i> isn't my writing; but maybe <i>that</i> should be regarded as an original research conclusion that isn't backup up by any sources. Maybe we could agree on just adding those quotes from the Scorpion 1 &amp; 2 to the Trivia section or something like that? You know, without any added conclusions or other user-made additions; just the quotes as cold hard facts. If the overall statement that the Borg is <i>generally</i> able to addapt to attacks quickly is allowed to be in the article because this is stated in several episodes of the series/films (and is thus not original research), than in my opinion, so is the sidenote to this general conclusion as it is stated in the Scorpion episodes. The only difference is the <i>number</i> of episodes it is featured in, but it's both valuable information about the Borg that does deserve a place in the article. And oh well, maybe the fact that the Borg can't always quickly addapt to an attack isn't in very many episodes, so maybe it isn't really *that* important to the overal general picture of the Borg throughout the whole franchise... that's why I am proposing to add it to the Trivia section or something like that, somewhere towards the end of the article.</dd>
<dd>(Oh and guys, you both thanks for replying by the way, I'm very glad we can have decent talk about this.)</dd>

<dd>What you propose sounds like a good compromise (at least until somebody actually does publish an analysis). The Borg have been portrayed many different ways depending on the whims of the writer - no dispute about that. It was always about the Original Research aspect. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 16:05, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand. It was never my intention to publish anything that's a subjective personal analysis. Well, okay, seems like we could solve this. Let's see. Now that I look at the rest of the article, doesn't this info belong to the (already existing) section about Assimilation? We could add a few sentences to the end of that section, maybe something like this:
<dl>
<dd>"Asimilation is the main way for The Borg to gain information about a "new species", i.e. a species of which no individuals have been previously assimilated by The Borg. The Borg are less skilled in "investigating"; gaining information about species <i>before</i> they are assimilated (source: Episodes "Scorpion Part 1 &amp; 2" from ST:VOY). Moreover, because of the way the assimilation works, species with an extremely advanced immune system such as Species 8472 are able to withstand assimilation; their immune system destroys the nanobots before they can do anything."</dd>

<p>I'd lose the quotation marks and italics. The reference needs cleaning up, but that's easier done in place. I'd change the last sentence to something like this -</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because assimilation depends on nanoprobes, species with an extremely advanced immune system such as Species 8472 are able to withstand assimilation.</dd>

<dd>Agreed, sounds good. Well, I'll add this to the article then. I just noticed there's a separate article for the "Assimilation" too.

<p><b>Good luck</b>, this article is so filled with personal opinions and unverifiable "facts" ("the Borg harbor no ill will to anyone" or "..the two-part episode "The Best of Both Worlds", widely considered among Star Trek’s best episodes." and yes, "Given the high technical sophistication of the Borg and her apparent destruction on numerous occasions, the Borg Queen may be some sort of unique multidimensional creature who can be in many places and times at once and/or is multiply-redundant ".) that your task seems almost impossible Chris.</p>
<p>@#@#@#</p>
<p>This whole part needs to remove, it a joke. Who cares what William Shatner thinks!</p>
<p>"William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens postulated a different base of operations for the Borg. They had the Borg "homeworld" as a planet totally converted into circuitry over millennia. The Borg Planet itself is the Queen/Hive Mind Center and it is lonely, and looking for another mind similar to itself. They also explain Borg "inconsistencies" as colonies out of direct contact with the Borg Planet, but still answering to the Hive Mind. The Borg home planet is eventually destroyed by Kirk.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. It's semi-canonical. Also, I believe in one of the Dark Mirror books that Shatner wrote also mentions of the easy defeat of the Borg by the Human/Vulcan alliance in the mirror universe not too soon after first contact. --The Manator E 22:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under the headline overview it says that the name "Borg" is a short version of cybernetic organism. I would just like to know if this is a fact or if this is an opinion about the origin of the name. I thought that the word Borg was a "name" of the "species" itself.</p>
<p><br />
--While never directly stated, the name "Borg" is simply a short version of "Cyborg" which in effect, is a short version of "Cybernetic Organism." The Borg do not have a species, nor have they created one. One way to think of it, is another nationality. Americans refer to themselves as Americans, but that is not their Race. It is simply easier than saying "Chinese, Japanaese, Native American, British, Canadian, etc...Human". So, rather than say a bunch of species names, they simply call themselves the borg. It's just a bunch of species that only have the fact that their thoughts are given to them, and cybernetic additions in common. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasha4890_6ef2.html" title="User:Kasha4890">Kasha4890</a> 01:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The second paragraph of the history section... am I the only one who thinks this is totally wrong?

<p>And as for the subspace thing... the Borg have transwarp portals. Note that Voyager was able to travel back to the alpha quadrant much quicker than they could actually send a subspace radio transmission.</p>

<p>This is Captain Digness speaking.</p>
<p>The reason I have kept on editing your work should be rather apparent. If you say these borg came from the future why is their technology limited i.e. They are weaker than a pre-Federation starship. What is more is that I personally spent hours researching this subject before I made such claims. Do the research; all the evidence supports my claims. Check for yourself.</p>

<p>Alright I too agree. I will do research and bring it to <i>you</i> personally the results and I realize that I was right about the subspace factor and the Borg traveling pre-trans warp due to the fact that they would no doubt have used to evade the Enterprise rather than being destroyed. The fact that they did not suggests they did not have those capabilities at the time. In fact they went the other direction than where the subspace sorridor was located. If you look this up you will see that I am correct. However if you need proof I will bring it to you also by the end of this week. And I request of you to defend against my statement that if the Borg technology is more primitive than that of first contact how are they from first contact. Unless you can answer this with substantial proof I will continue my editing until someone or something puts an end to this.</p>

<p>Why is it that no other major power has been threatened by the borg? The only encounter that the Romulans seemed to have with the Borg is mentioned in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Neutral_Zone_%28TNG_episode%29_56ac.html" title="The Neutral Zone (TNG episode)">The Neutral Zone</a> and then, only outposts were destroyed. The Federation seems to be the only entity that is outright attacked by the borg. The same goes for the Dominion. The Dominion is such a huge territory, I find it hard to believe that the Borg have no interest in it. The technological level of the Dominion is not that much greater than the Federation either, if at all. Again, I think it is unlikely that the Borg would have no interest in the Dominion.
