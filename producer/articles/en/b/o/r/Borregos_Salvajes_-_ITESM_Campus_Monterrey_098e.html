<p>American Football has been always linked to the ITESM. It was the first sport which was practiced in this institution. For more than 50 years, ITESM American football team has had remarkable performance and had given recognition to its undergraduated and graduated students.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borregos_Salvajes_-_ITESM_Campus_Monterrey_098e.html" title="Edit section: Tradition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tradition</span></h2>
<p>The tradition of practicing this sport at the ITESM began back then in 1945 when the institution assigned to Alexander Solis Carranco, who was an American footbal player and trainer, the task of creating and training a American footbal squad. The training began with a game explanation and a physical training program which consisted of basic exercises such as calisthenics, run practice, passes, and scrimmages. The team in that time was formed by 14 players and within an era of double power, all were playing defensive and offensive roles and they were made hold the action all the match until some was hurt. In spite of the initial pesimism by the robust stranger and of the nature of the sport, the players were excited by the game and after 5 or 5 training sessions the first game was proposed to be against the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León. This match meant the beginning for traditional Classic Match Borregos-Tigres (Tigres is the UANL American football team, a state managed institution) and up to date this match is famously followed by American football fans from Monterrey.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borregos_Salvajes_-_ITESM_Campus_Monterrey_098e.html" title="Edit section: Uniform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Uniform</span></h2>
<p>For their first match it was necessary to uniform the players, their jerseys were originally supposed to be made in red with white covers. Unfortunately, the supplier did not have enough red fabric to make those uniforms. Coach Solis had to choose another color of which the supplier had enough fabric. He chose the blue one because it was the color of the bus in which the team was traveling. Since then, the uniform was a blue jersey with a letter "T" in front, and in the back was the player's number. After that the institute chose blue and white as their official colors.</p>
<p>The selection of the mascot was equally accidental. On the way to the park Cuauhtémoc and Famosa, where the first Classic Match (derby) would take place, the players had the restlessness to have a mascot to identify them. They passed by a ford, today Santa Catarina River, and saw a man feeding a ram. They bought it for 25 pesos and thus the mascot arose from the equipment that represents the Institute.</p>
