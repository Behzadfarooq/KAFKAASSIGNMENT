<p>I’ve inserted a new image to satisfy the request that the former fair use image should be replaced with a freely licensable one. I contacted Boris Johnson’s e-mail address to receive, as I said in my e-mail, <i>a freely licensable picture of yourself for use on Wikipedia</i>. I received the simple response (from Melissa Crawshay-Williams Private Sec to Boris Johnson MP, copied and pasted from e-mail), <i>yes sure</i>, and an e-mail attached image - Image:BorisJohnsonemail.jpg. I presume that the wording of the e-mail allows this image to be considered <i>freely licensable</i>, but I’m not sure. Could somebody help me here?

<p>Boris Johnson did not have an affair with Petronella Wyatt and I personally feel it to be an insult to him when this article refers to him as lying about the affair. There was no affair, just attention seeking by certain people and lesser beings trying to bring Boris down. He did not lie and for this article to claim he did shows how opinions are morphed into facts by the media.-A SOURCE</p>

<p>This "member of parliament" writes a book about what it means to be British whilst "having a hand" in a disgusting ED piece critising people from Liverpool for "not admitting" they were responsible for Hillsborough. He wasn't writing for The Sun newspaper, no, they were far more evil and sadistic in their coverage, (being tacky and vile is their maxim). But he's an author of what it means to be British, his books published by Harper Collins, part of News Corporation. A Murdoch Shill? Smells like it. I remember Hillsborough, and someone should remind snotty nose about what it meant to be British that fateful day. Images of people being crushed to death put aside even hardened rivalries. Not playing "the blame game" to sell more papers! It sums it up for an MP with a BBC docu (how do they manage it) comparing the old Roman empire with the new dream Roman empire, "how new Rome can learn from old Rome" Sounds like social engineering at play, advocating a policy of compromise. Of course these social engineers will focus only on the positive aspects of Roman culture, if there are any! They got their kicks from bloodsports too! Slavery! Laws biased to the priviledged! Mob rule! The cult of emperor worship! Persecuting christians who held that Jesus, not Caesar, was Lord!</p>

<p>I might be missing something here, I confess, but: who really cares how he did in some stupid university election? Especially since he lost? In the grander scheme of things, it's hardly going to rate a big mention is it? There is barely any mention of any single <i>parliamentary</i> election he has ever stood in, so what makes this one so special? <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:39, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. The edit has been reverted more than 3 times, so should there be a request for arbitration on the matter? In my opinion, the election is completely trivial, all-but forgotten about by now, and not deserving of a pretty lengthy entry on this page. Especially the voting statistics - these are not encyclopaedic. The addition of the text appears to be politically-motivated and in bad faith. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 00:13, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, I'm not a student activist, and if you check my IP address, you will see I am in the US. I don't see the logic in continually deleting it, saying it is excessive and trivial while leaving things in like HIGNFY, what frat club he was a member of at Oxford and particularly the recently added info about a charity soccer match which contains an exceedingly tedious minute by minute account which has little to do with Johnson's life and work. The reasons why I feel the Edinburgh election should be included is because it is a relatively recent event, it is directly relevant to Johnson's current job in the Shadow cabinet and it reveals a very insightful, relevant and interesting account of his behavior, political stance and personality. I heard about the University election in the British press soon after it happened and I simply can't understand why it shouldn't be included in here just because a small number of people arrogantly assume no one reading this would be interested. Edinburgh is one of the UK's most prestiguous schools and Johnson currently formulates policies that would affect millions of students attending UK institutions. If you feel there's hardly anything about national election here, why not do some research and include information on Johnson's action during them too? Standing for elections is what politicians do and just because Johnson did so at one of the UK's largest Universities doesn't mean it is not worth describing here.</dd>

<dd>As for the jibe about edits to other MPs' pages, I've made changes to the pages about MPs of all parties, yet it seems to be the Conservative ones that objections are raised when something remotely critical is left about them. The David Cameron article is the prime example: it is considered POV to point out it was the shortest Budget response in history (which I heard on the BBC, an news source legally obliged to be impartial) yet the apparently self-appointed moderators on here think it's perfectly fair and balanced to say the misbehavior was all done by representatives of only one party when it is clear from the video of the speech that is impossible to tell exacly which group of MPs are making the noise. The nature of the House of Commons is the noise and rowdiness comes from all sides no matter the occasion.</dd>

<p>we could debate long into the night on the significance of this, but for my part your inference that the result of some studfent election has some deeper implication for the community view of Boris Johnson, thereby giving it special notoriety, is <b>clearly</b> original research. If you can adduce some evidence (perhaps a national newspaper saying this, or somehing) it might be different. In any case, here's a compromise: I've removed the section, and made a very brief mention of the electoral result under "politics". Given the weighting of the rest of the article the remainder really isn't that interesting vis-a-vis Boris specifically (or, frankly, at all - but I defer to your concerns), so I have included that under the entry for the Rectorial Elections. There is a link from this article so anyone who really feels the need can go look there.</p>
<p>As for the footie match and HIGNFY - whether you think these are <i>worthy</i> of or <i>justify</i> notability is beside the point: they <b>are</b> important reasons for notability, being events fo the type that, in large part, what makes BJ the notable figure he is (failing the Rectorial Elections really isn't), and they are thus worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 09:18, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The material in the Rector election section is far from Original Research. If you look at it, you will notice that the assertions in it are backed up with linked references. It is not "some student election", it was at Edinburgh University, the largest University in Scotland and one of the largest in the UK with 24,000 UK and international students, many of whom come from the Conservative heartlands of the south of England and has a world wide reputation. It was not just the students who voted in the rectorial election, the university staff can too, from the cleaners to heads of academic departments. It was a result of Boris' notable status that he was invited and nominated to stand in the election and the events described are consistent with what is described else where on this page. If he had not appeared on HIGNFY or the charity match, he would still have his 'lovable buffoon' reputation and his conduct during the rector election fits in with this reputation and as such, is worthy of description on his biog page on Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>Right, we need to stop this <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a> immediately. The reversions are now totally in breach of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a>, so we need to enter some sort of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. Negotiation on this talk page clearly has not achieved consensus, evidenced by the ongoing dispute, so I suggest the first thing is to take a <a href="../../../s/t/r/WP%7ESTRAW_60a4.html" title="WP:STRAW">straw poll</a> to see if we can reach agreement by voting which everyone will abide by. Policy says we must reach a consensus first on the nature of the question; how about: "Dispute regarding insertion of text regarding Edinburgh University Rector election. Consensus sought as to whether the text in question is appropriate for inclusion in the article." Alternatively, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">mediation</a> might be required. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 21:40, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>er, not wishing to be pedantic, but I don't think anyone <i>is</i> in breach of the three revert rule. That requires <i>one</i> user to revert three times <i>in a single 24 hour period</i>. I don't think that's happened. In any case, personally, I'm bored with the argument, which is characterised by the usual immaturity and petulance (from everyone except me&#160;:)) - I think all the perspectives have come out on the talk page, so someone important ought to be able to read the discussion and say "you're right, that <i>is</i> totally non-notable, delete. Or maybe we just put it to a vote or something? Or perhaps those who really do give a flying crap about whether or not BoJo contested or lost the stupid election can just keep reverting each other periodically. It's not really doing any harm, and it's probably just helping to work out some much needed testosterone in the student common rooms up there in Edinburgh. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:31, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No 3rr rule violation because anonymous has resorted to sock puppets.

<dd>Short of a permanent semi-protection there really isn't anything we can do. A lone anonymous editor who switchs IP addresses to make occassion major edits against the consensus due to their political beliefs is unlikely to stop. This isn't a major problem, so unless it becomes a nuisance I suggest we wait it out. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 12:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A few words in favour of keeping the section on the rectorial elections. This is considered notable in the UK and is covered by the national press. Previous rectors have included, for example, Gladstone, Kitchener and Churchill. The election is probably one of the most democratic in the UK: anyone can be nominated (except for matriculated students or staff of the University) and all the staff and students can vote. The person stands as themself, not as a representative of a political party. I am quite sure Johnson whould have taken it as much more of a personal accolade if he had won that election than he did on being elected as the tory MP for Henley (where the populace would elect a donkey, if it was a Conservative). He took the campaign seriously (or at least his own eccentric version of seriousness) - see, for example, the boris4rector.com website. I'm not planning on editing the article either way but I would argue strongly in favour of keeping the section. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 08:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes he has noted it in editorials and the like for some time. He is often attacked on it because of the whole asylum/immigration and the Coservative parties attempts to work out an angle on it (i.e. Boris doesn't support immigration, but if it were not for it he wouldn't be here etc etc). This is (possibly) why he supports asylum (at least) so strongly. <a href="../../../p/y/d/User%7EPydos_3460.html" title="User:Pydos">Pydos</a> 08:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've pulled the following passage from the Politics section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he was three times refused the opportunity to speak in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> during a debate on Scottish affairs (where he was sitting as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_bencher.html" title="Back bencher">back bencher</a>), before he walked out in disgust.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's no independent report of this event, suggesting that it is not notable.</li>
<li>There was no <b>debate</b> on Scottish affairs on that day (source: <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?d=2006-11-07" class="external text" title="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?d=2006-11-07" rel="nofollow">They Work For You</a>) There were Scottish <b>Questions</b>, a difference great enough to require correction.</li>
<li>The lead paragraph states that Johnson is a frontbencher. Were this paragraph to return, it would be necessary to resolve the contradiction.</li>
<li>"Walked out in disgust" appears to give a point of view.</li>
</ol>
<p>I welcome rationales to restore this passage. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 09:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
