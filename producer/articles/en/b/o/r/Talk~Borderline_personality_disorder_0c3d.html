<p>In the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, it was claimed that some people thought him to have a Narcissistic or Paranoid personality.

<p>what does narcessistic or paranoid personality disoders have to do with borderline personality disorder? are you suggesting that he also had that? if not, why are you mentioning it on this page? do you have any proof that he had it? if not, then it isnt relevant. posthumous analysis is not valid. olayak</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point about Nixon is relevant to an earlier discussion on this page about posthumous classification of personality. I didn't say anything about Nixon having BPD. Posthumous classification is valid, as long as it's done thoroughly and objectively. Personality disorders other than Borderline have been discussed or at least mentioned on this page before and there's no reason why it can't be discussed now.<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeelin_10ed.html" title="User:Geelin">Geelin</a> 01:43, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"If a patient with BPD has co-morbid factors of substance abuse (alcohol or other drugs), the risk factor reaches an astounding 58% dying from suicide within five years." That certainly is astounding. I added the "citation needed" tag to this line. It reminds me of one of my favorite jokes: 43% of all statistics are made up on the spot. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertAustin_6480.html" title="User:RobertAustin">RobertAustin</a> 11:55, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added a lot of information this afternoon, but much of it was gathered from medical article abstracts archived at PubMed. This is the best kind of resource, especially the reviews and controlled studies I tracked down. HOWEVER, the links look really nasty down in the reference box. How can I improve the look without having two webpages, going back and forth, picking out disjoined bits - journal name, date, number and volume .. list of authors (often very long), title (often long), and the university hospital that sponsored the study. Can I do something like a "Pub-Med Abstract", work it somehow so that citation mark-up?? One way or another, I want poeple to be able to click through and read it themselves. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 00:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, have alook now -looks nicer. Is this what you had (have done #17 &amp; 18). NB: 17 is not something to get too excited about researchwise and is not a landmark paper. A much better place for Evidence is the Cochrane collaboration <a href="http://www.cochrane.org" class="external free" title="http://www.cochrane.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.cochrane.org</a></dd>

<dd>Oh Cas, they look terrific!! Thanks so much. Now I can examine the markup and then fix the other ones (tomorrow!). Okay about #17. I will read at Cochrane.org and then go looking for much better research papers. Thanks for helpie a newbie.</dd>

<dd>Yep, I can see a lot of tidying up which this article certainly needs. The medication bit is very tricky and some of the stuff you have removed is relevant. Antipsychotics have a much firmer use in schizophrenia as dopamine and serotonin blocking agents - they have been used mainly for behavioural control and brief psychotic episodes in BPD. The removal of text suggests the drugs are a mainstay of treatment, which they aren't (though can be very helpful). I think adding the bit back with a bit of wording and a citation needed is helpful. One also has to be sceptical of some studies.</dd>

<dd>Similarly with bit on mood stabilisers - which I will look at soon.</dd>

<dd>As for anti-psychotics. I HATE to see them prescribed for anyone who can be managed on anything else at all, alone or in combos. In my opinion, it is so wrong for doctors to take the leap from a trial on lithium and Dapakote straight to antipsychotics. In Great Britain, LAMICTAL is considered the very first med to be tried instead of those cheapies like I mentioned.</dd>

<p><b>Old section:</b> <i>Patients with borderline personality disorder are at very high risk of suicide, about 5-10% or about 500 to 1000 times more than the general population. This risk greatly escalates when other co-morbid factors are present. The disorder is often poorly understood by psychiatrists and some psychiatrists simply refuse to accept BPD patients due to their instability (missed appointments, difficulty dealing with them). If a patient with BPD has co-morbid factors of substance abuse (alcohol or other drugs), the risk factor reaches an astounding 58% dying from suicide within five years.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span>citation needed<i>]</i></a></sup></i></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that the mention of "some psychiatrists simply refuse to accept" will be removed from this suicide part. Although this is partially true (BPD interpersonal relations are often unstable), I doubt the refusal of mental health professionals would be the reason or cause for high mortility in BPD. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalind_0241.html" title="User:Jalind">Jalind</a> 22:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems that above mentioned information comes from Stone M (or MH?), published in book chapter <i>"The course of borderline personality disorder"</i> (1989; <i>Stone found a suicide rate of 45 percent when alcohol abuse, borderline personality disorder and major affective disorder coexisted. .. The suicide rate of those presenting for treatment is 10 percent.</i>) and article <i>"Paradoxes in the management of suicidality in borderline patients"</i> (1993; American Journal of Psychotherapy 1993; 47:255-272). But my source is second hand. Also IMHO these sources are getting a bit outdated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also there is more recent review-article: <i>"Pompili M, Girardi P, Ruberto A, Tatarelli R. Suicide in borderline personality disorder: A meta-analysis. Nord J Psychiatry 2005;59:319-234."</i> which migh be useful. They tell that (see table 1 text): Expected suicides in a year in 100000 individuals would be averagely 898 if they all suffered from BPD, compared to average 16.6 general population of same size (thus 898 / 16.6 = 54 time more often?). I feel a bit stupid, but somehow their results are hard to interpret. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalind_0241.html" title="User:Jalind">Jalind</a> 22:30, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK - neuroleptics = antipsychotics</p>
<p>strictly speaking, when we say mood stabilisers we refer to lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine - all of which require blood monitoring, all can cause a rash and various other side effects.</p>
<p>Some antipsychotics can be, broadly speaking, mood stabilisers but given there is a neuroleptic heading they are better discussed there. Actually, antipsychotic is a better name than neuroleptic. Also, one has more chance of getting tardive dyskinesia with lithium and an antipsychotic together. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 10:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, neuroleptics ARE antipsychotics, and the use of both is not a negative for an encyclopedia article, as long as the reader understands they refer to the same kind of drug.</p>
<p>NO NO NO. Lamictal doesn't have blood levels drawn. No matter how much, no matter how long. I would ask for your citation. (<i>I'll get back to you on that one</i>)<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 13:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And the Lamictal "rash" is not AT ALL like the types of rashed common to allergies or to Lithium (where it is a acne type break out, not an itch). It is simplistic overkill to lump all so-called rashes into one great heap. I would ask for your citation. (<i>I'm not lumping <b>all</b> rashes, just that carbamazepine and valproate can have <b>serious</b> problems as well. I didn't mean to trivialise lamictal</i>)</p>
<p>And all the psychiatrists I happen to know consider ANY DRUG THAT STABILIZES MOOD SWINGS to be a "Mood Stabilizer". Perhaps the entire medication categories deserve a rethink. (<i>OK, will check consensus on that - yep, many categories are arbitary that is true</i>)</p>
<p>Antidepressants are not mood stabilizers. Tranquilizers are not mood stabilizers. But Lithium, Neuroleptics, valproate and anti-seizure medications are mood stabilizers. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 11:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(<i>neuroleptics can be mood stabilisers but that is not their primary function but a (distant) secondary one</i>)</p>
<p><br />
As to a lithium/neuroleptic combo resulting in a higher incidence of tardive dyskinesia, I would as for your citation. This may very well be true, but I want to see it for myself. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 11:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC) (<i>comin' right up</i>)<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 13:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel that there is an over-reliance of Cochrane's limited literture reviews. Only 4 papers on Borderline, And, whether supported by Cochrane or not (I found their conclusions to be very non-commital for the most part), it seems they are being used to support all or nothing points of view that are very anti-psychiatry and anti-meds.</p>
<p>(<i>Cochrane is highly regarded as a research collaboration trying to review RCTs in meta-analyses. It is often non-committal because the evidence is equivocal. Because they only look at RCTs alot of data is excluded. Alot of their other material does recognise the benefits of various medicines&#160;:)</i><a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 14:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I remember back, not that many years ago, where there was a virtual minority of one doctor in Florida breaking revolutionary ground in treating what he called "biological unhappiness" in his borderline patients. Nowadays, not only is it accepted and acted upon that a BPD's emotional distress and dysfunction can be alleviated. Additionally, quality of life and ability to be gainfully employed and a participating member of the community can be markedly enhanced. It is increasingly suspected by researchers that bipolar disorder and the so-called borderline personality disorder are closely related. As more brain scans and MRIs and such are done, the differences and similarities can be mapped and analyzed, and eventually scientists will have a firmer grasp.</p>
<p>(<i>I have no problem with epidemiological links with BPD, Major Depression and bipolar. I also have no problem with a biological basis for BPD. If you google Allan Schore there is a load of stuff about early trauma leading to serotonin abnormalities. He did a particular paper in 2003 but I can't find the #$#$# reference at the moment, which also explains why SSRIs work well.</i>)</p>
<p>By definition, personality disoders are static, unyielding, unchanging grossly dsyfunctional personalities. If a so-called personality-disordered person improves, really changes, then that is proof that they never had what psychiatry recognizes as a disordered personality. It has been common for disorders of personality and character to slip in and out of the DSM. PDs have been a major sticking point in getting the DSM-V published, having already made it 2 years late in its release.</p>
<p>(<i>People are adaptive, there is research by McGlashan which shows 2 out of 3 people with BPD improve significantly over time - it is a 1985 or 86 study and should be referenced here somehwere. If you google it it will come up. Static is not a good word, longitudinal yes but people are adaptive.</i>)</p>
<p>Getting back to this article not having a neutral point of view, it is not for an encyclopedia to preach and reinforce a point of view held by only a segment of society or a profession. It is not for us to influence the reader to believe that medicine for the disorder is good or is bad. It is not for us to influence the reader by misleading them in how the treatment of BPD is or is not changing. No matter how emotionally invested you are in pushing therapy over meds, it is pushing a point of view, and that cannot be allowed. You must stop deleting material that offends you personally. All that matters is whether or not it is supported by the literature and well-accepted and acted upon by a preponderance of psychiatrists. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 12:56, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I spent considerable time earlier writing some extended thoughts about the graceful and thorough integration of other POVs into the article. And then I come back to see if I had any responses.. and find that it's not here. Again, I must have forgotten to switch from the preview screen to the publish screen. I lost it all. So, nothing to do but try it again.</p>
<p>I had written about how it is VERY important for ALL opposing and divergent points of view on such a volatile diagnosis in such a state of diagnostic flux. But here is what I propose as I have seen it done to excellent effect elsewhere, textbooks et al.</p>
<p>The one thing we all must get away from immediately is sprinkling opposing POVs hither and yon, especially within the treatment areas, but also in etiology and even diagnosis. Some opposing points of view, the NO MEDS - ONLY THERAPY is one thing which should had its very own sub-category (under treatments) - AND there should be subcategory to links that support this point of view, including support groups.</p>
<p>Again, in those sections that are detailing the prevailing psychiatric psychotropic approach, whether with or without directional therapy, should be allowed to fully put forward what is known to be true about these medications, both positive and negative. But statements such as "meds aren't used" is ridiculous in this present day and have no part of an up to date encyclopedia entry. BUT, in its own opposing POV section, it can advocate for this point IF one can find professional citations decrying the use of meds and advocating only unsupported psychotherapies.</p>
<p>If this article is to go anywhere as a featured article candidate (and I presume some of you out there have been around a long time and are very invested in this outcome), then we must all bite the bullet and pull together to produce an exquisitely well written, tightly stitched together, and impressive presentation of the topic.</p>
<p>The treatment category, the meds section, will have to have some re-organizationsl work to bring it into a sensible presentation of psychopharmacotherapy. I will change the OUTLINE (only the outline) on the page so you can visualize what I am talking about. This is not a dictate, but a vision. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 12:22, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Draft looks really good, much better than the text on the page currently. Most psychiatrists advocate the uses of various agents as you've outlined.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Incidentally Anorexia is classically related to more obsessive personalities and bulimia to the cluster B group. If the use of meds is described as outlined then I don't really think that a no meds section is needed, or something under general treatment heading like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some people with BPD elect to not use medications. Reasons may be varied, from sensitivity to the medications' side effects to intrapsychic issues about what being reliant on a medication means to them. (A medication may have complex meaning for these people)</i></dd>

Thank you for filling me in on the eating disorder thing and other things you have taken the time to explain to me. As I learn, I can refine that outline.

<p>I just want to put these up for discussion.</p>
<p>First, I have primarily encountered this disorder in the literature (and in documentation) abbreviated an BoPD or BOPD rather than BPD, with the intent of removing confusion with Bipolar Disorder, which is abbreviated as BPD. I would like to hear others' opinions on adopting this abbreviation. It seems to me that since "BPD" is ambiguous it should probably be avoided.</p>
<p>Second: The line "The Scientists also believe that BPD is genetic. Approximately 35% of children whose parents have BPD will show signs of the disorder" should be modified to soften the assertion "BPD is genetic" to something like "may have a genetic component". The bare assertion "is genetic" is hopelessly oversimplified:</p>
<ul>
<li>It suggests that some heritable trait causes the disorder in isolation from environmental influence, when in fact this is not known or even believed to be the case, and there is probably considerable interaction between inherited traits (diathesis) and environmental influences (stress).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A 0.35 correlation between a parent's diagnosis and the child's <i>diagnosis</i> would be food for thought -- especially in a study of children reared by others than the borderline parent(s) -- but not conclusive. But to "show signs of" the disorder is not the same as to "have" the disorder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It glosses over the fact that BOPD cases can arise without any familial history of mental illness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It ignores the fact that a child raised in a household with borderline parents is far more likely than others to be exposed to borderline behaviours, emotional dysregulation, parental withdrawal, abuse, and/or invalidation, all of which are held to have aetiological significance.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general note, any attempt to ascribe <i>any</i> complex behavioural pattern to genetic determination in any simple way is an very heavy claim that requires very heavy evidence.</p>
<p>Third, there is considerable controversy within psychiatry about this disorder. Some psychiatrists dismiss its very reality; others believe that while it is a real disorder, it is overdiagnosed; still others believe that the "borderline" label is vaguely defined and used as a wastebaket into which difficult patients are tossed ("difficult patient syndrome"). Others are highly concerned about labelling effects. I see nothing about this controversy in this article. Would anyone object to its inclusion?--7Kim 20:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you about the wording of the (possible) genetic component; any combination of genetics and psychiatry is in danger of being over-simplified, and needs careful wording.</dd>
<dd>About the controversy surrounding BPD, it should probably have its own passage in the article, if you can find reliable medical sources for each of the various POVs you mentioned. Citation is especially important when it comes to dissent in the medical community.</dd>
<dd>As to the abbreviation, I really don't know. *Shrugs* <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 10:08, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far as the abbreviation goes, the theoretical literature is inconsistent and I have not been able to discover an authoritative source that "lays down the law", if you will. I <i>do</i> know that in psychiatric practise the abbreviations "BD" and "BoPD" are used for bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder respectively and the abbreviation "BPD" is deprecated as ambiguous. Actually, that is, I think, a good enough statement right there. I'll edit that in, and I think it will stand challenge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 7Kim (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_7Kim_2ed4.html" title="Special:Contributions/7Kim">contribs</a>) 17:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I am a bit surprised to see this popular press book being used as an authoritative text here. I would prefer to see some good journal literature reviews of the use of ADs in borderlines.</p>
<p>In addition, children, teens and young adults are now the specific identified populations more likely to have suicide attempts in the early weeks of treatment, while older adults do not show this propensity. Of course, the rate of suicide attempts is, still, MUCH LOWER than would be present in untreated depression. If there is considerable independent statistical data showing specific differences in BPDs, let's present it.</p>
<p>If this article is to promote the notion of ADs being dangerous, it MUST have the ENTIRE picture represented. And, of course, the entire subtopic needs citations. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 05:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been "hanging out" at BPD and BD forums for some years now, and within patient populations, those are the exclusively used abbreviations for BPD and BD. It is vital that BPD NOT be used for Bipolar, because then there is too much confusion since it would too easily be sorted into the PD pile since you can't expect people to recognize that you are splitting one word into "two words."</p>
<p>Additionally, whether you google or check for acronyms, you get Barrels of Oil per Day. Seems best to stay away from such a little known acronym</p>

<dd>I noted above that BOPD is sometimes used, especially by clinicians, to distinguish borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder. A little further digging shows that the current standard <i>is</i> BPD for borderline personality disorder and BD for bipolar disorder, and BOPD passed out of favour eight or ten years ago (an abnormal-psych textbook, published eight years ago, is the latest "official" use of "BoPD" I could find, and it listed both), even though for purposes of strict unambiguity in such areas as medical documentation it might be preferable. Apparently the reasoning was to reserve "PD" for "personality disorder", which makes good sense. So the article <i>should</i> use BPD. Still, a caution to the reader that the acronyms may vary or be misused seems in order. --7Kim 23:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two cents — Make sure the relevant disambig pages have the distinctions, and include the material that such abbreviation nomenclature is in an evolving state. // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 18:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the overall outline has signifant built-in room for presenting the various theories -- but I do hope that it is CLEAR throughout that most researchers consider certain populations for being more at risk for BPD and PTSD. There is, it is presently believed, to be correlated to a genetic propensity.</p>
<p>If anyone around here recalls, there is a research psychiatrist at one of a pediatric medical school department in Dallas Texas (think it is Southwestern) who published longitudial research back in 2000 or 2001 about PTSD in childhood being very strongly correlated with the diagnosis of BPD as the children grew older. Hopefully that is still published online.</p>
<p>I have heard here that SOME BPDs are considered "pure BPDs" as they do not respond (or respond only partially) to medications, only therapies... But I can tell you relatively authoritatively that there are bipolars that never manage to get good to excellent results with meds.</p>
<p>Building on this is that it is common in a minority of bipolars for medications do not "last" forever. There is a school of thought that the brain "adapts" to the "new normal" induced by medications. The theory proposes that the brain (ANYONE's brain) struggles to regain "its OWN normal" and thus the brain chemistry is eventually changed back to its former balances.</p>
<p>If this is here again (still), we need to see citations for it and for the two other possiblities being presented... --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 05:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing that jumped out at me in my first read of the article was that certain linkages are suspected, but not differentiated as being so. The section on the prevalance of suicidal tendencies comes to mind. There is no mention that there may be a disconnect, and that such people may also be suffering from clinical depression. In other words, such co-diagnoses are not uncommon and even likely, and this needs some careful handling.

<dd>Unrelated to that, I may as well take the opportunity to mention that I think the 1st &amp; 2nd paragraphs of the intro could be combined, and the 3rd revised to cover both the proposed PTSD and Bipolar connections and mention other proposed aspects of etiology such as genetics. I'm also planning to remove the 'psychological roots' bullet-pointed bits as seeming informal/psychoanalytic without source (e.g. project on to) and because it says people with BPD often think they are fundamentally bad or unworthy but then itself describes them as having "inner self deficiencies"... I think the psychotherapy subsections below that need sorting. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 17:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as a BPD - bipolar link, this is not something which should occur in the intro as it is not a core issue. By all means a discussion later on somewhere is fine.

<dd>What do you mean it's not a core issue? It's a huge issue concerning BPD. Discernment between the two, misdiagnosis, reluctant diagnosis because BPD is an axis-II condition, which insurance companies don't like much. It should at least be mentioned, because the behaviors of both can be mixed up even by a person that knows what to look for. Speedemon86 20:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't have the Managed Care/Insurance problems here in Australia, so in terms of coverage this isn't as big an issue. Also, since many public health centres are running DBT groups, there is less marginalisation of BPD than there was 10 years ago.

<p>Maybe the best way to go is to archive much of the talk page and do a really focussed overhaul (if needed) section by section, starting with the intro, and then nominating for FA. The article will continually be tampered with but if FA will give a much better platform to conserve a particular format. There seem to be a bunch of determined editors making real progress and I don't think it is that far off FAC (it is comprehensive, I think the intro is about right in terms of length and content).</p>
<p>The other reason I think the time is good now is things can so easily go off the boil and folk can focus elsewhere. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 01:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS:Meant to add that BPD is an emotionally laden issue much like many others on wikipedia where there are always going to be strong opinions. I think getting an FA on this would be a major and noteworthy achievement due ti the controversial nature of the topic (unlike, say, a football team or pokemon etc. Not that I have anything against pokemon.......;) ) <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 01:20, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cas, I fully agree with you about archiving this page and doing the section by section discussion. I also agree with you about the bipolar stuff not belonging in the intro (and if it was me who put it there, I apologize), but I do believe that my "contributions" were mainly confined to separating what was already here into various "piles of paper", then sorting them into a logical progression of topics. While our unknown guest thinks otherwise, if you pick up any professional text on BPD, all these topics will be covered. HAVE to be covered if anyone is to be fully informed about what the disorder is (or is not) about.</dd>

<p>OK folks are we happy with the intro? This is the place for discussion on length; same length/longer/shorter and anything else to be added or subtracted from it.

<dd>I only mentioned the bipolar issue because at the moment the 2nd para says only that BPD is seen as a "particular manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder". Whilst I don't disagree, it is also commonly seen as being on a <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_spectrum.html" title="Bipolar spectrum">bipolar spectrum</a> due to things like mood changeability and interpersonal issues etc, and of course BPD onset isn't always associated to experience of trauma.

<dd>I think that the introduction should be limited purely to defining the disorder and perhaps discussing its relation to common society (i.e. what is means in common parlance). Any theorized connections (be it to PTSD or bipolar) might be best off in another section, perhaps at the same place that discusses the chance of another disorder occuring with BPD. /2¢ —<a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">K</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_Esperanza_a49d.html" title="User:Keakealani/Esperanza"><font color="#2F690D">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">akealani</font></a> 07:49, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree this should be addressed in the main body of the article.

<dd>I don't disagree Cas Liber &amp; please feel free to re-edit anything I do of course.

<dd>How's this? Totally agree about the overlap now that I look at it properly. According to the MOS an articel this length should have 2 or more likely 3 paras which mention the key points which are expanded upon later.

<dd>Did you see that I have proposed a totally new section called "The Chances for Recovery"... taking out of the "treatment &amp; recovery" title... as a discussion of therapies is really an area to deal with the concept of recovery.

Plus, what impact is associated with teaching loved ones about their roles and how to change former harmful or even destructive patterns of response.</dd>

<dd>I have read the overview of Mood Stabilizers over and over. It does cover the topic well, I think, but as always I wish the names of specific medications could be reserved for the subtopics below it. But that will come with time. for the moment, it is okay.</dd>

<dd>Lithium is still the most widely used mood stabilizers in the world, is valuable as a dual-function drug, and has a unique method of action. It does, in other words, need to be featured in its own subtopic MUCH MORE that Depakote does. True, Depakote is usually the second drug to be added to Lithium or substituted for Lithium, but again that because of the low cost of both. Depakote is, in the final analysis, simply one more of the antiseizure meds. I feel very strongly about this issue, regarding the importance of lithium and that Depakote can be shooed into its proper category. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 13:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Frank.. Yep, Lithium is an elephant gun. First thing most docs try you on (better, I think, than going to an atypical antipsychotic!!). I did VERY well on an old tricyclic AD -Desipramine. Still recommended, but has strong anti-cholinergic side-effects. Used it, sole therapy, for 7-8 continuous years. And I've been on Prozac, Zoloft and Wellbutrin. I would only recommend Paxil for my worst enemies - coming off that is, apparently, a true nightmare (maybe not for everyone). I tend to switch among ADs and to tweak my doses. BPDs and BDs have to become full partners with their docs - and their docs have to trust their patients' feedback and judgement. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 11:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

ThanQ, I've put it back in, reworded. Changed the subheadings a bit while I was at it. I found a paragraph regarding mental health services that also used to be in the article:</p>
<p>"Patients often need extensive mental health services, and they account for 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations.(Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR. Treatment histories of borderline inpatients. Comprehensive Psychiatry, in press.) It is recognised that they often receive poor service, however, in part due to lack of sympathy with or understanding of self-harm, impulsivity or so-called 'non-compliance'"</p>

<p>I get a message that the article is long. The most straightforward to move is the section on Non-BPD which could go on a separate page with a 1 or 2 line summary here.

<dd>As I browse quickly, I'm inclined to say that the treatment sections are the largest, and although it would take quite a bit of reworking I think it would be plausible to create another article called something like Treatments of borderline personality disorder. Unsure of how that would be received - I realise it's an integral part of the article, but it's also the largest, and theoretically, the article should focus more on what the disorder is, not how to get rid of it. —<a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">K</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_Esperanza_a49d.html" title="User:Keakealani/Esperanza"><font color="#2F690D">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">akealani</font></a> 06:50, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Keakealani. Since the treatments for Bipolar and Borderline PD are identical, this does present problems - The Bipolar article is as long as this one is, yet has virtually ZERO coverage of treatments. And it would cause an outrage against many Borderlines to be referred to a page entitled "Treatments for BPD and BD" -- but then again, we could scarcely have two identical articles with nothing different but the names at the top. I have a (long) series of thoughts about this at the bottom of this topic section. apologies - forgot to sign - Kiwi 26 December 2006</dd>

<p>It seems to me that maybe some of the pharmacological information is superfluous to an article on BPD (though vital to any articles on the specific drugs where it should be moved) like the lengthy section on side effects, and some of it is unfortunately expressed as personal opinion. Perhaps it could be ruthlessly pruned back to cited, specific and neutral information?</p>
<p>I have just tried an experiment in placing some sections that need serious pruning inline to see what effect it has...reversion of any, or all (except the requests for citation, for FA status they are essential or the related text must go) will not offend. Might be a technique to experiment with other text that may be superfluous? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 10:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cas liber ... You said that someone told you the article was long? Did they say it was "too long" or just "long". If you go look at Bipolar, for instance, it is as long as this article is. Look at others, and there are many even longer. Even longer than many talk page at WP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing to consider, with all the indexing to make this article user-friendly, we have a lot of headers that take up room. Remove a lot of them, and you immensely "shorten" the article -at least the LOOK of the article. But should we remove headers to make it LOOK shorter? I don't think that would be helpful.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But I, too, was looking at what could be overlap, things that could go elsewhere.... so...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I went looking for the Mood Stablizer article. And it was dreadfully inadequate. But I began considering that once we produce a good section on Mood Stabilizers, we could merge the two articles and with only a brief coverage of Mood Stabilizers in this BPD article, we could then provide a link to the vastly improved topic page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With Antidepressants, that article has absolutely ZERO coverage of how ADs virtually always provoke a Manic response in Bipolars and Borderlines if not conjointly administered with a sufficiently strong dose of Mood Stabilizer. This Manic response can often push the patient into a frank manic psychosis that necessitates hospitalization. The AD article strongly needs a Subtopic specific for BPD &amp; BP.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So I went looking at the Bipolar Disorder Article. This time, I found virtually ZERO regarding the topic of treatment. Here again, that article could strongly benefit with a sub-subtopic on medications, with links to vastly improved Mood Stabilizer and Antidepressant articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what we have are THREE articles (AD, BP &amp; Mood Stabilizers) that need to have what we are building here. But to expect us here to suddenly try dividing our attentions among 4 articles would, I think, cause this one to suffer greatly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, I would SUGGEST that we consider doing our work here, then we can EXPORT our labors to the other articles, thereby improving all of them at once.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, we could not export anything at the moment without having it deleted overnight for lack of citations. So, I suggest, one step at a time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>HOWEVER: If we are going to toss out most of the medication sections out of this article, then it only stands to reason that we must also toss out most of the Psychotherapy sections, too, and after a short discussion, just put in links to the wiki topics that cover each type of therapy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why do I say that? When borderlines DO get medical attention for their symptoms, they are very likely to get medication, but only very rarely do they get to ever sit in an office with a psychotherapist. <i>This is due mostly to lack of adequate insurance coverage for psychiatric disorders. Most policies still mandate no more than 12 sessions per year (15 minutes long) with a psychiatrist for "med checks". Even "good" policies that provide for psychotherapy seldom allow for weekly appointments, maxing out at two a month.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact of the matter is, treatment is both very complicated and very vital to both BPDs &amp; Bipolars if they are to be able to well integrate into society, be able to get and hold down a GOOD job (ie, one with good insurance benefits), and improve and maintain good interpersonal relationships. So if we aren't able and willing to cover these subjects here, we MUST ensure that the wiki linked pages do.</dd>

<dd>Hey Cas - i finally figured out where you got that message. There used to be a ratherly firm size limit because back then a number of older browsers had size limits. Now, here is what WP says -</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>* <i>Though article size is no longer a binding rule, there remain stylistic reasons why the main body of an article should not be unreasonably long, including readability issues. It is instead treated as a guideline, and considered case by case depending on the nature of the article itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>* <i>For stylistic purposes, only the main body of prose[1] (excluding links, see also, reference and footnote sections, and lists/tables) should be counted toward an article's total size, since the point is to limit the size of the main body of prose.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So even tho we MIGHT, COULD and maybe even SHOULD merge medications articles with the existing Mood Stabilizers &amp; AD articles , currently, we don't have to worry as there is no portion of the article that is unreasonably long, certainly not to the point that it interfers with the readability and comprehension of the material. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 17:34, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Cas, you said (back up a ways)-&gt; The first time I had heard of the term (Non-BPD) was here on wikipedia and I have worked in mental health for over 10 years..."</p>
<p>The first time I noted it it was in the past few months. I have since seen that it seemingly comes straight from <i>support forums</i> for <i>Non's</i>. I don't like it and I don't think Wikipedia should encourage the use of the term. This is why I feel this way --&gt;</p>
<p>Because it instills an even greater distance between US and THEM. It implies <i>They are SICK, but WE are not sick</i>. It further stigmatizes those with BPD. And it objectifies them by labeling ourselves as <i>GOOD PEOPLE who are just the innocent victims of BPDs.</i></p>
<p>Suddenly those persons aren't fellow human beings, a parent, a child, a spouse, a friend, a coworker... they are a label. When someone comes on a support forum and says, I am a Non... then something is wrong with this picture. The Non's are distancing themselves, and by suggestion they are (and I find this on support forums for other PDs), implying that they have no mental illness.</p>
<p>And studies show that this is certainly no blanket assumption.</p>
<p>So I hope it can be avoided. <i>loved one of someone <b>With</b> BPD</i> than <i>the person married to <b>A</b> BPD</i>. <i><b>The</b> Non-BPD should treat <b>The</b> BPD this way</i>.</p>
<p>When you have BPD, you are not A BPD, not a label. You are far more than your disorder, more than a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Also, it is unfortunate that Borderline is an ancient term that stems from an out-moded notion that Borderlines were a shadow disorder existing between Normal People and Schizophrenics. I would like to see it changed in the next DSM.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll stop jumping up and down, yelling from my soapbox. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">Kiwi</a> 21:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem I have with the term is that everyone has issues (check transference nad countertransference) and we can all be in for a stormy time when interacting with people with BPD.

<dl>
<dd>The term "Non-BPD", "nonBP", or simply "Non" is used in the notable book <i>Stop Walking On Eggshells</i> and related internet forums to refer to a person without BPD who is in a close relationship with a person with BPD. It does not apply to the general public. I also would like to see the name changed to something more precise.</dd>
<dd>There should be a section here on "effect on others", describing briefly the problems that arise in people in close relationships. While everybody does have issues, the phenomenon of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Projective_identification.html" title="Projective identification">projective identification</a> does occur with significant regularity among "nonBPs."</dd>
<dd>From personal experience with two such people, I can verify that they <b>instinctively</b> use the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnNSe5XYp6E" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnNSe5XYp6E" rel="nofollow">mind control tactics (YouTube)</a> of cultists to <i>trick</i> people into caring for them and remaining in relationships. What they don't realize, can't realize on a fundamental emotional level, is that they don't <i>need</i> to trick people into loving them. There are people willing to befriend them, and even to love them, and who won't abandon them if things get rough. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueNight_546f.html" title="User:BlueNight">BlueNight</a> 15:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I HAVE AN IDEA!!!! Zeraeph, do you think it would be okay to place these inlined portions (them being entire paragraphs or more) into one of those funny little boxes I sometimes see - the are set off, if I recall exactly, with dashed lines all around them??? They may even be tinted a different color (?). How are those done? If you tell me how to make those things, I can do them this way. As fast as I can. That way I (and everyone else) can easily spot them and I don't have to search through the entire article for the inlined areas. And if anyone else wants to edit or contradict anything I wrote, they can certainly do so.

<dd>To be honest I felt most of the text I placed inline could be as easily deleted, except that some of it could be moved to articles it is specifically relevant to, not least because the size of the article is way out of control and some things have to go. Placing text inline was just an experiment in seeing how far that would reduce the article size and correct the balance in terms of the pharmacology appearing to "take over".</dd>

<dd>I have been looking at the Non section again, fully agreeing that it needs moving. All it would take is a mention on several Non-support groups, and they would be hip deep in editors.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A Kiwi</a> deleted this and the <i>Why do anticonvulsants "stabilize mood"?</i> headers. This is legitimate, because both of them were empty with nothing but an expand-section tag under them. Yet the reasoning of "it is simply too complicated to deal with on Wiki - it's a graduate-level topic" doesn't ring well with me. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; nowhere in the guidelines or mission-statement does it state that there's a threshold for the complexity level of an article; or if does, I've never seen as much. Graduate students and doctorants and even fully-fledged academics read and edit Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I feel that this is important information, and someone with the knowledge and understanding of it needs to create an explanation on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anticonvulsant.html" title="Anticonvulsant">Anticonvulsant</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipsychotic.html" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> might be a more appropriate place than here, but currently the former has no mention of mood disorders and the latter has one line about the drugs being used as mood stabilizers even if no psychosis is present. As I said, I'm not arguing against the deletion in practice, but against the conceptual deletion - the call that this information does not belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a> : <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a> : <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 08:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Now I find the forum owner of where I had posted so many journal research articles has still not restored archives, so must do it the longer, more difficult way. So many changes, hope I can find my way around. The first thing I have to post is some cutting edge research on the BPD/Bipolar overlap.

<p>Currently, the following is found under the heading of "Lack of impulse control", despite already being mentioned earlier in the Signs and Symptoms section: "<i>Rather than deciding whether they are heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, they often change their minds between the three, resulting in ignored feelings, confused emotions and an overactive imagination which usually makes the situation worse for them.</i>"</p>
<p>Firstly, "deciding whether they are heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual" seems highly innaccurate, both in the use of the word "deciding" and in stating that one must be either straight, gay or bi.</p>
<p>Secondly, why is this under the "Lack of impulse control" section at all?! Is one to "decide" on a sexuality and then feeling anything is to be classified as "lack of control" and a possible symptom of a mental disorder?</p>
<p>Should this section be removed completely or re-writing and moved (possibly to a new section on difficulties in the sense of self)? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.2.139.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.2.139.75_204a.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.2.139.75">contribs</a>) 07:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I also agree the pruning was necessary to tidy things and keep the focus. I do feel, though, that in some cases it's removed any reference to issues at the core of the disorder, some of the wording for which had been balanced through consensus discussions over time, which could make addressing and sourcing these issues more difficult. I added a lot of those "citations needed" tags a few weeks ago, I suppose it has been a while now. I would like to replace some of what was there and, over time, source it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 09:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's absolutely how I feel myself, but I also feel that, once properly sourced, a lot of the removed text would have to change for accuracy. There was a lot of wild speculation mixed up with core issues and no sources for either. (Truth is the intro itself needs sourcing or removing too, but I couldn't just remove THAT.)

<dd>In looking to add content and sources on the main features of BPD, there is an apparent problem of overlap with the list of DSM criteria which are themselves, of course, one attempt to outline the main features (at least, those seen as most clinically significant and diagnostically relevant).

<dd>Real can o' worms - could open up a whole section on how the discrete personality disorders in DSM IV lack validity and the most valid seems to be the generic criteria for Personlaity Disorder.

<dd>You are perfectly right, and we should draw the line there, at least in this section. What you are saying also concerns the general doubts about the diagnosis of this disorder and the way it is described in DSM-IV right now, as well as the fact that personality disorders are an under-researched topic. In another section, however, maybe a qulified addition about what is expected to change in DSM-V would be interesting. This section (Differential diagnosis)as it is is harmless and common knowledge, and sourced now. I'll put it back.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_E._Dougle_226e.html" title="User:Grace E.

<p>The consensus seems to be that Non-bpd is only notable if it can be cited to more than a single, POV, agenda-driven book (such as "Stop Walking on Eggshells"). I think I agree with that. I have known some of the people directly involved with the creation of this book and it's subsequent agenda and, though whatever I know is original research, and does not belong here, I can assure you I know nothing that suggests that they satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as sources for a medical article.</p>
<p>The worlds of online psychology is saturated with self appointed expertise that, even when it is not of dubious intent in it's own right, just adds to a growing volume of subjectivity, partial information and misinformation on the internet posted by self appointed experts.</p>
<p>The trouble is it is just TOO EASY fall into the trap of assuming that some of this misinformation is established and verified fact or academic theory, when, too often, it is just one person's, subjective, thinking.</p>
<p>I think it is very important on Wikipedia to dismiss all that misinformation and get back to established and verified fact or academic theory, from reputable sources and objective experts.

<dd>That discussion was about whether "non-BPD" merits an entire page, this is about a single mention. Perhaps you're right that the term doesn't need highlighting, but the edit was clarifying how the scientific usage differs from this popularized usage, which seems sensible to me. Regarding the book itself - self-published online psychology is one thing but this appears to be an independently published and widely sold book (with also published "workbook" or something), <a href="http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/paulchat.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/paulchat.htm" rel="nofollow">one of the authors</a> of which is a psychologist and which seems to be much discussed (note the use the book has apparently been put to, that he apparently regrets). In any case, it was explictly not being cited as a source of facts about BPD but as a significant example of some of the often controversial discourse around this, whether justified or not. This is interesting and relevant to the topic in my opinion (which has nothing to do with the extent to which this is seen as medical, about which there are different scientific and professional views of course). I very strongly agree about quality scientific sourcing, as I hope is apparent, but I also think mention of things like this shouldn't be excluded (and the actual policy page for this is <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, which links to a FAQ which says "Even if it is actually crankery, we have articles on Phlogiston, and on many less plausible political and social ideas, in order to explain what they are.") If you feel so strongly against this book, why not seek sources for alternative coverage of the issues or critiques of its agenda, rather than just deleting things, which is also too easy to do sometimes <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 20:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do think the main thing is to develop the article's coverage of relationship and family issues, including those that may be common but controversial. There is now some sourced balanced coverage of some of these issues - like being sensitive or insecure in attachment, or being (mis)perceived as manipulative or difficult. Overall I think the article's looking pretty good and well-sourced now... <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 12:32, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also agreed, basically, the focus of this aspect should be on relationship and family issues, NOT a single, non-notable, agenda driven book, so can I suggest that the priority be placed on presenting those relationship and family issues, and the "Non-BPD" issue not be mentioned until a good, academic, verifiable, start has been made on that? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 17:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's not quite accurate - the book and term were mentioned as one characterization of things, published in the pop lit, with other perspectives and related scientific findings explained and multiply sourced (as mentioned above). You feel the most strongly about this book and term so it's a shame you haven't provided sources on it and these issues. So I do agree it would be most helpful to focus on that, given that you don't want any of this mentioned at all for now <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 11:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I agree with Zeraeph. I work in the field and the material that was presented was just not up to par. By trying to define Non-bpds it undermines a whole lot of important material on the transference/countertransference (in psychotherapy) and on the understanding of a BPD's turbulent relationships and why they have them. For a concise, comprehensive summary there would be a waiting list of material which would have a priority higher than this. cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Casliber</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasliber_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Casliber">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Casliber_4aa0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Casliber">contribs</a> 12:44, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'material' was one sentence mentioning the usage and one mentioning a characterization exampled by the book, Casliber, I don't think we should keep getting hung up on it. Since I've added quite a lot of scientifically-sourced material on psychotherapy and relationship issues, I don't disagree about the importance of covering that (why don't you add something sourced on the transference issue? that perspective being largely linked to a psychanalytic perspective of course and currently obliquely covered re. TFP). Zeraeph, that sounds fine to me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 14:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I think the paragraph you added is great, and WAY better, and more honestly informative, than anything agenda driven. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 11:43, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
